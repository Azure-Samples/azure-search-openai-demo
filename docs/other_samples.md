# Alternative RAG chat samples

There are an increasingly large number of ways to build RAG chat apps.

## Other language samples

Inspired by this repo, there are similar apps for other languages:

* [**JavaScript**](https://aka.ms/azai/js/code)
* [**.NET**](https://aka.ms/azai/net/code)
* [**Java**](https://aka.ms/azai/java/code)

They do not all support the same features as this repo, but they provide a good starting point for building a RAG chat app in your preferred language.

## Other Python samples

Another popular repository for this use case is here:
[https://github.com/Microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT/](https://github.com/Microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT/)

That repository is designed for use by customers using Azure OpenAI studio and Azure Portal for setup. It also includes `azd` support for folks who want to deploy it completely from scratch.

The primary differences:

* This repository includes multiple RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches that chain the results of multiple API calls (to Azure OpenAI and ACS) together in different ways. The other repository uses only the built-in data sources option for the ChatCompletions API, which uses a RAG approach on the specified ACS index. That should work for most uses, but if you needed more flexibility, this sample may be a better option.
* This repository is also a bit more experimental in other ways, since it's not tied to the Azure OpenAI Studio like the other repository.
