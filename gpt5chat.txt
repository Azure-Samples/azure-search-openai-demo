<tr><th>answer</th><td>The Northwind Standard Benefits Details document explains that when using in-network providers, you typically pay a portion of the cost, such as a co-pay or co-insurance, with different services possibly having different co-pays or co-insurance amounts. In-network providers have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at discounted rates, so you pay only the portion not covered by the insurance plan.

Some services may not be covered at all, requiring out-of-pocket payment [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8][Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=10].

Specific services covered under the plan include preventive care services such as immunizations and screenings, as well as mental health and substance abuse services, which generally have coverage similar to medical and surgical services.

**How does the prior authorization process detailed in the Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf impact the out-of-pocket costs for services and medications, and what are the copayment expectations for in-network services as outlined in the same document?**

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>baseline</th><th>gpt5chat-emb3l</th><th>ground_truth</th></tr>
<tr><th>answer</th><td>The prior authorization process requires your insurance company to review and verify the need for a service or procedure, primarily for out-of-network services. If prior authorization is denied, you may be responsible for all costs associated with the care. Exceptions exist when care is not available in-network, where prior authorization may be waived. This process helps ensure appropriate care and coverage by your plan but can impact your out-of-pocket costs if authorization is not obtained or denied [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=66][Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=67].

For in-network services under Northwind Health Plus, copayments are approximately $20 for primary care visits, $50 for specialist visits, and $100 for emergency services. Preventive care services typically have no copayment. Copayments for out-of-network services are higher and you may be responsible for additional costs beyond copayments [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=11].</td><td>If pre-authorization or pre-certification is not obtained, you may be responsible for the full cost of the services, which can significantly increase your out-of-pocket expenses [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=16].

For in-network services, you are still responsible for any applicable copays, coinsurance, or deductibles in addition to the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus pays [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=16].

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>baseline</th><th>gpt5chat-emb3l</th><th>ground_truth</th></tr>
<tr><th>answer</th><td>Using in-network providers under Northwind Health Plus Benefits results in lower out-of-pocket costs because Northwind Health has negotiated discounted rates with these providers. Your coinsurance responsibility will generally be lower with in-network providers. In contrast, using out-of-network providers may lead to paying the full cost of services, higher deductibles, and higher coinsurance. Additionally, you might have to pay the difference between the provider's billed amount and what the plan pays. Emergency services are covered both in-network and out-of-network, but out-of-network emergency care may also result in higher copayments and coinsurance [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=27].</td><td>Using in-network providers lowers your coinsurance responsibilities because Northwind Health has negotiated discounted rates, resulting in lower out-of-pocket costs compared to out-of-network providers [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=108].
Using out-of-network providers means higher coinsurance and possibly paying the full cost of services, plus any difference between the provider’s bill and the plan’s payment [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=108].</td><td>Using in-network providers under the Northwind Health Plus Benefits can result in lower coinsurance rates, meaning the policyholder will pay less for the same service. However, if out-of-network providers are used, the policyholder will be responsible for a larger portion of the cost, and in some cases, may be responsible for the entire cost. This highlights the importance of checking if a provider is in-network before selecting a plan to manage out-of-pocket costs effectively.

**What happens if you use out-of-network providers according to Northwind Health Plus?**

<tr><th></th><th>baseline</th><th>gpt5chat-emb3l</th><th>ground_truth</th></tr>
<tr><th>answer</th><td>If you use out-of-network providers with Northwind Health Plus, you should first confirm if the services are covered by the plan. Out-of-network providers may charge more than in-network providers, and Northwind Health Plus does not guarantee the amount charged by out-of-network providers. You are responsible for any balance remaining after the plan pays its portion. Prior authorization is still required for some services even if provided out-of-network, although exceptions exist for certain services. Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for out-of-network services unless they are medically necessary and not available from an in-network provider. You may need to submit documentation such as itemized bills, proof of payment, and medical records to receive reimbursement. Keeping detailed records of all medical services and payments is important to ensure full reimbursement under the policy [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=71][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=81].</td><td>Using an out-of-network provider usually means higher copayments and coinsurance, and they may not accept the same reimbursement rates, making care significantly more expensive. Services may not count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, and you could face balance billing for the difference between the provider’s charges and what Northwind Health Plus pays [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=108].

Exceptions include certain medically necessary services like emergency care, outpatient mental health, skilled nursing, durable medical equipment, and some radiology services, where prior authorization is not required but the provider must submit a claim for review [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=70].

Do you want me to list the exceptions in detail?</td><td>If you use out-of-network providers according to Northwind Health Plus, you will be responsible for a larger portion of the cost.

<tr><th></th><th>baseline</th><th>gpt5chat-emb3l</th><th>ground_truth</th></tr>
<tr><th>answer</th><td>To effectively manage out-of-pocket costs while coordinating benefits with another employer plan, a policyholder should:

1. Use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network, as this ensures lower out-of-pocket costs due to negotiated discounted rates and proper coordination of benefits [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=77][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3].

2. Provide information about the other employer plan when using Northwind Health Plus to coordinate benefits correctly [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=77].

3. Understand the plan's rules for coordinating benefits, including exceptions such as not coordinating with non-major medical plans or high-deductible plans until the deductible is met [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=77].

4. Ask healthcare providers about the cost of services before receiving them to avoid unexpected expenses [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=77].

5. Keep track of all out-of-pocket expenses and be aware of the plan's annual deductible and coinsurance amounts [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75].

Following these steps will help a policyholder manage costs effectively when coordinating benefits with another employer plan using in-network providers.</td><td>To manage out-of-pocket costs effectively while coordinating benefits with another employer plan, you should:

- Use **in-network providers** to take advantage of Northwind Health Plus’s negotiated discounted rates, which lower your out-of-pocket costs [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3].
- Understand your **annual deductible, coinsurance amounts, and coverage limits**, and keep track of all out-of-pocket expenses [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75].
- When coordinating benefits with another employer plan, that plan will usually pay first, and Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance **only if you use an in-network provider** [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=76].

Do you want me to also include tips for coordinating benefits if you have Medicare?</td><td>To effectively manage out-of-pocket costs while coordinating benefits with another employer plan, a policyholder should use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network. This is crucial as in-network providers have agreed to charge lower rates for their services, which can help save money on out-of-pocket costs.

It is also important to understand the plan's rules for coordinating benefits and to inquire about the cost of services before receiving them to ensure benefits are coordinated correctly and cost-effectively.

**Considering the Northwind Health Plus benefits, how does choosing an in-network provider affect the out-of-pocket costs for a policyholder, and what are the covered services under hospice care according to the plan?**

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>baseline</th><th>gpt5chat-emb3l</th><th>ground_truth</th></tr>
<tr><th>answer</th><td>Choosing an in-network provider with Northwind Health Plus generally results in lower out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder. In-network hospital services are covered at 100%, so you won't be responsible for additional costs, although copayments or coinsurance may apply depending on the service type. Out-of-network providers may result in significantly higher costs, and services may not count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. You may also face balance billing for the difference between provider charges and plan payments. Exceptions exist for emergencies or when traveling outside the U.S. without in-network options [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=6][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=34].

Regarding hospice care, Northwind Health Plus covers services including palliative care, bereavement services, and support groups, which provide emotional and spiritual support to members and their families during difficult times. It is recommended to discuss with your doctor about additional hospice services that may be available [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=34].</td><td>Using an in-network provider with Northwind Health Plus lowers your out-of-pocket costs because the plan has negotiated discounted rates with them, and you may also receive additional discounts or cost savings. Out-of-network care generally results in higher costs, including possibly paying the full cost, higher deductibles, and coinsurance [Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=4][Northwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=9].

I don't know what services are covered under hospice care for this plan.</td><td>Choosing an in-network provider under the Northwind Health Plus plan significantly affects the out-of-pocket costs for a policyholder by reducing them. When a policyholder uses in-network providers, they pay lower out-of-pocket costs compared to using out-of-network providers, where they would be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. Regarding hospice care, the Northwind Health Plus coverage includes care from a hospice team, medications, medical supplies, equipment for treating the terminal illness, counseling for the member and their family, inpatient and respite care, grief counseling, and bereavement services. However, it does not cover services intended to cure the terminal illness, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.
