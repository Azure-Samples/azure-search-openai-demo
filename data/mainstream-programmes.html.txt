programmes - information for employersIf you're an employer, you can support someone with a disability or health condition, including mental health and neurodiversity, into work through one of our Mainstream programmes. We may be able to help by paying wage subsidies, other funding and on-the-job support.How it worksAn Employment Service provider will work with your organisation to find a suitable placement for a candidate, depending on their skills and employment goals.We'll give you either a partial or full wage subsidy, funding for training and equipment, as well as on-the-job support. The type of funding and how much we'll pay depends on what programme the client is in.If you decide to hire the client permanently after their placement finishes, let us know.Which organisations can take partWhen we look to place someone in your organisation, we'll check:how many people are in your organisationwhether it's safe and suitable for the candidatethe wages are the same as what you would pay other people doing similar workthe candidate will work between 15-40 hours a week. We'll also look at whether you have:experience employing and supporting a range of employeesestablished HR policies and procedurespractical experience to work through performance issues, disputes or other issuesopportunities for the candidate to get an ongoing job once the placement finishes. In most cases, we can only fund one candidate from a Mainstream programme at a time. If you want to place more than one candidate, email us at mainstream@msd.govt.nzWhat our Mainstream programmes offerThese programmes support people with disabilities or health conditions, including mental health and neurodiversity, to get paid work experience. Ideally the client would also get the chance to stay on in an ongoing role after their placement, if you decide to offer this to them.There are three Mainstream programmes:Mainstream Employment programmeThis programme runs for up to one year. It's for clients who are getting a main benefit from us, and have a disability or health condition which significantly affects their ability to find work, which they need extra financial support for.If you place someone from the Mainstream Employment programme, you'll get:an 80% wage subsidy for the first six monthsa 50% wage subsidy for the last six monthsfunding for: training outside of work that's not usually provided to other employeesspecialised equipment if the client needs it because of their disabilityother assistance related to the client's disability, eg. transport.   We'll pay you back for any training or specialist equipment the candidate may need. This needs to be agreed to in the contract before the placement starts. If we pay for any specialist equipment, it will belong to the candidate. This means they can take it with them when their placement ends.Mainstream Internship programmeThis programme runs for up to 12 weeks. It's for Be.Lab clients who are in their last two years of study, or have finished full-time study in the last 12 months. The internships will give the client an opportunity to work in a field related to their study.If you place someone in the Mainstream Internship Programme, we'll pay the client's full wages to you while the client is on placement.Mainstream Paid Work Experience programme:This programme runs for up to 16 weeks. It's for Be.Lab clients who are starting work in an industry they haven't worked in before.If you place someone in the Mainstream Paid Work Experience Programme, we'll pay the client's full wages to you while the client is on placement.Wage subsidies for the programmesWe pay wage subsidies quarterly in advance.Wage subsidies don't cover:ACC leviesKiwisaver contributionsholiday pay, orother employer costs.
