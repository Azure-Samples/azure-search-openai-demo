My two decades of electronics engineering experience includes both hardware and software design and development for electronic systems.A particular achievement I’m proud of was being part of the team that delivered a viable test system for Pyper Vision, meeting a challenging deadline. It enables aircraft to take off and land in foggy conditions. This experience highlighted my ability to thrive in high-pressure environments while ensuring quality and meeting client expectations.My expertise includes software design using languages such as C/C++ and Python. I am proficient in using LabVIEW for developing software solutions. In hardware design, I have extensive experience with tools like Altium and Fusion 360 for PCB design. I am also expert in embedded systems and PCB assembly, allowing me to tackle complex engineering challenges holistically.I thrive on the opportunity to apply my skills and expertise to contribute to the success of Callaghan Innovation projects within the field of Advanced Mechatronics.BackAreas of expertiseSoftware designC/C++PythonLabviewHardware designAltiumFusion 360Embedded systemsPCB assemblyEducationBE (Hons) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Canterbury, 2004ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
