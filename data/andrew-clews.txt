My involvement extends to representing Callaghan Innovation within the Consortium for Medical Device Technologies (CMDT), serving on the Advisory Board of Te Titoki Mataora – The Medtech Translator and delivery of the HealthTech Activator (HTA).My admiration lies with clinicians who venture into uncharted territory, scaling new technologies to enhance the quality of people's lives. This passion for innovation and transformative impact led me to Callaghan Innovation in 2014, after a 16-year career in the United States, where I worked across diverse sectors, from electromechanical devices to life sciences.My expertise spans executive roles in business internationalisation, coupled with a track record in successfully commercialising new technologies, products, and brands within complex categories. I’ve also completed the start-up through IPO journey myself and in translating this experience into my role at Callaghan Innovation, I aim to assist these innovative businesses in achieving ambitious growth goals, ensuring that groundbreaking technologies reach the market and make a tangible difference in people's lives.BackAreas of expertiseHealthtechDeeptechCommercialisationScale-up EducationBachelor of Arts, Business/Marketing; Political Science, The University of AucklandGraduate School of Management, Finance for Non-Financial Managers, The University of AucklandGraduate School of Management, Governance, The University of AucklandGraduate School of Management, Lean Appreciation, The University of AucklandThe University of AucklandStay informedFirst NameLast NameEmail AddressYou must enable JavaScript to submit this formReceive news, events, and opportunities that could drive innovation in your business.
