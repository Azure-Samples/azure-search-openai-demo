Callaghan funded internships have become an integral part of MEA's recruitment and training programme. The scheme enables us to give students/new-grads an opportunity to work on real world R&D projects in a commercial setting. Students/new grads are also provided with the opportunity to continue to learn."Rod MacFarlaneDirector, MEA Mobile Limited"Cetogenix is thankful for the opportunity to add resource to our team at this early stage of our start up phase. Ciara brought an extra set of hands to establish a fermentation laboratory from scratch, which included procurement, documentation and asset recording, and also performed a range of technical support duties."Trevor StuthridgeCEO, Cetogenix Limited"I am a strong proponent for the R&D Experience student grant. We genuinely would not have been able to hire these students if not for the grant, and I'm confident that the internship programme was hugely impactful on them and their future career. Our interns now have strong industry connections, realistic working experience, and will be well equipped to enter the workforce at the completion of their studies. We are closely following at least one of the students and hope to make full-time offers to them at the completion of their tertiary studies.  "Oliver ShawChief Technology Officer, Jasper Property Limited"Because this project was research-oriented, it was risky for us as a self-funded business to take on. Callaghan Innovation’s support to take on interns helped us de-risk the project, and meant we could work on something more innovative."Grant JohnsonCEO, Rocketspark"Callaghan Innovation has been a massive help to our business. By working with them, and AUT and Waikato universities, we’ve been able to find a lot of talent in the right areas to fuel our R&D pipeline."Luke ButtersR&D Manager, Hectre"Cetogenix is thankful for the opportunity to add resource to our team at this early stage of our start up phase. Ciara brought an extra set of hands to establish a fermentation laboratory from scratch, which included procurement, documentation and asset recording, and also performed a range of technical support duties.
