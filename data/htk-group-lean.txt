Our Lean team is supported by our business advisory team, which provides ancillary support throughout our engagements with clients. We have extensive knowledge and experience and relish the opportunity to share this with our clients.Lean Service Delivery Methodologies Lean is a collaborative process, so we work closely with clients and their teams to build buy-in throughout the organisation. We want everyone to see the success and benefits of Lean so that they independently look for more.Our goal is to encourage and implement a culture of continuous and ongoing improvement by guiding our clients through the journey – educating, sharing key techniques and showing success. Our first step is getting to know our clients, their business and current goals. Using our experience and methodologies we take a business through our process, investigating key areas throughout the supply chain to maximise workflow – from customers’ orders through to finished product and sales. Communication is key throughout the journey. Together we will take business goals; break them down to specific, easy-to-follow project plans; then allocate resources (creating resources if needed) and timeframes – all while generating buyin. Each project plan can have a client lead, or ‘project champion’, monitoring and encouraging progress. Their exposure will be measured by our Lean team to ensure they are learning with the right levels of support and challenges.BackContactshttps://htkltd.co.nz/Pete Burgesspete@htkltd.co.nz021 159 9920Sector expertiseAreas of experienceLean concept implementation and adoption (Six Sigma, TOC, JIT) ERP/MRP systems enhancement and systems integration (go-live readiness) Change management and support Supply-chain optimisation and outsourcingDigital tools to maximise efficiencies and opportunitiesInventory controlBuilding high-performance teamsHealth and safetySector ExperienceManufacturing and industrial Sheet metal fabrication Automotive sector Warehousing and logistics Food and beverage StartupsDigital technologyWorking with us onLeanFounder and Startup Support programmePricingPricing is dependent upon the type of support required, ranging from $250 per hour to $1,800 - $2,400 per day.Related ProductsPrevNext1 / 2Lean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read moreStartup and Founder SupportTurbo-charge your startup with accelerators and other growth programmes, delivered by trusted partners, and part-funded by Callaghan Innovation.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
