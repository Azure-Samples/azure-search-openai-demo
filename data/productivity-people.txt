We facilitate the creation of an environment where Continuous Improvement is the norm.We use our own method based on proven Lean and Continuous Improvement methodologies, the Productivity Programme. This includes an initial best practice assessment and custom 90-day & 12-month plans. To improve operational practices, participants have 24-hour access to our learning portal which has step-by-step ‘how-to’ guides, industry-specific New Zealand examples, ready to use templates, and inbuild self-tests. Our consultants support, mentor, and coach your people on their improvement journey.Our programme will lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness by reducing the time spent on non-value-adding activities and optimizing the flow of work. Such waste can include overproduction, waiting time, unnecessary transportation, excess inventory, unnecessary processing, and defects. The results are better outcomes for the customers, as well as the people of the enterprise, its shareholders, the wider community, and the natural environment.Productivity People is fully New Zealand owned and made up of Lean/Continuous Improvement and operations professionals who have worked in Lean environments for many decades.
