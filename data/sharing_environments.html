<h1 id="rag-chat-sharing-deployment-environments">RAG chat: Sharing
deployment environments</h1>
<p>If you’ve deployed the RAG chat solution already following the steps
in the <a href="../README.md#deploying">deployment guide</a>, you may
want to share the environment with a colleague. Either you or they can
follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install the <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure
CLI</a></li>
<li>Run <code>azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo</code> or clone this
repository.</li>
<li>Run <code>azd env refresh -e {environment name}</code> They will
need the azd environment name, subscription ID, and location to run this
command. You can find those values in your
<code>.azure/{env name}/.env</code> file. This will populate their azd
environment’s <code>.env</code> file with all the settings needed to run
the app locally.</li>
<li>Set the environment variable <code>AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID</code> either
in that <code>.env</code> file or in the active shell to their Azure ID,
which they can get with <code>az ad signed-in-user show</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>./scripts/roles.ps1</code> or
<code>.scripts/roles.sh</code> to assign all of the necessary roles to
the user. If they do not have the necessary permission to create roles
in the subscription, then you may need to run this script for them. Once
the script runs, they should be able to run the app locally.</li>
</ol>
