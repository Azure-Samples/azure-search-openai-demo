The Companies Office administers prohibition following mismanagement, and prohibition following conviction.What prohibition meansIf a prohibition order is issued against you, you can't:act as a director or promoter of a companytake part, directly or indirectly, in the management of a company.The length of your ban depends on which section of the Companies Act 1993 you're prohibited under.Prohibition following mismanagementThe decision to issue a prohibition order against an individual for mismanagement rests with the Registrar of Companies. The Registrar considers several factors when making their decision including, but not limited to:the protection of the publicsetting of standardsdeterrence.Prohibition following mismanagement is dealt with under Section 385 of the Companies Act 1993.                                                             Companies Act 1993 — Section 385                                                                New Zealand Legisation                                        The decision to prohibitWe identify appropriate candidates for prohibition from various sources, including liquidators, media outlets and members of the public.The candidate must have been a director or manager of 1 or more companies that have failed in the previous 5 years — for example, a company that has been placed into voluntary administration, receivership or liquidation.We assess whether mismanagement contributed to the failure of the company, or companies. If so, the candidate is notified and given time to make submissions or representations.This process differs between single and multiple company failures. If the candidate for prohibition has been a director or manager of:1 failed company, we must be satisfied that mismanagement has occurred.2 or more failed companies, the candidate must satisfy us that:all, or all but 1, of the companies were not mismanaged, orthat it would not be just or equitable for us to prohibit them.We're given all relevant information to make an informed decision, and will:prohibit the individual from managing companies for a period of up to 10 years, ornot prohibit the individual for various reasons — for example, if unable to establish (in the case of a single company failure) that mismanagement caused the failure of the company.Our enforcement approachProhibition following convictionAn individual is automatically prohibited from managing a company following a conviction for an offence in connection with:the promotion, formation, or management of a company, ora dishonesty offence under the Crimes Act 1961.                                                             Crimes Act 1961                                                                New Zealand Legisation                                        Automatic disqualification following convictionImportant        Where the Registrar of Companies becomes aware that a person is prohibited from being a director or involved in the management of companies under section 382 of the Companies Act 1993, that person is listed as ‘disqualified’ in a searchable database maintained by the Registrar. That database includes persons prohibited by the Registrar under section 385.The Registrar is not aware of or notified of all persons who have been convicted of offences that result in their prohibition under section 382.Persons who have been convicted of relevant offences are prohibited by virtue of section 382 whether or not their names appear on the database.The database does not include undischarged bankrupts.    You can't be a director if you've been:convicted of any offence in connection with the promotion, formation, or management of a company, orconvicted of a dishonesty offence as defined in the Crimes Act 1961 — for example, theft, fraud, deception, pecuniary advantage.The disqualification takes effect from the date of your conviction, and lasts for 5 years.Under Section 382 of the Companies Act, an individual is automatically disqualified following conviction if they've been convicted of:any offence in connection with the promotion, formation, or management of a company, ora dishonesty offence as defined in the Crimes Act 1961— for example, theft, fraud, deception or pecuniary advantage.
