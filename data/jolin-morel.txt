My specialism is in high value processes such as Supercritical CO2 extraction.Before joining Callaghan Innovation my doctorate was in the freezing process for ovine milk. I used this to develop a novel freezing process. I have also worked on drying methods for high-value products, non-thermal pasteurisation methods, and processes for converting by-products into high value foods.Few people realise that food technology is not cooking, it’s rather closer to chemical engineering.My work typically involves developing new processes for clients or scaling processes from lab-scale to pilot scale. Working with a customer to make high-value nutritional products from primary industry by-products we started at benchtop scale and worked the project through to full commercial prototype production. I am also working on developing processes to transform the marine product industry as part of the Cyber-Marine project.BackAreas of expertiseSupercritical and liquified gas extractions.Food process engineeringEnergy and mass balancesNovel food processing technologiesFreezing processesDairy processingEducationPhD in Food Technology, Massey University, BE (Hons) Chemical and Nanotechnology, Massey UniversityMemberships and awardsMEngNZ - Member of Engineering NZNZIFST (New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology)IIFIIR (International Institute of Refrigeration) Commission B1-Thermodynamics& Transfer ProcessesSelected publicationsComparison of drying techniques for bovine lactoferrin: Iron binding and antimicrobial properties of dried lactoferrin, Jolin Morel, Siti Norbaizura Md Zain, Richard Archer, International Dairy Journal, vol 124, 2022.Process and apparatus for phase-change extrusion of aqueous material, Accepted Australian patent AU 2020285590 B2 ARCHER, Richard Hamilton ; ROBERTSON, Lindsay James ; MOREL, JolinArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
