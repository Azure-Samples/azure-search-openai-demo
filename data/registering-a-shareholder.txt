Following incorporation, you must register each new shareholder and update your shareholding details as events occur.Who can be a shareholderYou can only register a shareholder in your company if they're:an individual personan NZ company, oranother legal entity, such as an overseas registered company or limited partnership.Important        You can't register an unincorporated trust, for example, a family trust. Instead you must register each trustee as holding shares jointly. Some legislation — for example, the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and the Maori Land Act 1993 — does allow for an exception to this rule. In this case, seek legal advice before registering a new shareholder.    Registering shareholders when you incorporateWhen you submit your online application for incorporation, you must register each shareholder.                                                                                 Incorporating a                                            company                                You must record each shareholder's personal details and state how many shares they hold in your company. Depending on the type of shareholder, you need to provide:for individuals — a full legal name, residential address, and an Inland Revenue number if the shareholder is an New Zealand resident, and you're registering your company for tax.for registered New Zealand companies — a full company name and incorporation or registration number.for trustees — a full legal name and residential address for each trustee jointly holding shares.for other entities — a full legal name, country of origin and registered address.Note        Where an application to incorporate meets certain criteria, we may request additional identification for a proposed shareholder.     Filing shareholder consent formsOnce you've added a shareholder's details to the Companies Register, we email you a consent form in that person's name. This form must be signed by the shareholder and returned to us within 20 working days.

Otherwise you must contact us to request both a correction to their details, and a replacement consent form.
