You can identify process bottle-necks and implement predictive and preventative maintenance. Sensors can provide live updates on your production process as well as identifying when tools are becoming worn or require maintenance.Digital twin: modelling your product and processesUsing the data collected by sensors and building a computer model of your product or process will allow you to create a Digital Twin. This will give you real-time status updates on your product and processes, as well as going through ‘what-if?’ scenarios, without putting your assets at risk.Robots and automation: increased efficiency and precision, reduced health & safety risksModern production systems are increasingly automated. However you can also retrofit automation to existing and older machinery to improve performance. Integration of assistive robots, e.g. to perform repetitive and dangerous tasks, delivers further benefits.Supporting the manufacturing sectorWe offer a range of Industry 4.0 related products and services to help manufacturers to grow and flourish.Smart Factory Assessment: Industry 4.0Expert analysis of your manufacturing capabilities, using an internationally recognised standard, to benchmark your business against competitors and set future goals.Read MoreDigital Manufacturing ChallengeJoin the Digital Manufacturing Challenge, an in-person event led by our LMAC experts, to see Industry 4.0 solutions in action at our digital factory.read more Mobile Showcase: Industry 4.0A bite-sized introduction to the world of Industry 4.0, and its core technologies, at this free, hands-on touring workshop.read moreSmart Factory Showcase: Industry 4.0Discover how a leading manufacturer implements and benefits from Industry 4.0 technologies, through this immersive multimedia tour and workshop.read moreLean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read MoreAdvanced Engineering and MaterialsWe help you to make engineering decisions and material choices confidently, accelerating your design and development process.Read MoreData VisionHarness the capabilities of AI and Machine Learning to extract maximum value from your data and enhance business efficiency.Read MoreResourcesCase StudiesInnovation is never easy, but we help our customers beat the odds and succeed anyway.
