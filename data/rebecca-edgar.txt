My background is in Biochemistry and I’m skilled in a variety of molecular biology and microbiology techniques, as well as small scale fermentationMy work has involved identifying new antimicrobials, the development of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, optimising recombinant protein expression, and novel approaches to animal feed.I was honoured to work supporting New Zealand's response to the Covid-19 pandemic by undertaking R&D towards a Covid-19 vaccine. An exciting part of microbiology is the ability of microorganisms to occupy virtually every environment on earth. I see this representing a huge, and largely untapped, biotechnology potential. And I hope to play a part in commercialising that future research.BackAreas of expertiseBacterial culturing and manipulationProtein expression and purificationEnzyme activity and antimicrobial assaysGene expression analysisProduction of new foods and food ingredientsFermentation in small scale bioreactorsEducationPhD, Biochemistry, University of Otago, 2014Memberships and awardsMember of New Zealand Microbiological Society (NZMS)Member Association of Biosafety for Australia and New Zealand (ABSANZ)Selected publicationsProcess development for the production of starter cultures for use in food fermentation, Harvey, S., Edgar, R., Rose, R.
