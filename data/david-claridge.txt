In my work I have a strong desire to improve the economic wellbeing of all New Zealanders, in particular to create better jobs. As a result of my work, some of the companies I've helped now employ between 20 and 50 people in well-paid jobs.I’m proud to have achieved $10 million Research & Development funding during 2020 for over 80 ventures. This was matched-funded by the businesses so in total $20m was spent on R&D that year.Climate innovator Professor Shaun Hendy, at Toha, is an inspirational leader who shows the importance to Aotearoa of commercialising research. Yet research is only part of the story behind success. An interesting fact about Research and Development is that during the process of innovation, technical issues are usually resolved more easily than commercial ones. For an innovation to thrive requires shifting focus from the technical to the commercial.BackAreas of expertiseCommercialisation of technology ideasInnovation support (commercial and technical)Knowledge of, and connections into, the Auckland innovation ecosystem - I know lots of peopleEducationPGCert, Commercialisation and Entrepreneurship, University of Auckland, 2012MBA, Cranfield University (UK), 1991MSc hons, Geophysics, University of Auckland, 1982ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
