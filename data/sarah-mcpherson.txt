I am passionate about driving business success.  I find inspiration in working with our local Southland business owners, who often achieve global success, but stay humble and true to their Southland roots.Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work within three highly successful Southland-based exporter businesses. I gained invaluable insights that I am eager to share with business owners looking to expand and develop.As we work towards building a robust network of business support organisations in Murihiku Southland to ensure success for the region, I fully embrace the wisdom in this whakataukī:Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini | My strength is not that of an individual but that of the collective.BackAreas of expertiseManagement AccountingFinanceOperations ManagementSupply and LogisticsHuman ResourcesStrategic PlanningLean ManufacturingEducationBCom, Accounting, University of Otago, 2007CA, Chartered Accountants Australia & New Zealand, 2010.Memberships and awardsMember of Chartered Accountants Australia & New ZealandArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
