We're deeply committed to the resilience and sustainability of Aotearoa, to tangata whenua, and to serving our diverse population. To design effective, sustainable solutions, we know we must prioritise diversity of voice and experience in everything we do.We're on a transformative journey, guided by a justice-oriented approach to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We’re committed to transparent reporting on our pay and representation gaps, and we're actively working to eliminate them.For us, true innovation comes from welcoming diversity of thought, life experience, abilities, and cultural/ethnic backgrounds. We actively foster an equitable, inclusive culture where everyone feels valued and able to be themselves.As of August, 2023Gender pay gap is 7.1%Māori + Pacific pay gap is 15.4%Asian pay gap is 12.7%Our Executive Leadership is 50% femaleKia Toipoto Action PlanTo learn more about what we're doing to address pay equity and ethnic representation, see our Kai Toipoto Action Plan.

To protect employee confidentiality - and for statistical accuracy - we’re unable to calculate pay gaps for groups of less than 20. This means we’ve aggregated our Māori and Pacific employee population in order to report on them. Numbers of Middle Eastern, Latin American + African employees (MELAA) within the org are too low to report on. Low numbers also mean we’re unable to disaggregate male and female ethnicity data. Māori, Pacific and Asian pay gaps are calculated via hourly wage relative to Pākehā / NZ European hourly wage. This is also how we’ve calculated our own Māori & Pacific pay gap and our Asian pay gap. Stats NZ calculates national gender pay gap using median pay.August 2023 |  8.6%  Pay gaps for other major groupsMaleFemaleMāori pay gap16.7%23.0%Pacific pay gap22.9%24.0%Asian pay gap10.9% 17.4%NZ Gender Pay Gap information provided by Stats NZ; Māori, Pacific and Asian Pay Gap information is provided by Motu Research & Mind The Gap. ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
