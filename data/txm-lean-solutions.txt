We then design a tailored programme and action plan to take your business where it needs to go. Ongoing support is provided with the skills development and coaching at every stage ensuring your objectives are achieved. We have delivered sustainable bottom-line improvements across almost every aspect of business, from plant layout, to supply-chain design, office and administrative processes, sales processes and engineering. We also help our clients address organisational structure and develop the right people to successfully lead the change. Our approach to Lean implementation is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. We work with you to tailor a solution, get hands-on with you as you pilot the solution, then give you time to trial and reflect on the new processes before returning to your site to ‘check’ the results and ‘act’ to lock in the change. We understand the busy world of SMEs so we focus on the concepts, principles, tools, and techniques that will efficiently and effectively facilitate change. Our coaching is highly flexible, usually delivered where people work and involves short sessions with individuals and small groups, maximising the retention rate for new ideas. Projects are broken into stages to provide an opportunity for review at each stage, with a typical project taking 10–12 months. Our focus on achieving results means that most customers achieve returns that exceed five times their investment.Working with us onLean CoachingPricingTXM projects are billed on the basis of a flat fee to deliver agreed client objectives. We provide a warranty to customers that if those objectives are not delivered we will continue to work at our own expense until they are delivered.Related ProductsPrevNext1 / 1Lean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
