We received a Student Career R&D grant from Callaghan Innovation in 2014.[Kyle Wang]I found an internship opportunity at Volapara Solutions website, we filed an application for Callaghan Innovation Career grant. For my internship I worked on developing [unclear] mammogram processing techniques to facilitate the diagnosis of breast disease.[David Murray]The prototype that Kyle developed was a success and we will soon release a new product where this work features heavily.[Kyle Wang]During my six months at Callaghan innovation internship, I learned how to be a good team player. Volpara Solutions offers me an opportunity and to engage deeply with other scientists and engineers to work together on science projects. [David Murray]Our company relies on our ability to innovate. Being a small company Callaghan Innovation has provided us with this capacity and it's integral in our ability to continue to do business.[Kyle Wang]So I am working full-time in Volpara Solutions as an Imaging Scientist.[David Murray]The students that have worked for us in the past have been PhD graduates in science image processing or computer science or a related field.[Kyle Wang]So I think, being open-minded is a very important, you know practical challenge and also I always love it when the boss makes jokes. [David Murray]My advice to companies thinking of applying for Callaghan innovation grant is to think big, when we look at the fantastic features that we've got out of this grant, and of grants in the past then it was well worth it.Benefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2Support future talentGive future innovators their first career stepping stone to gain valuable real-world R&D experience.Fill 1 Copy 2Introduce fresh thinkingInquisitive minds, helping you think outside of the box and approach challenges differently.Fill 1 Copy 2Accelerate R&D projectsProgress your research and development projects.Fill 1 Copy 2Salary supportThe first six months' salary (up to a capped amount) is covered by the grant.Is this right for me?Eligibility criteriaBusiness eligibilityTo apply for the grant, your business must offer an R&D position which provides the student or recent graduate with a worthwhile experience, and plays a positive part in their professional development.

Project has come up with great outcomes (better than expected). With solutions that were not expected (some of which came from innovative solutions from the student). Could not speak highly enough of how things went."Sam MackenzieExecutive Director, Nova Consulting "Callaghan Innovation has been a massive help to our business. By working with them, and AUT and Waikato universities, we’ve been able to find a lot of talent in the right areas to fuel our R&D pipeline."Luke ButtersR&D Manager, HectreFrequently asked questionsTo be eligible a business must have an ‘active R&D programme’. What does this mean? This means that the business must have:an in-house R&D programmea recent history of R&D activities over the preceding year and an R&D plan for the upcoming year; anda minimum of one R&D full time equivalent (FTE) employed by the business.See our guide to describing your R&D. How many Student Grants can I apply for? Two current R&D Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff are required for each student and this 2:1 ratio applies regardless of the type of grant (Fellowship Grant, Career Grant or Experience Grant). The exception is when the business has only one R&D FTE - in this case one student can be applied for.If a business only qualifies for one student at a time due to having 1 R&D staff member, and a current student grant is nearing completion, a business may apply for another student grant (Career or R&D Experience) provided the end date of the existing grant is no later than 2 months from the date of the new application. E.g. Fellowship grant will complete on 30 June, business may apply for another student grant no earlier than 1 May for a 1 July start date in order to maintain the 2:1 RDT FTE to student ratio.Read all of the frequently asked questions on the R&D Career Grants Resource Hub.ResourcesdocxGroup 10 Copy 4Career Grant - Application Guidelines and Template262 KBGrouppdfGroup 10 Copy 4Career Grant - Funding Agreement 444 KBGrouppdfGroup 10 Copy 4Career Grant - Information for Students76 KBGroupdocxGroup 10 Copy 4Career Grant - Number of Students per Business Guide135 KBGroupMinisterial Direction for Student GrantsExternal LinkR&D Career Grant Resource HubA full list of resources can be found on our R&D Career Grant Resource Hub.Read MoreMeet our expertsSee allPrevNext1 / 6Spencer WillisGM Funding EngagementDriving positive change throughout the customer experience                                                                                    I work as the General Manager of Funding Engagement at Callaghan Innovation where we guide and support innovators through the funding process for their breakthrough ideas.
