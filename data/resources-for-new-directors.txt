Some directors may authorise another person to complete this on their behalf, such as their solicitor or accountant.To complete your annual return, you confirm your company’s details that are recorded on the Companies Register. We’ll ask you to update any details that have changed. You don’t need to provide any financial information in your annual return. A tax return is different and is collected by Inland Revenue.Important        If you don’t complete your annual return, the Registrar will have grounds to remove your company from the register. This could have serious implications for your company, especially if it’s still trading or has assets.    When to complete your annual returnYou don't need to complete an annual return in the first calendar year of your company’s incorporation. For example, if you started your company in 2024 your first annual return won't be due until 2025.We will send you an email when your company’s annual return is due. If you’ve provided a mobile phone number as a contact number for your company, we will also send you text reminders.How much time to put aside to complete an annual returnOn average, it takes 10 minutes or less to complete an annual return. We encourage you to do it as soon as you receive your first reminder, so you can get back to doing business.Read our guides on annual returnsRemember your RealMe® login detailsMake sure you remember the username and password you used when you first logged into the Companies Register.
