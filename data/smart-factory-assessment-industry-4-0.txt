Their dedicated teams are forever seeking out the latest tech and improved processes to find efficiencies and cost saving measures.Often the biggest challenge they face is benchmarking; truly understanding how well they’re doing versus others, and having the right information to inform future decisions.The Smart Factory Assessment was set up to overcome this hurdle and help manufacturers continue to evolve and develop, and deliver even better products and services to their customers.The assessments are based around the Smart Industry Readiness Index (SIRI), a globally recognised set of tools, frameworks and metrics, developed specifically to support manufacturers at the cutting edge of new tech.You’ll start with an educational session, teaching and refreshing your team about key Industry 4.0 concepts, principles and terminology, as well as discussing your future aspirations.The following day you’ll accompany your assessor around your factory as they score you against the 16 point framework, identifying your strengths and weaknesses. In the days following you’ll virtually reconvene to go through your results and suggested areas of improvement which will have the biggest positive impact.With your roadmap in place, you and your team can set to work, creating a better product and a more sustainable and profitable business.What is SIRI?The Smart Industry Readiness Index (SIRI) is an internationally recognised standard for Industry 4.0 transformation. It was created by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in partnership with a network of leading technology companies, consultancy firms, and industry and academic experts.  SIRI comprises a suite of frameworks and tools to help manufacturers – regardless of size and industry – start, scale, and sustain their manufacturing transformation journeys. SIRI covers the three core elements of Industry 4.0: Process, Technology, and Organisation.Visit WebsiteWhat is Industry 4.0?Industry 4.0 - also referred to as the fourth Industrial Revolution - is a broad term for the new technologies and data - such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence -  that are revolutionising the worlds of manufacturing and distribution. Callaghan Innovation’s experts are here to help you cut through the technology hype, reinvent your business model and find genuine value and growth.Read MoreBenefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2An internationally recognised standardAssessments conducted using a suite of tools and frameworks, created by an internationally recognised body.Fill 1 Copy 2Benchmark against industryLearn how well you’re doing versus other organisations in your industry, and the wider manufacturing sector.Fill 1 Copy 2Identify future opportunitiesWalk away with a roadmap detailing fruitful future opportunities.Fill 1 Copy 2Free-of-chargeReceive a zero-cost voucher if you’re selected.Success storiesIndependent DoorsSmart Factory Assessment: Industry 4.0 |  Independent Doors Case StudyTranscript[Paul Harris]We're located in Christ Church, Timaru, and Cromwell. So, covering essentially from Kaikōura South in the South Island. We're about 56 people across those three locations, so small to medium business. We list and produce across the three locations, about 800 pre-hung doors a week. So, we attended a Smart Factory showcase. Fantastic, sort of invigorated us from a learning perspective and wanting to jump on board the journey of progression and continuous improvement. So, post that, we applied for a SIRI assessment of our own which we're lucky enough to be to be granted. We wanted to get a baseline of where we're at, and we wanted to get a road map of how we could progress. [Chris Maguire]The Smart Factory Assessment was very informative. What I found was I was actually quite surprised at how far things had come in the last probably 10 to 15 years in the industry. I've been in the industry for about 30 years, so I found it very informative. The options that were given as far as technology going forward and innovation. [Paul Harris]Three key things we've changed post the assessment have been how we communicate across the business, working on our system integration and getting a roadmap to automation. [Chris Maguire]I think it's the way forward, and even just the small changes we've made initially, we can see the massive difference it's making and that is going to make. So, for me it's a no brainer, I mean technology is the way forward. [Paul Harris]100% recommend any manufacturer going through the SIRI assessment and you know I'm 100% advocate of the of the program. Be vulnerable you know, you get yourself a baseline and you get yourself a road map to improvement.ArgusSmart Factory Assessment: Industry 4.0 | Argus Case StudyTranscript[Nathan Hay]I'm Nathan hay and I'm the general manager for Argus Manutech. Argus is a medium to large business, so we've got about 150 staff at the moment. Argus Heating manufacturers a wide variety of products for the Argus heating OEM industrial range, such as foil heaters that go in bulk containers, and also the Argus Cabletech range of products, which is contract manufacturing services such as electronic boxes and customised wiring harnesses. So, we heard about SIRI originally looking on the internet, but the Callaghan Industry 4 Demonstration Network was our first foray into it, and we had a demonstration on site with robotics, which was pretty cool. [David Lee]Since the SIRI assessment, we realised that we had a lot of lag measures. It was kind of insightful to see where our weaknesses are compared to some of the international benchmarks. With the SIRI assessment, we then moved towards more of a digital manufacturing scenario and we got TV screens in and we're able to highlight critical parts and critical issues in real time, and address them accordingly. [Nathan Hay]So, the biggest value for us was providing a practical roadmap and also practical examples. The networking with other manufacturers that opened up for us was next level, yeah so really beneficial. [David Lee]What we've learned from the SIRI assessment is that there are quick and easy things you can implement to really boost yourself back into being competitive worldwide, and the SIRI assessment helped us prove that. And we've been able to effectively create positive change and positive results. [Nathan Hay]I think if you look at our metrics over the last 6 months, they have gone through the roof. So, we are more efficient, we are a much better team and inclusive, it's- yeah, it's really been a game changer for us.Is this right for me?EligibilityApplications are now open for a free assessment. To be eligible, you must have under 150 full time employees and be willing to put forward three relevant senior leaders to be involved with the assessment.On a quarterly basis 25 businesses will be selected from the applicants.
