The type of help available depends on this classification.Read how MPI classifies events Assistance for localised adverse eventsEvery year there are disruptive weather systems or localised adverse events that affect a relatively small number of farms. Communities should first organise a response with local government and their local Rural Support Trust. Families severely affected may qualify for central government support, like tax relief or Working for Families assistance.For information about tax relief, contact your tax agent or Inland Revenue's emergency helpline on 0800 47 35 66For questions about Working for Families call 0800 22 77 73visit the IRD website Assistance for medium-and large-scale eventsIn addition to the support for localised events, more help is available for rural communities and individuals affected by medium- and large-scale events.Depending on the adverse event, rural communities and individuals may be able to access:Inland Revenue assistance: Several tax relief measures are available on a case-by-case basis. These are flexible tax provisions or late estimates of provisional tax and use of the adverse events income equalisation scheme.Rural assistance payments (RAPs): Payments to families affected by specific events when their farm or orchard business can't meet essential living needs. These payments are set at 100% of the unemployment benefit level.Recovery facilitator(s): The government may appoint a recovery facilitator. The facilitator's main role is to coordinate the response and recovery initiatives. A facilitator is necessary when administering RAPs.Emergency unemployment benefits (through Working for Families): This is available for employees who have no work and income for a short period. Income and asset tests apply.Special needs grants (Recoverable Assistance Programme from Working for Families): This is usually to meet a one-off need (for example, a food grant) and is discretionary, based on individual circumstances.Psychosocial support: Psychosocial support – like counselling – can be made available through a Rural Support Trust.Pastoral care: Grants to help pastoral care providers support primary producers. Support includes financial advice, counselling, and welfare support through a Rural Support Trust.Enhanced Task Force Green: This is a labour assistance scheme that provides assistance for clean up and repairs. The enhancements may include assistance for personal safety equipment and machinery.Technology transfer costs: Grants to provide assistance for education and technical advice on recovery options relating to financial and contingency planning, including animal welfare. The grants can be used for activities including workshops, meetings and brochures. Contact MPI if you need support for technology transfer during or following a medium- or large-scale adverse event.Volunteer costs: Costs are met for volunteer travel and accommodation from outside the region.ContactsInland RevenueContact your tax agent or Inland Revenue's emergency helpline, 0800 47 35 66.Working for FamiliesCall 0800 22 77 73Visit the IRD website Rural Support TrustsCall 0800 78 72 54 (0800 RURAL HELP)Visit the Rural Support Trusts' website FirstMate NZCall 0800 ADRIFT (0800 237 438)Visit FirstMate NZ FeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
