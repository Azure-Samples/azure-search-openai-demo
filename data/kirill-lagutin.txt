In my day-to-day job I focus on supporting multiple clients and partners using my knowledge of lipid chemistry and analytical methods. This includes advanced analysis of unusual lipids in algae and bacteria, development and validation of new analytical methods to aid a development of new marine oils, like Greenshell mussel oil, or presenting the latest developments in the area of bioactive lipids in milks to industry representatives to assist with the development of new generation infant formulas.My long-standing interest in food fraud prevention has led me to develop food authenticity tools, contributing to the protection of unique NZ products on international markets as well as protecting NZ consumers from fraudulent products.As an experienced Quality Manager I lead Callaghan Innovation’s Lipid Analytical Services which provides ISO 17025 accredited analysis of dairy phospholipids using NMR. I develop and support tailored Quality Management Systems ensuring the highest standards of quality and compliance.BackAreas of expertiseFood authenticity and fraud preventionLipid analysis (dairy, marine, bacteria, etc)Structure elucidationMethod developmentQuality managementEducationPhD Bioorganic chemistry, 2013Memberships and awardsMember of the American Oil Chemists' Society (AOCS)Member of the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology (NZIFST)Committee member of the AOCS Australasian sectionSelected publicationsHPLC-MS, GC and NMR profiling of bioactive lipids of human milk and milk of dairy animals (cow, sheep, goat, buffalo, camel, red deer), Lagutin, K., Mackenzie, A., Bloor, S., Scott, D.,Vyssotski, M., Separations, 2012, 9(6), p.145. Absolute stereochemistry of 1,2-diols from lipids of Thermomicrobia, Lagutin, K., Wong, H., Vyssotski, M. and MacKenzie, A., Lipids, 2016, 51(3), pp.373-376. Efficient separation and analysis of triacylglycerols: Quantitation of β-palmitate (OPO) in oils and infant formulas, Vyssotski, M., Bloor, S.J., Lagutin, K., Wong, H. and Williams, D.B.G., Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, 2015, 63(26), pp.5985-5992. A novel fatty acid, 12, 17-dimethyloctadecanoic acid, from the extremophile Thermogemmatispora sp.(strain T81), Vyssotski, M., Ryan, J., Lagutin, K., Wong, H., Morgan, X. and Stott, M., Lipids, 2012, 47(6), pp.601-611. Chthonomonas calidirosea gen. nov., sp. nov., an aerobic, pigmented, thermophilic micro-organism of a novel bacterial class, Chthonomonadetes classis nov., of the newly described phylum Armatimonadetes originally designated candidate division OP10.
