A distribution can take the form of a cash payment (a dividend) or shares instead of a dividend.Satisfying the solvency testA company can authorise a distribution at any time and for any amount, but directors must:be satisfied that the company will be able to satisfy the solvency test after the distribution is made, andensure the distribution doesn't breach any provision in the company's constitution, or section 53 of the Companies Act 1993.                                                             Companies Act 1993 - section 53                                                                New Zealand Legislation                                        A company satisfies the solvency test if, after the distribution is made:it's able to pay its debts as they become due, andthe value of its assets is greater than the value of its liabilities, including contingent liabilities.In approving a distribution to shareholders, directors must sign a certificate confirming that, in their opinion, the company can satisfy the solvency test and explain why they've formed that opinion.Note        The definition of solvency changed in 2014. The version in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 is now obsolete.    If a company becomes insolventIf it is later apparent that the company should not have made the distribution, as it could not satisfy the solvency test, the company can ask shareholders to repay the distribution.If the company goes into liquidation after the distribution has been made, a liquidator may also demand repayment.Note        Seek legal advice if you're uncertain about your rights and obligations as a shareholder.
