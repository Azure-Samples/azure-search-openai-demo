Over the last few years at Callaghan Innovation I've been fortunate to play key roles in steering our waka (canoe) towards ever more ambitious innovation-driven horizons.My journey began with a seat at the Callaghan Innovation Board for three rewarding years. This experience laid the foundation for my transition to the executive leadership team where I became Chief Product Officer in 2021. A significant part of my personal history has been characterised by the launch and nurturing of successful business ventures, which are now operating across Australia, the US, and Europe. This hands-on experience in the startup and scale-up world has helped build my entrepreneurial spirit and instinct which I am bringing to my current role as well.Prior to Callaghan Innovation, I held the position of CEO at Creative HQ, where I helped orchestrate the launch of accelerators that have nurtured startups, GovTech initiatives, and corporate ventures. I've also championed inclusive innovation programs like Korero Matauranga and Lightning Lab XX which have enriched New Zealand's education and innovation landscape.During my academic journey I have completed a PhD in Neural Networks/Artificial Intelligence and an MBA in International Business. I have also authored a range of books on early-stage venture development and parenting for dads. I'm excited about the vast opportunities the discipline of innovation offers to both the private and public sector and I am committed to leading Callaghan Innovation towards a future marked by groundbreaking advancements, transformative growth and achieving Sir Paul Callaghan’s vision of 100 companies that will turn New Zealand around.BackAreas of expertiseOrganisational strategyCo-design, collaborative work and design thinking Digital assets and commerceRevenue management and operational efficiencyStakeholder managementBehavioural psychologyAI/ neural networksSystems thinkingEducationMBA, International Business, dual degree: GSBA Zurich/ SUNY Albany, 2002PhD, Artificial Intelligence, Glasgow Caledonian University, 1999MEng, Computer Science, University of Technology Esslingen/ Glasgow Caledonian UniversityMemberships and awardsNorth & South Magazine’s New Zealander of the Year 2010, for innovation in parenting education.ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
