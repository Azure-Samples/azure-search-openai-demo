My expertise lies in computer-aided engineering, fluid-related machinery and manufacturing.I began my career as an R&D engineer at Hamilton Jet and later as a plastic injection mould designer and NC programmer for the motor trade industry. Working in industrial design enhanced my consultancy skills and led to working with many New Zealand manufacturers. I joined Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) where I led a significant research program in cryogenic refrigeration involving the development and commercialisation of a novel refrigerator technology.Since the successful transfer of cryogenic refrigeration technology to industry (Fabrum), I have been providing CFD and computational engineering services as part of Callaghan Innovation's Engineering team. Bob Buckley is an inspiring leader who played a significant role in my professional development. He led the superconductivity team at IRL that is now the Robinson Research institute. I am a member of the Cryogenic Society of America and have published in the fields of cryogenics, materials and superconductivity. Additionally, I have been associated with Callaghan Innovation projects such as Cool Runnings, Ocean Max and Cold Roads Ahead.BackAreas of expertiseMechanical engineering calculation and designFluid and thermodynamic systemsComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)Computational engineering and modellingCryogenic refrigerationEducationPhD - Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury, 2016Memberships and awardsCryogenic Society of AmericaSelected publicationsCFD analysis of a diaphragm free-piston Stirling cryocooler, A.
