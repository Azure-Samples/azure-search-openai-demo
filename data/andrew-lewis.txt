Renowned as a quantitative NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) expert, I have initiated and managed cutting-edge magnetic resonance facilities across both Canada and New Zealand. During my time I’ve guided hundreds of scientists and businesses through the art of NMR spectrometry.My skill lies in discovering novel applications for NMR to tackle intricate challenges. Among my proudest accomplishments is bringing the first NMR FoodScreener to the Southern Hemisphere. I'm also delighted to have established two of New Zealand's most sensitive NMR spectrometer systems here at Callaghan Innovation.The multidisciplinary prowess of NMR means we are using it to extract chemical fingerprints from samples that can unveil the geographic and botanical origins of diverse substances, be it food, beverages, medicines, or chemicals. I stand on the shoulders of giants like Sir Paul Callaghan, whose belief in people's potential to dream big and think outside the box aligns with my personal mission. BackAreas of expertiseQuantitative NMR (qNMR)Chemical Structure ElucidationAuthenticity and Provenance of Food and BeveragesMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)Purity and Concentration of Active Pharmaceutical IngredientsKinetic Isotope Effects (KIE)EducationAdjunct Professor, Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Canada, since 2005Adjunct Research Fellow, The Ferrier Research Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, since 2017Entrepreneurial Skills Training Programme, British Columbia Institute of Technology, Canada, 2003PhD, Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Canada, 1998MSc (hons), Chemistry, University of Auckland, 1991BSc, Chemistry, University of Auckland, 1989Memberships and awardsSir Edmund Hillary Award, Callaghan Innovation, 2018Staff Achievement Award for Innovation, Simon Fraser University, 2012Australian and New Zealand Society for Magnetic Resonance (ANZMAG)Association of Managers of Magnetic Resonance Laboratories (AMMRL)Committee for qNMR, ValidNMR.orgNew Zealand Institute of Food Science and TechnologySelected publicationsAdvances in Instrumental Analysis of Dairy Products.
