The new funding will help accelerate global expansion. The company’s products are stocked in supermarkets and grocery chains across New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.Visit websiteCloseBlis Technologies | HealthtechEndless sore throats as a child prompted Dunedin-based microbiologist John Tagg to research a preventive solution that was to become the world’s first probiotic for oral health. While probiotics are well known for supporting gut health, they are less known for their role in defending against bad bacteria in the mouth. Tagg’s research led to the discovery of a probiotic that prevents strep throat by inhibiting the growth of those bad bacteria.Blis Technologies launched its first product in 2002 and has worked closely with Callaghan Innovation scientists throughout its development. Blis Technologies is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and posted revenue for the first half of Financial Year 2023 at $2.3 million, up 29 percent on the same period last year.Blis Technologies has a range of products on the market for teeth, gums and oral health care and has also diversified into offering probiotics for skin health, again assisted by Callaghan Innovation.Visit websiteCloseCetogenix | Climate TechCetogenix is a climate-tech startup developing technologies that enable the transition from fossil resources to genuinely renewable resources.

The potential benefits of its work are already causing a stir, and the company has recently received a $2.7 million grant to develop a biosensor that will detect human diseases like TB and malaria.Visit websiteCloseSharesies | FintechMention Sharesies to most New Zealanders, and they’ll nod in recognition. It’s a mark of how far the company has come since 2017, when the initial conversations that led to Sharesies took place. A wealth-development platform based around the insight that not everyone wanted, or was able to invest huge amounts of money, Sharesies aims to empower people by giving them the same opportunities regardless of whether they have $5 or $5 million to invest.Sharesies’ vision meant tackling accessibility by building an online investment platform and helping newbies feel more confident about investing by making education an integral part of its platform.The company’s six co-founders received support from Callaghan Innovation, amongst others, on their journey to creating financial empowerment for everyone. The agency provided Project and Experience Grants as well as tax credits for research and development through the RDTI scheme.Visit websiteCloseTechion | AgritechGreg Mirams’ farming roots led him to pioneer FECPAKG2 – a world-first online integrated digital diagnostic platform for the livestock industry.
