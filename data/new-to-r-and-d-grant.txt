They’ve formed a business around an exciting new idea or concept, are looking for some initial research and development (R&D) funding, and would benefit from starting their own in-house R&D to put them on the path towards commercial success. The grant comes in two parts, which work in parallel. If you apply, you'll put forward a proposed plan and budget for your first structured R&D project, to push forward your new idea or concept. This first R&D project often has the steepest learning curve and the most exciting, future defining outputs, and provides vital hands-on experience to use for many years to come.Alongside the first project, you will also receive funding to build R&D skills and capabilities within your business. Our scientists, engineers and R&D experts have identified six areas of essential skills and capabilities that innovators should possess to become long term R&D performers. You’ll choose learning activities that are most likely to fill skill gaps, directly impact the progress of your idea and enhance your R&D project.Like many other government grants, recipients will need to secure co-funding. For every dollar spent by a recipient, 40 cents come from Callaghan Innovation, and the other 60 cents come from their own funds, or via private investment. The co-funding supports a maximum total combined costs of $1m (40% - $400,000), covering both skills and capability building and R&D project costs.Your business is unique, so your R&D should be unique too. All of this new and unique knowledge has a positive impact on the innovation ecosystem, which in turn plays a vital role in driving economic growth and future prosperity in Aotearoa New Zealand.We know R&D can be uncertain and there’s no guarantee of yielding the results you want. But with that initial groundwork done - your ducks in a row - you can feel more confident that you’ll get to the right outcome as fast as possible, for all of your future R&D activities.Benefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2Kickstart your first R&D projectReceive vital funding to start your first structured R&D project.Fill 1 Copy 2Lay foundations for long-term R&DEquip your team with a set of skills and knowledge needed to undertake effective R&D for years to come.Fill 1 Copy 2Decrease future R&D risksUndertake R&D activities more efficiently, and reduce risks of misspent time and money.Fill 1 Copy 2Set up for future funding and supportOpen the doors to future R&D funding, including the R&D Tax Incentive.Capability developmentThere are six areas of skills and capability development that our scientists, engineers and R&D experts identified as most beneficial to businesses starting out on their R&D journeys.To receive funding, you’ll need to conduct activities from between two and six of the categories. This could be training courses, workshops, internal assessments and other forms of learning. Some of these activities are products and services that Callaghan Innovation offers, others are delivered by partners or other organisations.Additionally, you’ll take part in an introductory session with our R&D Tax Incentive Engagement team.  Read more below.PrevNext1 / 61 - Customer Input into R&DLearn how to understand your target customers and how to develop products and services that they want.read more2 - Intellectual PropertyUnderstanding the importance of the intellectual property around your innovation and how to protect it for years to come.read more3 - Regulatory & ComplianceUnderstanding the regulatory and compliance landscape, and how it will inform your R&D and final product.read more4 - Lean R&D Best PracticeLearn how to operate your R&D projects, and eventually manufacturing processes, in an efficient manner.read more5 - Project ManagementLearn project management skills that help you plan, prioritise and manage the tasks within your R&D project, and meet deadlines and budgets.read more6 - R&D Information ManagementUnderstanding how to increase efficiency and effectiveness of your research through data management.read moreWhat is R&D?Research and development is so much more than just giving something a go to see if it works. If what you're doing ticks these three boxes, we recognise it as R&D.Your activity seeks to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty: a competent professional in the field is unable to answer your question.Your activity seeks to create new knowledge, or new or improved processes, services or goods: you're seeking something that doesn't yet exist in the world.Your activity follows a systematic approach: working with a plan, in a thorough and efficient manner.Ready for the R&D Tax IncentiveWith your newly found R&D capabilities, skills and knowledge, and your first R&D project underway, it’s highly likely that your business will become eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive (RDTI): a 15% tax credit that can be claimed annually against eligible R&D expenditure. Since its launch, the RDTI has provided over $300m in credits, and supported over $2bn of R&D investment.An introductory session with the RDTI Engagement team will help you understand all the eligibility criteria, ensure you’re collecting the right information throughout the year and lend a guiding hand as you progress towards filing your application.Find out more about the R&D Tax Incentive.How the funding worksThe grant will fund 40% of your eligible R&D activities and Capability Development building, up to the maximum total of $400,000. This means for every dollar spent by a recipient, 40 cents come from Callaghan Innovation, and the other 60 cents come from their own funds, or via private investment. As part of the funding agreement, you will be required to conduct activities from between two and six different Skills and Capability Development categories (above). You’ll need to provide the details of your chosen Capability Development activities as part of your application. Additionally you’ll need to demonstrate how your chosen capability development will build knowledge in the business, and the impact it will have on driving long-term R&D performance.Your capability development activities should comprise no less than 5% of the total grant funding.  Example (broken down below) : Your costs are $1,000,000. You will receive $400,000 total in co-funding, requiring you to fund the remaining $600,000. Example:ActivityCosts40% funded by Callaghan InnovationSkills and capability development: Intellectual Property training$30,000$12,000Skills and capability development: Regulatory & Compliance training$20,000$8,000Skills and capability development: Project Management$50,000$20,000Your chosen R&D activities$900,000$360,000Total$1,000,000$400,000Is this right for me?EligibilityAs the grant is specially designed for those new to R&D, applicants who have previously invested in R&D or applied for other government R&D funding are not eligible.As a first step, your business must: Your business is an eligible entityYour business must not have received any government funding for R&D greater than $5,000 in the three years prior to the date of submission of your applicationYour business must have spent less than $50,000 in total on R&D over the three years prior to the date of submission of your applicationYou must be able to fund your share of the R&D costsYou can read the full eligibility criteria on the New to R&D Resource Hub.You'll be asked to provide evidence for your 60% share of the co-funding.
