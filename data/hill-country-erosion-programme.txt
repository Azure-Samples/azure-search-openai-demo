Programme for councilsThe Hill Country Erosion Programme (HCE) helps protect erosion-prone hill country. It provides leadership and targeted support to regional councils and unitary authorities. Find out how the programme works and why it's needed.On this page:About the Hill Country Erosion ProgrammeCase studies of funded workHill Country Erosion Programmes in your regionAbout the Hill Country Erosion (HCE) ProgrammeThe HCE Programme is a partnership between the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), councils and landowners. It provides funding support in 4-year blocks to regional erosion-control projects that are beyond the capacity of councils to address on their own. Both councils and landowners also provide funding throughout the 4-year programmes.The government has allocated $25 million to 14 regional erosion control programmes for 4 years beginning in July 2023. The funding helps protect over 21,000 hectares of erosion-prone farmland. It will continue to support several well-established regional erosion control programmes, and start new programmes in other regions.The HCE Programme supports councils to:work with landowners in mapping and identifying erosion-prone landdeliver catchment initiatives and sustainable land management projectsbuild their technical capacity to deliver erosion-control work.It also supports councils to plan for and treat erosion-prone land, usually with trees as the main treatment, through:space planting of trees (far enough apart that pasture can grow between them for grazing stock)land retirement and reversion to native vegetative coverforestry.Loss of productive land through erosion has a significant impact on the environment, and the economy. Erosion and its effects in hill country areas alone are estimated to cost New Zealand's economy $100 million to $150 million a year. Reducing erosion in the upper areas of a catchment costs less than the cost of flooding and of flood-control structures in the lower areas.Case studies of funded workRural communities are the kaitiaki (guardians) of much of our nation's precious land and water. The HCE Programme supports farmers to make good land decisions, helping:retain productive soilsreduce sediment loss to waterways. Right across our regions, the HCE Programme is working to give landowners the support, advice and incentives they need.
