My 25 year research career is focused on materials design, fabrication, and characterisation, moving novel research through to commercialisation. I have a proven track record of successfully transforming concepts into prototypes and commercial products.For the past 7 years, my primary research focus has been on Additive Manufacturing (AM) of complex parts using cutting-edge 3D printing technologies such as Digital Light Processing, Cold Metal Fusion, and Extrusion Printing. This has allowed me to lead technical advancements and establish in-house capabilities for shaping functional metal and ceramic components.I am passionate about developing innovative processes that can convert raw materials and industrial waste into high-value products. For this, I work closely with Callaghan Innovation’s customers in ongoing product development which will support the circular economy.BackAreas of expertiseAdditive Manufacturing of metals and ceramicsPowder processing and characterisationShaping of metals and ceramicsThin and thick film coatingsThermal process optimizationPhysical and mechanical property testing of advanced materialsInorganic and metallic catalystsEducationMSc National College of Industrial Ceramics, Limoges, France, 1997ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
