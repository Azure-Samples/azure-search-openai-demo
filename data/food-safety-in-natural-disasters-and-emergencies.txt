disasters and adverse events (like floods, storms, power cuts, and earthquakes) can affect your access to clean water and electricity. Find out how to protect yourself from foodborne illness during and after these events.Keep food and water safeDuring an emergency:fridges, freezers, and ovens may break down, and food could spoil more quicklywater supplies could get cut off or get pollutedsewerage systems could get disrupted.To avoid getting sick from food during emergencies:eat foods that will expire soon first – for example, bread and meat because they spoil more quickly than non-perishable foodeat canned foods lastopen the fridge and freezer as little as possible to help keep it cooler for longerdo not eat vegetables or fruits that have been lying in flood watercover all food with plastic wrap, or store in waterproof containersleave bottles, drink cans, and water containers in the fridge (if it's working) to keep things coldthrow out bad or rotting food before it spoils other food. Food safety in the home after flooding – Fact sheet  [PDF, 1.3 MB] Food safety advice for homekilled meat after a natural disaster – Fact sheet  [PDF, 1.4 MB]Focus on hygiene when preparing and cooking foodMaintaining hygiene around food preparation and cooking requires more thought than normal.Always wash and dry your hands before preparing food – if water is in short supply, keep some in a bowl with disinfectant.Ensure all kitchen utensils and food preparation surfaces are clean before use.Cook food thoroughly.Cover all food with plastic wrap or store in waterproof containers.Rubbish containing food scraps must be protected from flies and rats by wrapping the scraps or putting them in a sealed container.How to use clean water and keep it safe and cleanTo cook, wash dishes, and wash your hands, you can use water from:a hot water cylindera toilet cistern – as long as no chemical toilet cleaner is presenta spa/swimming pool – they can be used to wash yourself and your family.You can also use bottled water.Boil or purify water before using it in food preparation. This helps to avoid spreading viruses and bacteria between food. Once boiled, cover and store food in a clean container and place in the fridge (if it's working) or in some other cool place. Re-boil the water if it is not used within 24 hours.If you do not have power to boil water, then purifying tablets or bleach can be added to ensure its safety. Add 5 drops of household bleach per litre of water (or half a teaspoon for 10 litres) and leave for 30 minutes. Do not use bleaches that contain added scent or perfume, surfactants, or other additives – they can make people sick.After an emergency, make sure food is safeKnowing what is safe to eat during the "clean-up" phase after an emergency can become a guessing game. Understand what may or may not be safe to eat.Check the food – does it smell or look different? Has the colour changed and does it have a slimy texture? If so, it's probably unsafe to eat.If food is still visibly frozen (for example, it still has ice crystals on it), and packaging isn't damaged or open, you can still safely refreeze it.You should not refreeze food that has defrosted.You can still keep or use food that was frozen but has defrosted, you just need to keep it cold (like in the fridge).Do not use any tinned food that has been damaged (for example, if the can has broken open, become deeply dented, or is heavily rusted).You should always be prepared for a disaster. If you follow the guidelines above, they may help prevent you or your family from becoming ill.Food safety is just one step in staying safe during and after an emergency. Civil Defence has more information on what to do in an emergency.Civil Defence Prepare a survival kit for next timeThere are many things you can do to minimise the impact on your health before disaster strikes.
