I love working with so many talented people across our organisation, all of whom are motivated by helping to support the growth of innovative new deep tech businesses. And always with the ultimate focus of enhancing Aotearoa for all of us.Having the opportunity to work closely as part of the Measurement Standards Laboratory of NZ, while new purpose-built laboratories were designed and constructed to house NZ’s Time, Electrical, Temperature and Humidity standards, has been a highlight at Callaghan Innovation.I’m really fortunate to have worked in a range of different industries, always with fantastic people delivering great results. Not least of which was my time in policing. I have huge respect for the individuals that work in our emergency services and I feel fortunate to have that background in my work experience. You can probably tell I like working in areas that have a ‘greater good’ purpose. Callaghan Innovation very definitely ticks that box.BackAreas of expertisePeople LeadershipBusiness PlanningCommunicationInvestigation Skills (information gathering and analysis)Problem SolvingStakeholder ManagementBuilding high performing customer focused teamsConflict ResolutionEducationBachelor of Arts, University of OtagoDiploma New Zealand Policing, Royal New Zealand Police CollegeArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
