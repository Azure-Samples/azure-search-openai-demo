We support Kiwi innovators in effectively engaging with the R&D Tax Incentive programme and are here to answer your questions and provide you support along the way.I’m a scientist myself, and previously worked as a Technical Support Manager within the Applied Technologies team at Callaghan Innovation. My role was to help Kiwis solve technical challenges on their R&D journey, by connecting innovators with our world-leading Callaghan Innovation experts, scientists and engineers. Now, rather than helping innovators to overcome their scientific and technical challenges, I’m helping them overcome some of the commercial challenges, and helping to ease some of the financial strain of developing new and exciting products and services.I have learned never to be surprised because innovators are everywhere. My team is fortunate to talk to inspiring people every day with amazing new ideas.BackAreas of expertiseProject ManagementStrategic PlanningBusiness DevelopmentOptical EngineeringUltrafast laser technologyNonlinear opticsEducationPhD in Physics from Victoria University (2020)BSc.
