My expertise is in polymer/material characterisation to link the role of chemistry and structure to properties as suited for given applications. We have developed and characterised materials such as water absorptive polymers, functional polymers and natural polymers for a variety of applications in the fields of technical/medical textiles and engineered textile/polymer composites.I have interest in solving industrial problems related to polymer/material synthesis and characterisation to match with the desired application. My experience with extraction of nanocellulose and biomass-derived carbon fibers, electrospinning nanofibers combines with textile/garment design and manufacturing to deliver bespoke material solutions for industries. BackAreas of expertisePolymer and material analysis for bespoke applicationsPolymer/textiles recycling and upcycling strategiesTriboelectric nanogenerators/wearable electronicsBespoke composite design for different applicationsCellulose nanomaterial extraction and characterization methodsNew textile fibre design and manufacturing strategiesElectrospinning nanofibers for bespoke applicationsEducationPhD, Polymer Science, Case Western Reserve University-USA, 2014 Memberships and awardsPresident's Award for Scientific Research - 2023Outstanding Research Award with Distinction (by University of Moratuwa) - 2020Gold Medal for Best Performance in Textile Engineering (by University of Moratuwa) - 2007Selected publicationsNethmi SL Dissanayake, Maadri A Pathirana, Nandula D.
