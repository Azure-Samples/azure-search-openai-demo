youth clientsStop your paymentsStop your childcare paymentsPayment cardsDebtChildcareHaving another childArrest warrantsYour rights and responsibilitiesMoney management for Youth clientsWhen you are working with a Youth Service provider, your payments may be subject to money management Money mangement means your provider will help you manage your payments so that all your important costs are paid. This means:your rent or board and things like your power bill and any debts will be paid straight from your payment. You won't get this money yourself.you will get paid a weekly allowance of up to $50 into your personal bank account.any money left over will be put onto your personal payment card. This is like a debit card that you can use to buy your food and groceries at approved stores. Payment cardsMoney Management and Extra HelpThe following will be paid directly to your bank account:Disability AllowanceChild Disability AllowanceUnsupported Child's BenefitOrphan's BenefitTraining Incentive Allowance - weekly ongoing costs. The following will be subject to money management:Temporary Additional SupportFamily Tax CreditAccommodation Supplement For example, an 18 year old sole parent with a one year old disabled child, renting in Kaitaia, would have their money managed as follows:For more detail see our:Manuals and procedures (MAP) - Young Parent PaymentManuals and procedures (MAP) - Youth PaymentIf you are new to Youth Service, your provider will set this up for you when you meet with them. They will set up the payment of your rent and bills with you and give you a payment card.You can manage your whole payment yourself if you show your Youth Service provider that you can do this responsibly. You should talk to them about how you can prove this.Once you have proven you are capable of managing your money yourself, your payment will go straight into your bank account and you will be responsible for paying all of your own costs.Incentives and Money ManagementIf you are doing all the things you need to with your education, training or work-based learning, budgeting and parenting you can get extra incentive payments.If you are subject to money management, extra incentive payments will be added to the total amount that goes through money management. If you are not subject to money management and you earn an incentive payment, this will be paid straight to your bank account.When you have been successfully in education, training or work-based learning for 6 months you can get an extra $10 a week.If you finish a budgeting programme and have regular budget talks with your Youth Service provider for 3 months, you can get an extra $10 a week.If you are receiving Young Parent Payment, you can get a further $10 a week if you have met all your parenting requirements and had regular talks with your Youth Service provider for three months.This includes:completing an approved parenting programmeenrolling your child with a health practitioner and keeping up to date with WellChild checksregistering your child in an approved early childhood education programme or other suitable childcare while you are in education, training or work-based learning or part-time work. Incentive payments are earned by each person separately. For example, if only one parent attends a parenting programme only they can get the extra payment. If both parents go, both can get the payment.Once you are getting the extra payment you need to keep up the good work.If you are away from education, training or work-based learning without a good reason, or don't complete the required course work, or you get suspended, you will lose the education incentive payment.If you get into trouble with your money and are not managing it properly you will lose the budgeting incentive payment.If your child is not being well looked after, you will lose the parenting incentive payment.Your provider must tell Work and Income if you have stopped doing what you need to do to get your incentive payments.Sanctions and money managementIf you are on Youth Payment, a first or second failure to meet your obligations results in the in-hand allowance and any incentive payments being suspended. If you don't recomply within 4 weeks your payment will be automatically cancelled and you will have to reapply. A third failure will result in Youth Payment, Temporary Additional Support, Accommodation Supplement and any incentive payments being cancelled immediately. Disability Allowance can continue to be paid if you still meet the eligibility criteria for it.If you receive Young Parent Payment (YPP) a first or second sanction means your in hand allowance and any incentive payments are suspended until you recomply. For a third failure, 50% of your YPP is cancelled, but you can continue to receive the full rate of Accommodation Supplement and Temporary Additional Support. For couples, these payments are reduced by half and paid to the non-sanctioned partner. Disability Allowance, Child Disability Allowance, Guaranteed Childcare Assistance Payment & Childcare Assistance can continue to be paid if you continue to meet the eligibility criteria for these forms of assistance.For more detail see:Young Parent Payments (MAP)Youth Payments (MAP)Young Parent Payment Obligations (MAP)Youth Payment Obligations (MAP)Young Parent Sanctions (MAP)Youth Payment Sanctions (MAP)ContactIf you need to more information contact your Youth Service provider if you have one, otherwise contact usHow we can helpBenefits and paymentsWorkOn a benefitHousingOnline servicesCheck what you might getFind workApply onlineMyMSDHow to stay safe onlineAboutAbout Work and IncomeAbout this siteAccessibilityPrivacy, disclaimer and copyrightContact usPhone numbers                    Find a service centre                    Facebook                    Twitter                    Feedback                              Help in other languages        Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa /
