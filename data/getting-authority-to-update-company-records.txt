This is explained below.Who can request confirmation of their authorityIf you’re a director or an authorised person acting for the company you can ask us to confirm your authority using our online services. You will need:a RealMe® loginan online services account with the Companies Register.

Using the company keyIf a company was incorporated before June 2010, it may have a company key. If so, you can use this key to confirm authority instantly. If you've forgotten your company key, you will be directed to our automated service to retrieve it.2. Asking an existing authority holder to confirm your authorityAnother director or authorised person may already have authority and they can confirm your authority. Select a name from the drop-down menu and we will send them an email asking them to accept or reject your request. Please note that it may take some time for you to confirm authority using this option as it relies on the authority holder manually responding to your request.3. Using ID verification, such as your driver licence or passportTo use this service, you’ll need to provide your New Zealand driver licence or passport details.If the name on the ID matches your name in the company’s director records, your authority will be confirmed immediately.If the name on your ID does not match your name on the company’s director records, you will need to confirm authority by providing a letter of authorisation which is signed by yourself — Form CR-LOA Letter of authorisation template [PDF, 119 KB].Once this is approved, you can log into the register and amend your name, so that it matches the name on your ID.If you don't have a NZ driver licence or passport, you can upload a copy of another evidence document. This will take longer to be confirmed.The options available if you're an authorised personIf you are an authorised person, first select whether you are acting as an individual, or as part of an organisation. Then choose one of the following ways to confirm authority.Only the options available to you will be displayed1. Using the company keyIf a company was incorporated before June 2010, it may have a company key. If so, you can use the key to confirm authority instantly. If you've forgotten your company key, you will be directed to our automated service to retrieve it.2. Asking a director to confirm your authorityA director of the company may already have authority and they can confirm your authority. Select a name from the drop-down menu and we'll send them an email asking them to accept or reject your request. Please note that it may take some time to confirm authority using this option as it relies on that director manually responding to your request. This option is only available when a director is set up to take these requests.3. Using the director ID verification serviceTo use this service, you’ll need to select a director of the company and provide New Zealand driver licence or passport details that match the details held on the register for that director.        You need to make sure that the driver licence or passport has not expired. A driver licence must be the latest version.    You may need to upload a letter of authorisation insteadIf the name and date of birth on the driver licence or passport don't match the director’s name and date of birth recorded on the Companies Register, you will need to confirm authority by providing a letter of authorisation which is signed by the director.                                         Form CR-LOA Letter of authorisation template                PDF, 119 KB opens in a new windowOnce this is approved, you can log into the register and amend the name of the director, so that it matches the name on the ID.4. Confirming authority by providing a letter of authorisation from a director        Use this option only if you're unable to request company authority using the other options.    This involves submitting a completed letter, using a mandatory template, and uploading it as an attachment.It may take up to 3 working days for us to process your request.                                         Form CR-LOA Letter of authorisation template                PDF, 119 KB opens in a new windowIf it's the first time you've used the director ID verification or letter of authorisation methods        When you use the director ID verification or letter of authority methods for the first time, you'll be prompted to verify your own identity. This is a one-time identity check.If you are using director identification, you can complete an automatic check using your own NZ driver licence or passport. The name on the ID must match the name on your Companies Register online services account.The letter of authorisation method will offer the automated check options or you can upload another form of identity for yourself, for example, an overseas passport. This provides a way to identify yourself if you do not have a NZ driver licence or passport, however it will take a little longer as we manually check the uploaded document.We do not store any identification information provided.    The next stepsIf you choose to use the company key or the director ID verification service, we can confirm your authority immediately. The other options may take some time as they rely on a director or the Companies Office manually responding to your request.                    Confirm your authority                                Managing who has authorityBoth directors and authorised persons can accept or reject requests for confirmation of authority from others, or cancel an existing authority, but the degree to which they can do this differs.If you're a directorLog in to your online services account and select the ‘Authority’ tab on the dashboard. Directors with authority can see:all requests for confirmation of authority from other directors, or persons wishing to act on behalf of the companydetails of all authorised personsDirectors who receive an email request can approve or reject requests for confirmation of authority from:other directorsauthorised persons, such as accountants and lawyers, wishing to act on behalf of the company.Note        A company director doesn’t automatically get authority on the Companies Register upon company incorporation, unless they incorporated the company. Each director must otherwise have their authority confirmed using one of the methods described above.    If you're an authorised personAn authorised person can be someone who has an individual online services account with us (for example, an in-house accountant managing a company’s information) or someone who has an organisation account (for example, an accounting firm with several employees who need access to manage their client’s company’s information).Log in to your online services account and select the ‘Authority’ tab on the dashboard. An authorised person can see:details of other authorised personsprevious requests for confirmation of authority.Authorised persons can approve or reject a request for confirmation of authority from a director, but only if there is no existing director with authority.An authorised person can't accept or reject a request for confirmation of authority from another authorised person.How to approve or decline a request for confirmationIf you have authority, you may receive emails from other users requesting confirmation of their authority to act for the company. To accept or reject the request, open the email then follow these steps.Select the link within the email message.Read the statement carefully to ensure you're clear who is seeking confirmation of their authority.Select either ‘Accept’ or ‘Reject’.If you reject the request, you will need to select a reason from the drop-down box. If you select ‘Other’, provide a reason in the comments box.Click on the ‘Submit’ button.We will send an email to the person or organisation requesting confirmation, advising them of the outcome (including the reason, if their request was rejected).Keep your email address up to date        To ensure you receive the appropriate emails from us, or directly from the register, it's important that all directors have a current email address as part of their company’s director records on the register.    Revoking company authorityAuthority can be revoked under certain circumstances, such as when a director ceases to hold office or an authorised person no longer acts for the company.A director with authority:can revoke the authority of an authorised person, butcan’t revoke their own authority or that of another director.An authorised person with authority:can revoke their own authority, butcan’t revoke the authority of a director or another authorised person.How to revoke company authority for a directorYou can’t revoke a director’s authority using our online service.If you cease to be a director, your authority is automatically revoked when the register is updated removing you as a director.
