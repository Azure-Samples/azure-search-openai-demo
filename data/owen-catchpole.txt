Here my chemical engineering background gets applied to the development of extraction, separation and fractionation processes for the production of nutraceuticals, functional foods, dietary supplements and cosmeceuticals. Using biologically derived raw materials we work from laboratory-scale up to a semi-commercial scale.Our research has led to the establishment of supercritical extraction as a new industrial process in New Zealand. This included building and running NZ’s first commercial supercritical extraction plant. As a result we have enabled a range of high value products, supporting process and product patents for both New Zealand and international companies. I now work establishing food processing technology expertise in Auckland, and work closely with the FINNZ network.I am proud of being Callaghan Innovation’s first Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Aparangi.BackAreas of expertiseSupercritical extraction – processing & productsChemical, process & food engineeringFunctional food & nutraceutical product developmentTech transfer & scale-upBee products (honey & propolis)Marine lipid products and processingEducationB.
