Privacy Commissioner's 2019 inquiryFrom 2012 until 2018, for the most serious fraud allegations, we went to third parties for information without going to the client first.In 2019, an Office of the Privacy Commissioner inquiry found we had been acting inconsistently with our legal obligations for some fraud investigations. We accepted this findingWe accepted all 5 recommendations made by the Privacy Commissioner and made changes to the way we do investigations. We also undertook an independent review of our fraud investigation practices and policies and made more improvements in line with that.Our investigators now decide on a case-by-case basis whether to go first to the client, or third party, and to make sure the right amount of information is collected.Privacy Commissioner’s 2019 inquiryIf you were investigated before 2018If you were investigated before 2018 and want to know more about the information gathered about you, email privacyofficer@msd.govt.nz We'll get back to you as soon as we can.How we can helpBenefits and paymentsWorkOn a benefitHousingOnline servicesCheck what you might getFind workApply onlineMyMSDHow to stay safe onlineAboutAbout Work and IncomeAbout this siteAccessibilityPrivacy, disclaimer and copyrightContact usPhone numbers                    Find a service centre                    Facebook                    Twitter                    Feedback                              Help in other languages        Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa /
