THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient Flight #305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., While the flight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between seattle, washington, and keno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel. It was determined the hijacker,

two parachutes, and the

ransom money had disappeared when

the plane was inspected at Reno, Nevada.

Artist conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the FBI Exhibit Section and are considered

a reasonable likeness. The black and white composites were

prepared initially and sometime later the color composites

were prepared to épict the hijacker's complexion and age

more graphically.

The hijacker is described as follows:

Almost every skydiver who has ever flown

on a commercial airliner has looked out the

window and thought, "What would it be like

to jump from this jet? Is this a good spot?

Would I freefall or deploy right away? Where

would I land? Where is the nearest town?"

on Thanksgiving eve in 1971, one person did

jump from an airliner- with $200,000 of

stolen cash strapped to his waist. this jump

launched the largest manhunt in the nation

and changed air travel forever.

as he year was 1971. USPA had recently changed its

rame from the Parachute Club of America ind was

growing at the rate of 1,000 new members a ye2r. The

largest freefall formation on record was a 10-mian star.

Attempts so break the record that year with 14 jumpers failed.

Most skydivers jumped with motorcycle helmets, and a

stopwatch next to the altimeter helped with altitude awareness.

USPA produced a new film called "This is a Sport," which

sald for $100 to USPA members and $150 to nion-members

that's $700 in today's currency.

Taking Control of the Plane

On a rainy and windy afternoon before Thanksgiving,

November 24, 1971, a man described as tall, thin and in his 40s

purchased a one-way ticket from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle,

As the plane was caxiing for cakeoff, the mian handed the

* "usually short, half-hour flight circled and maintained a holding

pattern, as the captain calmly informed passengers that traffic ar

Seattle-Tacoma was delaying their arrival.

As flight 305 circled over Seattle, D.B. Cooper sat alone,

wearing sunglasses during most of the fight, chain smoking

and ordering two bourbons and water.

On the ground, the FBI immediately began searching for any

information that could tell them who D.B. Cooper was. Without

a psychological history of the hijacker, the airline decided that for

the safety of the crew, passengers and civilians in the vicinity, all

his demands would be, met. Authorities guickly collected the rans

som money from several local banks and rushed two military rigs

from McCord Air Force Base in Tacoma to Sex-Tac. But when

Cooper learned authorities had provided military rigs, he said they

were not acceptable and demanded stato-of-the-art freefall rigs.

Meeting the Demands

That evening, skydiver and master parachute rigger Earl Cassey

of Washington received a telephone call from a business associate:

who also happened so be the manager of Sea-Tac International Air:

port. The airport manager asked for two backpacks and two chest.

pack parachutes as soon as possible bur couldn's disclose the

resson. Cossey admits he wondered about the manager's roguest.

"But I trusted him completely and did as I was told," he says.

Cassey phoned the local drop zone at Issaquah, Washington,

and had a skydiver staying at the drop zone's loft collect the

parachutes and hand them over to authorities. He gave them

rwo of Cassey's personial backpacksione ficefall rig and onc-

Navy emergency NB-8 backpack-and two of the D'Z's chest.

packs. The parachutes were rushod 30 miles in a patrol cät from

the drop zone in Isaquah to Sea Tac ernational Airport.

In the meantime, flight 305 continued to circle for two hours

above Seattle, waiting for the ransom money and parachutes

to artive. Although the taptain and fight attendants calmly

reassured passengers it would be only a little longer, some

passengers had already suspected something was amiss.

When flight 305 finally landed at 5:45 p.m. in an unlit and

secuded area of the airport, passengers were told to remain

seated until they,got further instructions. As they patiently

waited in their seats, the 36 passetigers watched as the flight:

attendant walked down the aisle with a large money bag ahd

parachutes, Cooper then released all passengers and crew mem-:

wat cooper instructed the pilots to fly to Mexico City in the

following configuration: at an altitude no higher than 10,000

tect, no faster than 170 knots, landing gear down, flaps at IS

degrees and with the rear stairway lowered.

Once the hijacked jes took off, Cooper instructed the flight

attendant and pilots to remain in the cockpit. The flighs

artendant was the last to see Cooper. She said he was "rying

something around his waise."

Cooper demanded that the pilots fly the 727 manually, and

their $peed of approximately 170 knots came very close to the

stall point" All ait wäffic for the entire northwestern United

States was alerted of the hijacking and diverted from the arez.

However, two Air.Force F106 fighters, a T33 fighter jet trainer

and FBl agents in a helicopter trailed the 727.

During the flight, Cooper opened one of the reserve packs,

removed the canopy and cut two lines off, perhaps to use as a

rope to tic the money bag around his waist. The $200,000 in

$20 bills totaled 10,000 individual bills, weighing 21 pourds.

Reno before continuing: It was only after they landed that the

crew discovered thar Cooper, the money, his briefcase, raincoat

and one backpack and reserve parachute were gone.

The fighter jets and helicopter that had followed the hijacked

727 in the stormy conditions never saw or picked up on radar

any sign of Cooper of a parachute. As for the alleged bomb, it

too was gone. According to the flight attendant's description of

the explosives, the FBI suspocted shas the bomb was a replica,

though they could not say for sure.

That evening, rigger Cassey heard on the news that there was a

hijacking in progress. Stunned at the revelation, along with the

fact authorities had just requestod his parachutes, "I thought, 'Oh,

crap! There go my parachutes!"" Cossey recalls. "I was just laugh-:

ing at the stupidity of the guy and thought, "This guy's nuts.'"

After the jet landed in Reno, Cossey received another phone

call from authorities and learned exactly which parachutes they

gave to D.B. Cooper and which parachutes Cooper had keft on.

of my personal backpacks and two chest packs from the drop

Is was only after the aircrafi landed that authorities also

learned that, in his rush to provide the rigs, the skydiver

aocidentally gräbbed the drop zone's dummy reserve, marked

with a large. "X" and red closing flaps. The DZ used the dummy

reserve for students to practice deploying the reserve, scooping

the canopy out of the container and throwing it into the air and

over their heads. Cossey explains, "For the dummy rig, I cut

the reserve in half and sewed the panels together so that when

the student threw it out, I could just fold it up and put it back

in the container in half the time.

Cassey learned over the phone that Cooper look his NB-S pilor

emergency backpack and that his freefall rig remained in the air-:

craft. "When I carned which rig was missing, I thought, 'Oh, this

guy's crazy."" Cossey explains that the Navy emergency backpack

gency balouts as potentially low altitudes. The round canopy,

designed for extremely fase openings, didn': have a sleeve, much

like today's slides, so slow the opening. "That rig has a bad opien.:

rig shock it'l just rip your crotch apart," Cassey says bluntly.

Compared to the freefall rig. the emergency rig was made of

a slick nylon material, had absolutely no padding in the leg

straps and was significantly thinner. "The differences in the rigs

were obvious," Cossey says, "and anyone with any skydiving

experiencs would definitely cake the sport rig," Cassey adds

that Cooper may have purposely selecred the pilor's xig.

had military experience, he may have used the military rig

because that's what he wis familiar with."

In addition to the opening shock, Cassey also wonders if

•Cooper was even able to pull the ripcord, because the ripcord

: for the Navy emergency rig lies very flat againse the pilos's chest:

•Cassey says, "The ripoords for the sport rigs were bent up so

you could easily see and grab them. The Navy rig's ripcord is

designed so lie very flat so that it doesn't catch on anything unin-

sentionally. If Cooper was wearing his rainooat, I don's know if

hed even be able to find and pull the ripoord in the dark."

The dummy reserve marked with an X was also gone. Cossey

says, "That reserve was half the density of a regular reserve, and

is was obvious to anyone with experience that it wasn't a normal

reserve.". Cassey personally believes that Cooper had emptied

the dummy reserve, stuffed the cash in its container and wore

that on his chest as he jumped.

'The Manhunt

By calculating the last verbal contact with Cooper and when

the jet's pressure gauges indicated the back stairway snapped shur

(with the release of Cooper's weight) and open again, investiga-

cors estimated tha: Cooper most likely exited over the rural and

derisely forested cown of Ariel, Washington. Fifty-foot fir troes

cover steep hills; rolling down to the 12-mile-long Lake Merwin.

Authorities combed the area inch by inch, looking for some sign

of a parachute, broken tress or branches, monty or clothing. They

found nothing. How easily something could be overlooked in the

difficult terrain was demonstrated by the fact that two elderly

women found the body of a missing college student who had

been strangled. Authorities had missed it. One wealthy investor,

convinced tha: D.B. Cooper and the cash lay at the bottom of

the lake, used his private miniature submarine to search the floor

of the lake inch by inch. Again, the search came up empy.

News of the hijacking immediately hit the airwaves all across

the United States: As zuthorities searched the arez, country roads

in, Washington filled with cars and recreational vehicles searching

for any signi of a parachute, D.B. Cooper oxi-especially-che

money. In 1971, $200,000 in convenient $20 bills was an

immense amount of money, equal ta abour $900,000 roday.

The FBl agent assigned to the cast from the moment Cooper:

hijacked the Northwest Airlines jet was Ralph Himmelsbach of

Oregon. With his piloting experience daring back to the Army

Air Corps in the 1940s, Himmelsbach servod as the specialist

• for all aviation violations. With the intense media attention,

calls from the public from all around the nation poured in.

Needless to say, skydivers were suspect. "Many of the calls we

received concerned parachutists," says Himmelsbach. "Often,

the subject was a jumper who was also known to be bad, and

char combination gave us particular interest."

Agent Himmelsbach goes on to say, "Many innocent citizens

found themselves the focal poine of FBI interest because of a

change in lifestylo, participating in the sport of skydiving, a past

history of parachuting of juse an artitude of thrill-seeking that

made somoonic else suspicious." The FBI investigatod about two

dozen skydivers, but every suspoct either had an alibi for the nighe

of November 24; 1971, or was simply soo young to be Cooper.

The Chances of Survival

Whether Cooper pulled off the jump from the Northwess

Airlines jes was a source of immense controversy among skydivers

at the timic. Himmelsbach says, "Skydivers were mixed as to their

opinions of the potential success of the jump." Some said Cooper

could have easily pulled it off; others said nor so because of the

weather conditions and the jet's wind blass of almost 170 knots.

Rigger Cossey says, "If he didn't have any expeticnice, he

probably did some awful maneuvers going our of that plane. T've

seen jumpers spiral violently and never recover. I don'? know if

he would have even been able to regain his serises."

Also, Cooper wasn't wearing warm, protective clothing, gog-

gles, a helmet, boots or gloves. He jumped in his business suit and

slip-on loafers. The face that he jumped in a suit and ric-but ros

the fact that he wore orie-amazed investigators. In the 1970s,

mich and women dressed formally for air travel, and for Cooper to

have done otherwise would certainly have aroused suspicion,

Cooper apparently planned the hijacking carefully, but it's nor

dear whether he carefully planned the jump and landing. Investi-

gators concludod that Cooper hadn't pre-planned his exit spor, and

Himmelsbach says, "It's unkrown whether Cooper had survival

gezr, such as a knife, compass, food of marches, in his pockets."

Military experts advising flimmelsbich noted that a parichute

alone is valuable as a survival tool, referring to a manual called

"101 Uses of a Parachute for Survival." Other military specialists

speculated that perhaps no parachute was found because Cooper

buried his gear as soldiers are trained so do.

Effects on Air Travel

Hijackings during this era were common for political purposes,

and sky marshals inconspicuously flew on many of the routes.

Bus D.B. Cooper was the first to hijack an airliner for persorial

gain and the arst to actually make a parachute jump from a jet.

Others tried to copy his actions. According to Himmelsbach,

*Half a dozen hijackers tried to pull off the same caper in the

months fallowing Cooper's extortion, but none gor away with is.

They either were killed in the jump; overpowered by crow or

authorities or captured onice on the ground."

It wAs Approximately 8:15 pom., and the

hortliwest was experiencing a heavy rain

storm with occasional snow flurries,

windsup to 80 knots and temperatüres

of 20 degrees at altitude. Cooper

descended the lowered aircraft steps. He

held onto the hand rails and stood on

the stairs at 10, 000 feet in the wind

By 1970, pre-boarding screening had been in place in some

airports for some airlines, but gerierally, as D.B. Cooper did,

passengers simply walked up to the gate and boarded the aircraft,

with their carry-on luggage. The hijacking of Northwest Airlines

flight 305 initiated mandatory FAA screening procedures, and ar

Himmelsbach's initiative, all aircraft with back staircases became

equipped with a locking mechanism called the Cooper's Vain.

Agent Himmelsbach also initiated a regulation mandating,

that only FBI agents who are experienced piloes may interview

hijacked airline pilors. The day of Himmelsbach's retiremen, he

learned that the plane actually drifted toward the ease while the

pilot few it manually. The agent questioning the pilar at the

time wasn's a pilot himseif and did not pick up this information.

Himmelsbach now believes that Cooper exited 40 miles east

over Washougal, Washington, which prompted his rule.

Unsolved Mystery

Even with the intense media coverage and the enthusiastic.

public wanting to help, each and every suspect, lead, investiga-

tion and search led to a dead end. Months turned into years, and

Himmelsbach and his team were no closer to finding out wha

D.B. Cooper was, his whercabouts of the result of the jump

The largest and most significant pioce of eviderice in the

D.B. Cooper mystery came in 1980, when a boy and his family

digging a fire pit on the bank of the Columbia River uncovered

12 packets of deteriorated bills under three feet of wet sand.

Goologists and hydrologists concluded that the money was

deposited there by the river and had been in the sand for years.

The $5,880 found marched the serial numbers of Cooper's cash,

bur she other 9,706 $20 bills remain unaccounted for.

The FBi continues to receive and investigate phone calls and

leads regarding the case, and the file is literally ten feet long.

Although Himmelsbach has retired from the FBI, he continues

to give interviews to major magazines, newspapers and national

and international television programs regarding the case.

The D.B. Cooper case is the only unsalved hijacking in the

world. This infamous parachutist consumed Himmelsbach's pro-

fessional and sometimes personal life for years. Ironically, he inter-

acts with skydivers regularly now, as he hangars his 1952 Boranza

at Skydive Oregon: He says thar pilots and skydivers have a lor in

commion and admits, "I've associated with a number of skydivers

and have usually gotten along very well with them." Agent Him+

melsbach even made a skydive once and says, "Ir was an enjoyable.

expericnice, but I prefer the power and control of an aixplane."

As for the whereabouts of D.B. Cooper coday that

unanswered question is wha: keeps the mystery alive.

Details: Over the years, over one thousand possible subjects

meriting subilles have been processed by Seattle with the

assistance of virtually every Field Division. Most were quickly

To date, the hijacker of Northwest 305,

who parachute

from the

aircraft with the $200,000 ransom, has

not been identified.

Although it is very likely that the

hijacker did not survive the jump, it remains a possibility.

To: Criminal Investigative From: Seattle

Re: SE 164A-81-DNA, 11/05/2003

As hijacking was a capital offense at the time, DOJ has advised

that no statute of limitations exists.

For the information of VCMOS and receiving offices, a

recent resubmission of an item connected to the UNSUB, has

resulted in recovery of male nuclear DNA.

This DNA was suitable

for entry into CODIS and for identification and elimination.

Seattle has identified the below individuals from which a DNA

sample is desired to process a comparison.

A review is being conducted in Seattle to identify

possible candidates

for DNA comparison.

It is expected that this

review process will be lengthy, and leads will be set out in

several groups.

Due to the extensive and counterproductive media

coverage that may result from

these contacts,

all offices are

requested to exercise discretion in dealing with these leads.

Some of these suspects may have known they were considered a

person of interest, others may not.

Likewise the families may,

or may not be aware. In cases where the suspect is alive, oral

swabs should be solicited.

In cases where the subject is

deceased, all methods to include hair from shavers, brushes,

salvia from postage stamps, etc. should be considered. In those

cases where recovery of these items are not possible, obtain

proper death and burial records. Contact Seattle case agent

before asking family members for any exhumation authority.

Obtain samples by one of the following methods, in the

following order of priority:

1. Oral swabs from suspect (best)

2.

Toothbrush, shaver, brush, comb belonging to

suspect, or envelope with

saliva on flap or stamp

(second

best).

3.

Oral swabs from both surviving parents (third

best) .

4.

Oral

swab from two of suspect's natural children.

(fourth best) .

All family or possible suspects contacted should be

advised that

this is merely another investigative step following

advancement in technologies. No mention of the recovery of DNA

evidence should be made. Care should be given so persons

contacted are not lead to believe that they or their family

member are a suspect of great interest in this case.

discussions should be avoided. Refer any media inquiries without

comment to the Seattle Media Coordinator, SAL

Tat

• Any follow up leads to obtain these samples

should be set by receiving offices with a copy to seattle.

process he was lead to believe that he would only be a mechanic

until such time that he could assume the responsibilities of

managing the Heavy Duty Equipment Shop.

not capable of training this many students within one month

because it was very dilapidated and out of date. In many

Thus,

He felt that this much training did not even qualify the student

to be hired by any of the local heavy duty equipment operators

within the Phoenix Metropolitan area.

DERHAM advised that student would generally receive a

check for living expense costs for the first two weeks of their

stay at the school.

Subsequent to this, students would receive

an additional check from Sis for their living expenses during the

next two weeks of their stay.

DERHAM stated that once students

received the second check,

Sts did not care whether the students

departed the school or decided to stay and finish out their

course of study while in the Phoenix area. He felt that once the

second check was forwarded to the student, STS basically washed

their hands of all responsibilities towards the students.

DERHAM advised that he and his staff were told that

they were not to fraternize with the student attending the school

at any time during their stay.

Additionally, they

were told that

they were not even to speak to the student unless it was strictly

course related. He found this to be quite embarrassing on

numerous occasions, due to the many questions generated by the

students attending the course.

Even though DERHAM was not

allowed to converse with the students openly, he was able to get

the feeling from most of the student that they believed they

vould be gainfully employed upon completion of this course, at

to $20.00 per hour, and they would

have no difficulty in finding employment once they had completed

He did not know where the students had acquired this

type of opinion, but he was sure that it was not acquired within

the heavy duty equipment site here in Apache Junction.

DERHAM's opinion, most of the students that attended this course

would not even be qualified to get any type of a job within the

heavy duty equipment area upon completion of this course due to

the very limited number of hours available to each student upon

the machinery.

He felt that the recruiters must not have any type of

DERHAM had no knowledge regarding the financing or

means.

To date, the hijacker of Northwest 305, who parachuted

from

the aircraft with the $200,000 ransom, has not been

identified.

This case remains the only unresolved airplane

hijacking in U.s. history.

hijacker did not

survive

the

jump, it remains a possibility.

If

currently alive, the hijacker would likely be in his mid-70's.

As hijacking was

a capital offense at the time, DOJ has recently

again advised that no statute of limitations exists.

For the information of VCMOS and receiving offices, a

recent resubmission of an item connected to the UNSUB has

resulted in recovery of male nuclear DNA. This DNA was suitable

for entry into CODIS and for identification and elimination.

Seattle has identified the below individuals

from which a DNA

sample is desired to process a comparison.

A review is being conducted in Seattle to identify

possible candidates

only

for dNA comparison.

It is anticipated that

a very small minority of the original suspect pool will

qualify for this DNA project.

Phase II of this review involved

the completed review of subject subfiles 1-500.

Due to the extensive and counterproductive media

coverage that, in some cases, may result from these contacts, all

offices are requested to exercise discretion in dealing with

these leads. Some of these suspects may have known they were

considered a person of interest, others may not.

Likewise the

families

may, or may not be aware. In cases where the suspect is

alive, oral swabs should be solicited.

In cases where the

subject is deceased, all methods to include hair from shavers,

brushes, salvia

from postage stamps, etc. should be considered.

In those

cases where recovery of these items are not possible,

obtain proper death and burial records. Contact Seattle case

agent before asking family members for any exhumation authority.

In the event the suspect, and/or family, cannot be located,

receiving offices should set out appropriate leads to follow up

with an information copy to Seattle.

Obtain samples by one of the following methods, in the

following order of priority:

1.

Oral swabs from suspect (best)

2.

loothbrust

3.

4.

Oral swabs from both surviving parents (third

Oral swab from two of suspect's natural children.

Re: SE 164A-81-DNA, 07/29/2004

All family or possible suspects contacted should be

advised that this is merely another investigative step following

advancement in technologies. No mention of the recovery of DNA

evidence should be made. Care should be given so persons

member are a suspect of great interest in this case. Unless

specifically requested in lead, no interviews are needed at this

time, other than appropriate FD-302 to document DNA samples.

Media discussions should be avoided. Refer any media inquiries

without comment to the Seattle Media Coordinator, SAL

Any follow up leads to obtain these

samples should be set by receiving offices with a copy to

Seattle.

If anyone is uncooperative with this process, advise

Seattle.

Phase II unresolved suspects:

1.

JASON T. LANGSETH (SUB 327) SSN 525-52-5941 DOB

8/3/1934

**Caution - May Be Uncooperative Due to Prior Contact

With FBI**

Last known address:905 Fogarty Ave, Shelton, Washington

98584

(10/2003)

LANGSETH was originally identified as a suspect based

on information received from two individuals.

He resembled UNSUB

at the time, has military jump experience, and reportedly

discussed committing the "perfect crime" prior to the hijacking.

LANGSETH was only partially cooperative during his interviews in

1972 and 1977, and uncooperative when contacted in 1979 and

ultimately refused to answer further questions or take a

polygraph examination. Alibi information he provided concerning

his work activities and travel during November 1971 was proven at

least partially false.

last contacted in January 1979

while living in Campbell, California. Following that contact,

LANGSETH retained an attorney and refused a polygraph. In 1993,

LANGSETH was again identified as being the UNSUB by an another

associate who had viewed an "Unsolved Mysteries" segment about

this case. Contact Seattle Case Agent if further details are

desired.

Due to the passage of time, it is possible that

LANGSETH will now cooperate with a DNA sample.

Last known address: 6402 Mill Road, Egg Harbor

Township, New Jersey 08234.

CATALANO, a prior resident of Eugene, Oregon surfaced

as a suspect in 1972 on a referral from the Los Angeles Division.

One witness onboard NW 305

subsequently advised that CATALANO

bore a very strong resemblance to the UNSUB. Investigation could

not rule CATALANO out based a one week gap in his work attendance

at the time of the hijacking. CATALANO worked for IWA as a Purser

and, although pilot trained, was unsuccessful in securing a

flying job with TWA as he was described as a "rebel" by his

supervisor, and as someone who had money problems:

There is no

record that CATALANO was ever contacted by the FBI or has any

knowledge of his mention as a suspect in this matter.

3.

Richard Floyd McCoy JI. (deceased) (SUB 386) •

SSN 237-66-3779

**CAUTION SUGGESTED**

McCoy was convicted of a copycat hijacking of a United Airlines

flight in April, 1972 in which he successfully parachuted from

that flight over Utah with $500,000.

McCoy was

arrested/convicted of that offense and most of the hijack

proceeds were recovered. McCoy later escaped from prison and was

shot and killed in November, 1974 after drawing a weapon on FBI

Agents attempting his arrest in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

McCoy

never claimed to have been COOPER, and there was significant

differences in methodology between the two crimes. Evidence

indicated McCoy was in Salt Lake City on 11/25/1971, and had

possibly attended class at BYU on 11/24/1971.

Some evidence

exists that McCoy L

actually drove to Las Vegas on

11/24/1971. Although the weight of the evidence points toward

the elimination of McCoy, speculation continued. In July, 1972

McCoy allegedly told his Pre-Trial officer in Salt Lake City

prior to his receiving a 45 year sentence for the UAL hijacking,

that he had done "another one". In light of some contradiction

in evidence concerning McCoy, and the possibility that the

differences in methodology between the hijacking can be partially

explained as

a possible natural refinement of methods, a DNA

sample is being sought.

is recognized that

and appropriate caution should utilized. During McCoy's trial in

The Crime

On 11/24/1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a lone

White male boarded Northwest Orient flight 305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 p.m., while the flight was en

route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to the stewardess that

his briefcase contained a bomb, which would blow up the plane

unless his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000.00 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36 passengers aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his

instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and two airline

stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into the

first class section of the aircraft and informed them he desired

to fly to Mexico City. The hijacker instructed that the plane

proceed in a southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and

slow speed, which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere between

Seattle and Reno, Nevada, where the plane landed to refuel.

determined the hijacker, two parachutes and the ransom money

had disappeared when the plane was inspected at Reno.

considered a

i reasonable likeness.

ORIGINAI, MONTAGE

AGED TO 1999

LEADS :

1. TYPICAL - A relative or former friend resembles

UNSUB and has had previous parachuting experience. In addition,

he had "a lot of money" at about that time and he possibly said

he was "D.B. COOPER" while drinking in a bar.

NORJAK

Page 3

Age differences or height differences between the

suspect and UNSUB generally can disprove 95 percent of these

leads.

NOT TYPICAL - Suspect is dead and told witnesses he

was "D.B. COOPER." He also said he lost the money in the jump.

Age and height differences plus location on 11/24/1971

Or 11/25/1971 can be useful in processing these suspects.

This report contains the results of the nuclear DNA analyses and

supplements the FBI Laboratory report dated April 2, 2002.

Results of Examinations:

The STR typing results from specimens Q5-1, Q8-1, Q9-1, and Q16-1

were compared to the STR typing results from specimen Q40/Q41 [submitted under FBI

Laboratory Number 010904012 and reported in FBI Laboratory report dated April 2, 2002].

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from specimens Q5-1 (swabbing

from specimen Q5), Q8 (swabbing from flap area), Q9 (swabbing from flap area) and Q16-Q18

(swabbing from inside specimens Q16 through Q18) was subjected to DNA typing by the

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the amelogenin sex typing locus and the nine (9) short

tandem repeat (STR) loci of the AmpFiSTR Profiler PlusT™ ID PCR Amplification Kit.'

Specimen Q3-1 (swabbing from specimen Q3) was subjected to DNA

typing by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the amelogenin sex typing locus and the nine

(9) short tandem repeat (STR) loci of the AmpFISTR® Profiler PlusT™ ID PCR Amplification

Kit.' No detectable DNA and/or STR typing results were obtained from specimen Q3.

It is noted that the above specimens were submitted for comparison

purposes to be used as an alternate reference sample for DUANE LORIN WEBER; however, the

DNA profiles obtained from specimens Q5-1, Q8-1, Q9-1 and QI6-1 do not satisfy the DNAAUI

inclusionary reporting criteria and therefore may be utilized only for exclusionary purposes. It is

also noted that the DNA typing results obtained from specimen Q5-1, Q8-1 and Q9-1 indicate the

presence of different source individuals. Based on the STR typing results, specimens Q5-1, Q8-

I, Q9-1 and Q16-1 are excluded as potential contributors of the DNA obtained from specimen

Q40/Q41.

No other nuclear DNA examinations were conducted.

'The AmpFeSTR® Profiler Piusta ID PCR Amplification Kit includes the loci D3S1358, WA, FGA,

D8S1179, D21S11, D18551, DSS818, D13S317, and D75820.

Synopsis: To open subfile SE 164A-81-1060 for Lyle Collins

and to set phase II lead for investigation and

collection of DNA samples for submission to the Laboratory, DNA

1. This case remains the only unsolved hijacking in the United

States, and is commonly referred to as the "D.B. Cooper"

investigation. Items collected should be forwarded directly to

the Laboratory, DNA 1, Attention

The EC should

be uploaded to

• SE 164A-81-DNA.

Enclosures: Case information sheet. This information is also

available to be emailed.

Details:

Portland Division forwarded an EC to Seattle,

SE, 164A-

81 serial 9466, regarding Lyle Collins Franklin (Franklin).

Seattle

requests that Anchorage review

the enclosed Portland EC

and collect a DNA sample from Franklin's remains for submission

to the Laboratory, DNA 1. See attached Anchorage EC for contact

information on Franklin.

Over the years, more than one thousand possible

subjects meriting subfiles

were processed by Seattle with the

assistance of virtually every Field Division. Most, opened in the

initial stages of the investigation, were quickly eliminated;

some required extensive investigation to eliminate; and some

remained of interest and could not be included or excluded

through normal means.

not been identified. This case remains the only unresolved

airplane hijacking in U.s. history.

Although it is very likely

that

the hijacker did not survive

the jump, it remains

possibility. If currently alive, the hijacker would likely be in

his mid-70's.

Hijacking

was a capital offense at the time,

therefore, no statute of limitations exists.

• the information of VCMOS and receiving offices,

recent resubmission of an item connected to the UNSUB resulted in

the recovery of male nuclear DNA.

This DNA was suitable for

entry into CODIS and for identification and elimination.

Seattle seeks a DNA sample from the individual(s) listed below to

process for comparison.

Due to the extensive and counterproductive media

coverage that, in some cases, may result from these contacts, all

offices are requested to exercise discretion in dealing with

these leads. Some of these suspects may have known they were

considered a person of intorost, others may not. Likewise the

families may, or may not be aware. In cases where the suspect is

alive, oral

swabs should be solicited. In cases where the

subject is deceased, all methods to include hair from shavers,

brushes, salvia

from postage stamps, etc. should be considered.

In those cases where recovery of these items are not possible,

obtain proper death and burial records. Contact Seattle case

agent before asking family members for any exhumation authority.

In the event the suspect, and or family, cannot be located,

receiving offices should set out appropriate leads to follow up

Obtain samples by one of the following methods, in the

following order of priority:

1. Oral swabs from suspect (best)

2. Toothbrush, shaver, brush, comb belonging to

suspect, or envelope with saliva on flap or stamp

3.

(second best) .

Oral

swabs from both surviving parents (third

best) .

4.

Oral

swab from two of suspect's natural children.

Results of Nuclear DNA Examinations:

Specimens Q57 through Q62 were subjected to deoxyribonucleic acid

(DNA) typing by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the amelogenin sex typing locus and the

nine short tandem repeat (STR) loci of the AmpFISTR® Profiler PlusIM ID PCR Amplification

Kit.'

Based on the typing results from the amelogenin locus (for sex

determination), male DNA' is present in the DNA obtained from specimens Q58 and Q61. No

amelogenin typing results were obtained from specimens Q57, Q59, Q60, and Q62.

No STR typing results were obtained from specimens Q57, Q59, Q60, and

Q62.

The DNA typing results obtained from specimen Q58 indicate the

presence of DNA from two or more individuals and are suitable for comparison purposes. A

major contributor can be discerned from the DNA obtained from specimen Q58 and is suitable

for matching purposes. The STR typing results for the minor contributor to specimen Q58 are not

suitable for matching purposes; however, may be utilized for exclusionary purposes.?

The DNA profile obtained from specimen Q61 is not suitable for matching

purposes; however, it may be utilized for exclusionary purposes?

It is noted that the DNA typing results obtained for the major contributor

to specimen Q58 and the DNA typing results obtained for specimen Q61 are consistent with

having originated from the same male individual.

It is noted that specimens Q57 through Q62 were submitted as alternate

reference samples for WILLIAM PRATT GOSSETT. Due to the limited results obtained from

Q61, and the consistency of the DNA typing results obtained for the major contributor to

specimen Q58 and the DNA typing results obtained for specimen Q61, the major contributor to

specimen Q58 will be used for all future comparisons and designated as specimen Q58

(GOSSETT) to further differentiate it from the other questioned (Q) specimens analyzed.

The STR typing results for specimen Q58 (GOSSETT) were compared to

the STR typing results from specimen 040/Q41 [submitted under FBI Laboratory Number

010904012 HL MD and reported in FBI Laboratory report dated April 2, 2002].

Based on the STR typing results, Q58 (GOSSETT) is excluded as a

potential contributor to the mixture of DNA obtained from specimen Q40/Q41.

The STR typing results obtained from the tested specimens are not eligible

No other nuclear DNA examinations were conducted.

Methods/Limitations:

The following methods and limitations apply to the results/conclusions provided in the results

section(s) of this report and are referenced by number in the body of the text for clarity.

1. The AmpFISTR® Profiler PlusTM ID PCR Amplification Kit enables the human specific

typing of the STR loci D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317,

and D7S820. Insufficient DNA quality and/or quantity can affect the ability to generate a DNA

typing result and is not an absolute determination that an individual did not come into contact

with an item of evidence.

2. The presence of male DNA in a mixture may limit the ability to determine if female DNA is

also present in that mixture.

3. Inconclusive STR typing results can be due to insufficient DNA quality and/or quantity. In

order for the STR typing results to be used for matching purposes, sufficient DNA quality and/or

quantity is necessary.

This report contains the results of the examination of friction ridge prints.

Results of Examinations

The requested latent print examinations were conducted, but no latent prints were

detected.

Methods

Items of evidence submitted to the Latent Print Operations Unit for examination may

be examined visually, examined with various light sources, and/or processed with chemicals and

1 - 164A-SE-81

DB Cooper-33671

## Page 310

UNCLASSIFIED

powders to detect the presence of latent friction ridge prints. The specific sequence of

examinations and processes depends upon the nature of the evidence.

Friction ridge print examinations are conducted using the Analysis, Comparison,

Evaluation, and Verification methodology (ACE-V), which includes an assessment of the

quantity and quality of the information present. The steps of ACE-V are applied to each

examination as appropriate.

Analysis is the assessment of a friction ridge print to determine if sufficient reliable

details are present to conduct a comparison with another print and to reach an identification

conclusion. If these conditions are met, the print is determined to be "of value".

Comparison is the direct side-by-side observation of friction ridge prints of value to

determine whether or not the information in two prints is in agreement.

Evaluation is the formulation of a conclusion based on the information gathered

during the analysis and comparison of the friction ridge prints.

Conclusions that can be reached are as follows:

Identification - the determination that there is sufficient quality and

quantity of detail in agreement to conclude that two friction ridge prints

originated from the same source.

Exclusion - the determination that there is sufficient quality and quantity

of detail in disagreement to conclude that two friction ridge prints did not

originate from the same source.

Inconclusive - the determination that corresponding areas of friction ridge

prints are absent and/or unreliable and therefore cannot be identified or

excluded.

Verification is the independent application of the analysis, comparison, and

evaluation phases of the ACE-V methodology to a friction ridge print by another examiner.

Interpretations

Due to the many factors involved in the deposition of a friction ridge print, neither the

absence of a friction ridge print on evidence nor the exclusion of a friction ridge print with a

given source, disassociate that source from having touched the evidence.

this suggestion was approved

Enclosed are four (4) artists composites,

two black and white, and two color, depicting the

NORJAK unsub with and without glasses.

On November 24, 1971, a

lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient Flight #305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en

route to seattle, Washington, he indicated

to the stewardess that his brief case contained

a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the

36

passengers aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines complied with

his instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and

money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and

the two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the

first-class section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

jacker instructed that the plane proceed in a southerl

direction and fly at

a low altitude and slow spee

which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle,

Washington, and Reno, Nevada, Where

the plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the

hijacker, two parachutes, and the ransom money had

disappeared when the plane was inspected at Reno,

The IR.S. figures Cooper

would be taxed $53,000 on the

Occasionally, suspects are reopened because new

One suspect

that received national press coverage was JOHN EMIL LIST

(Suspect 203) •

LIST was considered a suspect because he became a

fugitive 15 days prior to NORJAK.

He matches the general

description of UNSUB, also known as DAN COOPER. He killed his

family partially because he was despondent over monetary

problems.

He served in the military and may have had airborne

The attached information was taken primarily from

manually recorded notes during conunications con-

nected with the high-jacking of Northwest Airlines

• Flight 305, November 24/25, 1971.

The primary method of communication with the flight

was direct between MS:FO (Flight Operations) and

SEADD (Flight Dispatch), the flight, Sex and SFO

ARINC, RNO Tower.

Due to the inability so copy everything exactly

and as rapidly-as it occurred, there may be some

errors in the following. It is

not believed that

they are likely to be

that the aft stairs be extanded after take-off. Later speci

dewn impossible due to inability to

rotate airplane.

T'hen

since stairs could not be held in any intermediate position.

U.S. would be permitted "for fuel or anything else'. Then

ary information on optimum range IS (170K), weather, air-

ports available between Sis and RiO, minimum obstriction

clearance altitudes, etc.

ISPFO asked for stewardess best recollection of exact content

of HJ briefcase. She got on radio and gave following basic

informa tzon:

• Bight red sticks, about 5!' x 1" in left corner of brief

case, "look like big firecrackers." Two rows of sticks,

four on top of four.

- wire attached to dynamit with red insulation.

- Battery "like flashlight battery, but about f" high and

as big around as my arm''

- Red sticks are about, the color "of my uniform".

Crew called HiJ and asked him if everything was O.K. and he

replied

that it was. This was appatently the last communi-

cation the crew had with the 1J.

Cret reported oscillation of cabin rate of climb indicator.

This probably due to hiJ reight now on stairs, stairs extending

further, resultant effect on cabin pressure. May be best

estimate of when he exited airplane.

FBI coordinator Tom Manning said Friday that

an experienced jumper.

"If he is in the area and has landed in rough terrain,

it's. an educated guess we will get some trace of him,'

Manning said. "We have to presume at this point he is still

alive."

AUTHORITIES disclosed Friday that: the $200,000:.

Northwest Airlines paid: the skyjacker in response to a

bomb threat was supplied in $20 bills - a packet of 10,000

bills that weighed 24½ pounds and measured 8 by 6 by 27

A 100-man posse, aided by i0 patrol cars and six heli-

The

the plane. Five planes followed the jetliner all the way and

three picked it up en route to Reno. But officials had said:

earlier that theichase planes would have difficulty spotting

a skydiver at night it he did not opèn his parachute imme-

So was the $200,000, the briefcase a stewardess said

had contained objects appearing to be sticks of dynamite,

parachute to bind the money to him when he jumped.
