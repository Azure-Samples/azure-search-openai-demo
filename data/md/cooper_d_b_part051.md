Dear

I have already apologized to your mother for the delay

in responding to your request for assistance in writing a term

paper on D.B. Cooper, but let me also apologize to you for not

replying sooner.

There were many reasons, some of which are

valid; others not so excusable.

I hope that this belated letter

will mollify not having had a quicker return to your well-written

letter.

Thank you for choosing such an interesting and still

unsolved case to research.

D.B. Cooper is still an open case and

unless it is solved, will remain so until well

into the twenty-

first century when the subject of the case would have

passed away

naturally.

We still do some investigation regarding it; however,

almost every logical angle has been addressed without success.

Around the anniversary date, numerous leads are received from

throughout the world.

This results from an increase in publicity

given by the media.

We attempt to follow all logical leads, most

of which have been

previously considered or are fabricated.

Inasmuch as the case is still open and pending, it is

against our policy to discuss any details with non-law

enforcement personnel beyond what we have already revealed to the

I have included a brief synopsis of the events that lead

up to

the last sighting of the individual known as D.B. Cooper.

This is probably a fictitious name only used for ticket and

manifest purposes by the hijacker. I have also included four

different photographs of the artist conceptions as created by

interviews of other passengers and the flight crew.

As you can

see, there was quite a variance in how he was described.

I told you yesterday I was very angry when I received your letter dated January 24, 1973. In it

you wrote:

screw up everyday! But I think that precludes the statement that everything will work out as God

so desires; I cannot believe the last 25 years have been as God so desires. Maybe in your life,

but not in mine!

By the way, l'm.no.longecang.at.you! I should have been courteous enough to answer your,

letter, but I probably would have written something for which I would have had to apologize!

years to analyze these experiences, so, I guess i wonder if you ever picture. Jas some one

who abandoned his family? While it is true, we do not know what happened, and that is what

D.B. Cooper Skyjacking Case - Most Probable

Location of Cooper's Remains.

Honorable Director Freeh:

This no doubt sounds somewhat unusual, but

partner and I collected and comprehensively analyzed al

f the available information on the Cooper case as a hobby an

professional challenge. In doing so, using our over 70 years

of combined law enforcement and investigative experience, we

concluded with at least ninety-percent certainty that D.B.

Cooper's remains were scattered by wildlife on one of the islands

shown on the enclosed maps, after he free-fell to his death

ur investigation included interviews with

the case agent; and

and expert parachutist. They both

estimated Cooper's free-fall drift to be about one mile to the

northeast of where he jumped. From this information and other

data, we believe he most likely landed on Government Island.

We further concluded that all of the money went into the

Columbia River and decomposed, except for the partially

decomposed $5,800 found on a bank of the Columbia in February

that that find was

and

proof

that they had searched the wrong

areas near the Lewis River

in 1971 and 1972. Although the Fort Lewis Army troops did find

two other unrelated bodies during those searches.

My partner lives in the

Washington, area, which

prompted our review and analysis of this case. He had planned

to

search Governement Island, as he had done on other islands,

but discontinued his efforts for several valid reasons. One

being the marijuana growers who protect their illegal crops

with booby-traps, as explained in the enclosed newsclipping,

in addition to maps of the target search areas.

In that he decided his searching could be too hazardous,

we decided to apprise the Bureau of our comprehensive conclusions

for whatever value they might be to solve this case.

We also believe that a law enforcement search

may reveal

other crimes, evidence,

or bodies like found in 1971 and 1972

in the Lewis

River areas, in addition to the well-publicized

nineteen ninety-six.

The time is

twelve fifty-five p-m.

We're

currently at the Linn County Courthouse in the polygraph room. Present

in the room with me isl

Jand his

birthdate isl

T Albany.

hey both reside a

ome phone number i

You both are aware that we're tape recording this?

Yes.

Uh-huh.

No.

And do you have any objection to that?

Okay.

Uh, now bear in mind that we are tape recording, so uh, try

to keep your hand gestures down to a minimum and explain you know?

Oh yeah.

Right. What are we here to talk about today?

okay. We're here to talk about D-B Cooper.

A friend of mine back

in nineteen sixty-one.

I lived in Yreka, California, well, sixty,

it was sixty actually when I lived there, in nineteen sixty I met

this guy. Had just gotten out of the service he said and I

thought he said he was from Los Angeles, now I'm not sure about

that, he was from Los Angeles, we had parties together and stuff,

he was always there at the parties, never drank, much,

seven years older than I was and what we find out now he could

have even been older, but like I say he was at different parties

with us and he never

joined in with us on anything, you know he

stood back and watched us, laughed, joked, you know he was that

kind, but he was not a rough and tough guy. He was not a fighter

or you know, bragged about fighting like we did, see we was pretty

into that stuff, that's what made him so different see, he was,

you know, more grown up than we were, you know, but he still hung

around with us and he lived there at uh, at Yreka in the

and

one day I went to get my check and I was walking by and

he went with me, I think we went to the post office to get our

checks and uh, we got to talking and uh, he cashed his check and

he wanted to uh, he was telling me that uh, well he ca, everytime

he got his check every week, the one thing that you know, he made

sure he got was a crab louie, he had to have this crab louie, that

was his reward you know, every week, and then he told me he had so

restaurants and now I can't remember which restaurant, whether it

was in the hotel or the little restaurant down the street,

and I think I just had coffee and he had his crab louie whichever

restaurant was it and that's when I asked him, you know, uh, where

you from and I remember it was a big town and I thought Los

Angeles and uh, you know, I asked him where his relatives, you

know, who, you know, his dad, mother, he said that uh, he was

and that the people that

him were older people, they were quite a bit older, they

were way up there and they never seen eye to eye on anything and

they wanted him to be something else and he didn't want to be

this, whatever they wanted him to be, so he just left them, he

he didn't care about them, you know, he had nothing in common

with them, cause they were older people and he didn't really care

about even finding his mother and dad, he had no idea who they

were, and that's all I can remember right there, then

He was drawing unemployment

Yeah, he, well that's what he told me, he was drawing unemployment

out,

what I gathered from the service, I was drawing because I

worked, you know in the saw mills and then in the winter, and this

was kind of in the winter time, towards it, I think, because I

remember at the time he was different dress than we were, we were

in the black leather jackets and levis like and uh he wore

was

lot, and I always got the impression that he

in the air force for some reason because of the turtleneck

server and we never

sweaters, I don't know why, whether they're, cause I was never ir

the service, so I didn't, you know, know that much about the

service and we never talked much about the service

And he said he was a paratrooper.

Yeah, well, that's what he said, in the service he was a

paratrooper and that's what he did and I don't know how long he'd

been out of the service, drawing, I always thought drawing the

unemployment he much have just got out in the, in the, in with

that year or something, I don't know, uh, cause I'm not really

sure if that's where he, you know that's what he told me, that's

all I know is what he told me, and then we went on and uh, me and

my wife went back together in

the meantime, in uh,

* :

This was the previous wife.

Yeah, a previous wife, we went back together in Dec, around

December and moved back to oregon and uh, let's see,

we partied

with him then and stuff and then, you know, I knew him good enough

to talk to him, I liked him, he was the kind of guy that he just

grew on you real, you know,

he was just a good guy, as far as you

know, and considerate, he was always considerate to the women and

everything, but you never seen him with that many women, he went

with a couple of them, but uh, uh, he was no, you know, the other

type like the rest of us were,

or a loner.

He was a little more of a loner, but reserved, but yet, would stay

in the middle of us, you know,

and laugh and set back and watch us

a lot, and then

so we come back in the first part of December, I

come back up and that's the last time I seen him, well I've got

pictures and stuff of him now, with the dates on

them, in

sixty-one the girl that went with him and everything, or was with

him, you know, and the boyfriend, her boyfriend and then we didn't

see him again

until nineteen seventy-one, it was in July of

nineteen seventy-one, he called from Canada, right on the border

of Canada, I believe

Langley and I'll tell you why I believe

Langley, but uh he called and wanted to know if uh, me and my wife

wanted

to go to Reno

with him and his girlfriend, he wasn't

married, we never knew him to be married, it was

his girlfriend,

and we said sure, come down, so we set a date I remember and he

came down right after that to pick us up in the airplane, he flew

from Langley to Albany in the airplane and got a taxi, I think

the airport and came to our house on

over in south Albany, I lived there at the time and we was all in

the room there getting ready to go and it was in the morning like

before ten o'clock I believe somewheres in there and we had a

baby-sitter, woman to baby-sit that we had gotten for the kids

cause I had five kids and they were, her and women were all, you

know,

telling the baby-sitter what remember what to do and you

know, this and that, he'd been it the bathroom and he come out and

oh, oh,

turned around and seen who was talking to you, you'd think that

the guy was bigger than what he was, he was about five ten to five

eleven, maybe six foot, he wasn't taller, much taller than I was

at about the same and I was about five eleven,

but he had a voice

when he was excited, especially or laughing, you could really hear

that deep, you know,

he, he and he, you'd look at his mouth

especially his mouth cause it was small, but that big a voice

coming out of that small mouth, I always remembered that, and when

Page 3

DB Cooper-21160

## Page 57

he called me up on the telephone from Canada, I knew right away

who it was because he had a,

that much of, I

thought a distinctive

voice, but the other ones I've talked to said they didn't never

catch

it, but I, I do and uh, so like I say he said let's get this

show on the road, we got in my car, went out to the Albany airport

and got in the plane, he went in and filed a thing on the flight

plan, I guess you call it, and we flew from there to Klammath

Falls and it seems that we stopped in Klammath and ate or got a

sandwich or something there, and I think he gassed up, I'm not

sure, then we went from Klammath to Reno and it was starting to

get dark as we was approaching Reno, that's why I thought we

stopped, because we must have killed some more time cause knew

that it would probably get dark around eight o'clock or something

at night and he was, you know, flying the plane and uh, like I say

it was starting to get dark and he handed me the map and he said

uh, something about we should pass a lake and then we should see

the lights of Reno, and I looked down at the map and I said well

there's a lake here but it's dried up well no, I said yeah the

lakes here, and when I looked out I could see what looked to be

like a lake, but it was all dried up and he thought well, then I

don't know I said well it's what it looks like and, and he didn't

evidently have time to you know, take his eyes off

something to look at the map real good, but then all, cause that's

when I thought oh my God it's getting dark and you know, there's

no lake, there's no Reno, we kept a going, we kept a going, and

I'm scared of heights anyway, I'm scared to death, so I remember

that and then all of a sudden he had this beeper or something that

went beep, beep told him to turn and I said well the map says this

and he said well my beeper, I got to go by it, I said okay, do

whatever you got to do, so we made the turn I remember and went

for another five, ten minutes, nothing and then all of a sudden

seen the water, you know, real light, we could tell it was a lake,

a big lake there of some kind and then we went by it and then we

see the lights of Reno and that's when he got on the, on the C-B

or whatever they carry in there and called in and they brought us

in on radar, so we flew on in to there and it was say nine o'clock

at night, somewheres in there, dark, we took the cab from the

airport to Reno, we got us a room, we went up and ate, he won

fifty dollars there on the dime jackpot standing in line, I

remember that, and we gambled that night, probably I would say

till two,

three o'clock in the morning, maybe later, got up the

next morning, went to the airport, got a cab went to the airport,

and uh, it could have been later,

cause the women were real sleepy

so we could have gambled, I don't know how long we gambled but we

went back to the airport, got in the airplane, he did all his

thing about the flight plan and all this, we got out on the runway

and was taxying down the runway, if, at whatever miles an hour,

you know just starting to taxi, he said I feel a vibration, he

said do you feel a vibration I

said no, let's just go, let's get

Page 4

DB Cooper-21161

## Page 58

out of here, you know, let's get this over with, I want to get

back home anyway, I said it feels fine to me and un, so he turned

to the women in the back and uh, he said do you guys feel any

vibration and they said yes, it's vibrating bad back here and

: then

he said oh, oh, oh you guys just want to go back and gamble some

more, I said well let's go he said no, I got to go back and have

this checked, so he turned the plane around, took it back to the

wherever he took there and they run it in and had them work on it

and look at it and in the meantime we went inside and I think we

was gambling, I don't remember, we did something in there and

come

to find out it was a stuck valve and so that held us up for

another couple hours and they got the stuck valve fixed and then

we took off, cause I remember taking off out of Reno, going over

that mountain there was big hill there or something, and we was,

to me we wasn't fifty feet from over the top of that sucker, but

from there seemed like we went to Redding or somewheres down

around Redding and

came back up, because I remember going over,

well that's, anyway we stopped in Yreka, Yreka, California, we

stopped there, got a cab, went to Yreka, that's where we all knew

each other, see and he kind of wanted to see if there was anybody

see cause we hadn't been

back there in ten years, we ate and did this and that and then we

went and got back in the plane and is why I know that uh, well

everytime we would gas up, you know, we had to, he always stressed

the point that it was hot, the hot, you know the heat was so hot,

and full of gas with four people in that little bitty plane and I

think it was a sesna one twenty-five, I'm not sure, it was a small

plane, just two, the people, you know pretty close in the backseat

when they sat back there and when we took out of Yreka,

I didn't

think we was gonna make it there, because you come right to the

end of runway, it was a short runway and he knew that and he knew

the runway and he said you know, it looked like we might go off,

you know, plop off the end, but

we got, you know he had everything

full power and all this gas and oh god,

I was, anyway we made it

and then we was flying over wherever we was flying over the rocks,

what'd you say that place was where the big rocks?

Castle Craig.

Castle Craig just out of Redding, cause I remember that we was

right on top

of them and how pretty it was and I thought man if we

hit in there you know what would happen you know, and then later

we flew a little

further and it was all forest I remember, all

trees, everywhere you could see was just trees, and I said man, I

said what would you do if that engine quit right now, what would

we do, we'd go down wouldn't we, yes,

he said yeah, and he said

here,

he said he looked out and

I he said see those two big trees

over there, he said uh, we'd fly right into those two big trees,

shear off the wings and then we would go down, that would slow us

:

down and then we'd fall down and you know, probably not get hurt,

oh Jesus criminy, but nothing ever happened, you know, just get me

home, so we flew on home and there at the airport, like I say it

was getting close to evening then, it wasn't dark,

but I think it

was probably here it got dark around nine in, I think in July,

somewhere

When you got back to Albany.

When we got back to Albany. Uh, we got out of the plane, and I

said well you guys come on, I had my car there, I said well come

on to the house and we'll talk a while and then you can take off,

he said no, he said uh, there's a certain area I want to fly over

that I can look over on the way back, and I you know, want to do

it while it's daylight, and we shook hands and everything and he

got out and they went back to, back to canada, he lived right on

the border he said, in fact when we was talking there he, I said

uh, well where you know, I just started this new job, so I, you

know, we was planning on going to Canada, you know,

sometime and I

yeah we're gonna come up there someday, he said well come on

up I live right on the road, he said the next town after you hit

Canada right there, and the only one I can figure out is Langley,

because that's where the airport is, that's where he flew the

airplane out of, cause he says it's right on the, as you go

through, he said just drop right in and you'll be right there, I

mean you got to go through my town anyway where I live, right on

the border,

well I've never been to Canada, so I really didn't pay

much attention to him, that's all I remember of that part of it,

that, you know, if we come up, but then I thought everything was

_ maybe, uh, small, built nice, uh,

I would say, kind of blondish, but more kind of brown, a

quiet, she was real quiet, and uh, where was I at

Do you recall her name?

No I don't.

Okay •

Now I might be able to get that later, I don't know, but I doubt

whether my ex-wife would know the name. Uh, okay, now I know

where I'm at now, uh, okay that was in July, a few months later,

it wasn't, now, this time he come down in seventy-one, it was

July, I know that, there was no highjacking there, or we'd have

not, the moe ho

talked about it, him being a pilot and all this stuff, so a few

months later, it wasn't very long later when he called me fron

Portland, said he was in Portland, said him and his girlfriend hac

broke up and I thought man that was strange they got along good,

you know, there was no

arguing or fighting amongst them, you know,

when we

was together, of course she never said much, so I don't

know what was going on between the two of them, so uh, he said him

and his girlfriend had broke up and that he was in Portland and I

said oh, and he said uh, is what I need to know, he said, if I

come down that way, can I stay at your place a few days, I said

well sure come on down, he said, well I got some business to take

care of and then I'll be down and I said okay,

and there was no

laughing, talking, joking or that, he was really serious, you

know, it was just like to me, like he was depressed, I don't know,

you know, he just, cause he was the type of guy we always joked,

you know, and he

said I'll be down, and I said fine, yeah, you can

stay here, come on down we look forward to seeing you and hung up

and uh, never heard from him since, never

Never, never did show then?

Never showed and we lived in the same house for fifteen years.

And he was trying to think back of when he got that phone call and

he, he said that he had gone to work at L

shift and that uh, so he would have been home

on the swing

oh that's

in the early afternoon.

See the thing of it was I never answer the phone in my house cause

four girls and one boy that always answered the phone and

the wife, so I never answered the phone, and the phone was never

one of my things, but that day I was sitting in my chair, I

remember! I, at the time, thinking about it later, I didn't know

it was night or day, you know when it was, but I knew

everybody was gone, so later I got to thinking, well it was on a

You mean be home?

Nobody'd be home, if I and I, and I went back and figured out I

was on swing shift so I'd have been sitting in that chair getting

ready to go to work around, I think I went to work at three

thirty, was my time and I always went early, so I would have been

sitting there and nobody was there when the phone rang and when he

called, so I was thinking, he could have even called, if that was

him, he could have even called from the airport, cause in reading

the stuff and everything he had an hour to kill, but I can't

figure if, if he called me, why I would answer the phone in the

evening on a Wednesday night and nobody'd be there, if it'd have

What was his name?

It would help.

Okay, now we, I called the girlfriend that knew him

and she, what she'd say his?

She said either

might be his middle name.

But she wasn't sure.

Oh yeah, he knew what he was doing with airplanes.

Cause he seemed to know what he was doing

He knew everything, I mean

Do you know if the plane belonged to him or did he

No, he rented it, cause he said, I remember now I got to thinking

again at the time this happened

on that indicator thing, he said

he was glad he didn't take this other plane because it didn't have

an indicator, it just had a radio, I guess, but evidently he

That's where he stayed at, but we don't know

But, but he's not sure, that's where'd he see him, you know.

Now he told me what he did in Langley and for some reason I, it

always was in my head that he either worked in a, a mine something

to do with driving a truck in a mine or a mill, I don't know, but

down there he never worked in the mills, so I don't know what, it

was one, something like that, down in something it seemed like, or

The purpose of the crime was to

way from this act.

that he was

Dear

b6

b7C

blessed us with a wonderful Christmas

and I had to share this fantastic news with you.

Food For The Poor has been promised $400,000 from a

group of generous benefactors.

The gift is critical

because we need over one million dollars to help 50

destitute orphanages.

However, in order to receive

this gift, we must meet three conditions:

1) We must raise an additional $400,000 from

concerned friends like you to match

this

gift

dollar for dollar.

2) The money has to be used to help abandoned

children and orphans in the Caribbean and Latin America.

3) Most importantly, we must raise all the

matching funds by December 31 or we will lose this

remarkable opportunity.

- This 'is a chance for you to double the value of

and double the help you give to orphans an

Your gift will go

twice as far to give the most helpless of God's poor

children what they really need for Christmas - food,

clothing and other essential items.

Your matching gift of $25 or $50 will show all of

these abandoned orphans God's love and care through

over, please

DB Cooper-21254

your compassion.

For, when you send a gift to help

them, you are really giving it back to God, who gave

us the most precious gift of all - His Son, our Savior.

However, if we don't find the money to match this

gift, we'll lose this opportunity.

That is why I pray

you will consider writing a check today so we can meet

this urgent deadline.

I only wish you could personally see the beautiful

faces

of the children ... children like María at Father

You are such an important part of Food For The

It will be a great loss to the children and the

That's why your gift this holiday season

CAA - Hijacking

Synopsis: To outline status of requested DOJ statute of

limitations and venue review and highlight significant leads

currently outstanding.

Details:

Following a comprehensive review of investigation

possible in this case at this date, the following steps have been

taken:

Statute of. Limitations and Venue Issue

Previous opinions

from the Seattle U.S. Attorney's Office

and DOJ from 1976 (serial 6841, Sub JJ and DOJ letter dated

8/11/1975 - attached) indicate

that this was a capital offense

and thus

not subject to a statute of limitations.

It is this opinion that has been used as a basis for the case

remaining pending.

In addition, Portland filed a "John Doe"

indictment in 1976, just prior to the tolling of a normal five

year statute.

It was apparently the opinion of the Seattle USA's

Office and DOJ in 1976 that subject COOPER was not sufficiently

identified to present such an indictment. Portland decided at

the last minute to file an indictment apparently as a fall-safe.

The investigative file for this case has always resided in

Seattle.

request a DOJ review of A) If this matter would be

prosecutable now or in the future pursuant to the capital offense

opinion, B) the validity of the "John Doe" indictment returned in

Portland in 1976, and C) the likely venue (Seattle or Portlana)

for a prosecution should a subject be identified.

Significant Pending Investigative Efforts

Seattle continues to get a fair number of tips concerning

this case. Although the majority are quickly eliminated, perhaps

one per month requires follow up. Of these, about four/five per

year require leads be set to other Divisions.

The only significant outstanding lead at this time involves

a deathbed confession of an individual who claimed to be COOPER

(DUANE LORIN WEBER Sub 1055). This lead is being pursued.

It is likely that any identification of COOPER at this date

will result from either a spontaneous confession or application

of newer investigative technology. In this regard, two steps

were undertaken:

1. The DNA Unit was contacted and agreed to perform an

inknown subject analysis on the numerous cigarette butts left by

COOPER on the aircraft that day. They believed it likely that DNi

could be recovered.

2. Leads were set out for the Latent Fingerprint Section to

perform automated analysis of the 70 latent fingerprints

recovered from the hijacked Northwest Airlines aircraft in 1971.

These Latents will be processed through a variety of FBI and

state AFIS systems that did not exist until a few years ago.

There are additional investigative steps possible which

involve considerable manpower.

It is suggested that these be

held in abeyance pending the receipt of the written updated DOJ

opinion.

Attention:

Crime Aboard Aircraft - Hijacking

NORJAK;

SE 164A-81; CR 72-0451

Dear Ms. Pflaumer:

Pursuant to recent conversations between AUSAL

and SA

_concerning the statute of limitation concerns connected with this case, I

am enclosing record of two communications with your office from February and April of

1976. Both of these were previously faxed to AUSA

Jon April 24, 1998.

As you are aware, from time to time this investigation continues to garner

significant media attention, even though the hijacking occurred in November of 1971. It

remains the only unsolved skyjacking in U.S. history. The Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) continues to receive numerous inquiries and occasional tips which

necessitate significant investigation to include or exclude an individual as a possible

subject. Although over the years there has been a system developed to streamline the

review of these potential suspects, nevertheless, significant investigative resources are

expended, not only by the Seattle office of the FBI but numerous offices throughout the

United States. It is, of course, the policy of the FBI that any pending investigation, if

prosecutable, will continue to be pursued to the fullest extent possible until such time as

prosecution becomes unlikely or a deceased subject is identified. In light of the

passage of 26 years since this crime, we believe an updated review of the statute of

limitation and venue issues is necessary.

This crime was considered a capital offense at the time and an opinion

was rendered by DOJ that no statute of limitation existed. As you may recall, a "John

Doe" indictment was nevertheless returned by Federal Grand Jury in Portland, Oregon,

in November of 1976, shortly before the expiration of the normal five-year statute. From

the enclosed documents, it appears unclear if this "John Doe" indictment is legally valid.

We would appreciate if your office would obtain a written opinion from the

Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning the current prosecutability of an individual, if

identified, for this crime. We would also appreciate if this written opinion expressed by

DOJ could include the expected venue for any prosecution (Western District of

Washington vs. District of Oregon).

Please direct any response or questions you may have to Special Agent

at telephone number (206) 667-0171.

RE: NORJACK

Per our telephone conversation this date, the Laboratory Division, Latent Fingerprint Section

(LFS) will make every effort to complete the requested latent print examination in the referenced

case by the following-dates:

June 12, 1998--Comparison of any latent prints on memo and resume submitted with Seattle EC

6/18/97 and previous latent prints with available prints of DUANE LOREN WEBER

June 19, 1998--Comparison of any unidentified latent prints on memo and resume with

elimination prints to be submitted by Seattle Division

June 26, 1998-Comparison of suspect prints generated as a result of automated searches of

previous and/or curtent latent prints

July 2, 1998--Comparison of unidentified latent prints on memo and resume with previous latent

prints (if feasible)

Obviously, there could be unforeseen circumstances that will prevent the LFS from meeting

these target dates, but in the event that appears likely, you will be immediately advised of the

situation by Fingerprint Specialist|

or me.

You will be telephonically advised of any positive results as soon as that information becomes

available and of the results of each completed stage of the examination.

Re: News article from Associated Press dated 11/25/96

November 4, 1998

Federal Bureau of Investigation

915 Second Ave. Room 710

Seattle, WA 98174

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am doing a study of the D. B. Cooper hijacking that may or may not have been

successful, and there are a number of questions that are quite puzzling to me, and

probably many other folks also, and I'm hoping your office might be able to supply some

insight.

My questions have to do with a few things that were not made clear in the news articles,

and perhaps there are reasons for the omissions, or maybe no one thought they were

important.

The first inquiry has to do with the type of conveyance used to carry the money. If it was

some sort of a satchel with a handle or a heavier hand-bag or zippered bag, and he bailed

out with two chutes on, he would be traveling at free-fall speed of about, what, sixty

miles an hour or so? He would never be able to hold on to the bag when the chute popped

open. If he were carrying the money in a package, he would have lost it.

The article also said that there were two pilots and a flight attendant aboard, when the

plane took off from Seatac Airport. All of the passengers and two flight attendants

deplaned there as part of the deal, and the money and four parachutes were put aboard.

Now the Boeing 727 requires a three-man crew-—what happened to the flight engineer?

Did Cooper not know he was up there? Did he get off with the passengers? If not, there

were five people aboard not four. In addition, the B-727 is a difficult aircraft to operate

without a flight engineer that operates all of the systems.

Cooper had asked for four parachutes. Has anyone figured out why he wanted four

chutes?

Another question that's troubling me; where did you get tour parachutes late-at-night?

That's a hard thing to find during daylight hours!

I'm assuming they were military--almost had to be.

I am hopeful you'll be able to shed some light on these thoughts. I certainly understand

that your department has more than its share of tasks to perform without fooling around

with these kinds of requests, but I'm an old man trying to put a story to bed, and I could

use a little help.

I agree with

who inherited the case when it happened.

He had long maintained that Cooper either landed in the Columbia River and drowned, or

died in the mountains. What's more, I can only speculate as to what actually happened,

but I would certainly appreciate any assistance you may be able to offer that would heir

me to build a story.

Synopsis: Prosecutive update received.

Details:

Referenced EC advised that an updated prosecutive

opinion

from DOJ concerning

any statute of limitations issues was

requested from Seattle

in April, 1998.

On 1/28/1999 AUSAL

advised that he has spoken

with appropriate DOJ officials.

These conversations have caused

him to conclude that "the statute of limitations is infinite" in

this matter. AUSA

further advised that a written legal

brief will be forthcoming to this effect.

This is consistent

with prior opinions from DOJ and the United States Attorneys

Office.

The continuing need to automate at least the list of

suspect names in this file was also discussed in April, 1998.

was determined that this task would be held in abeyance pending

the USA's review, or time available by the support staff.

April, it is estimated that this list has needed to be manually

searched by SAl

other Divisions.

As there are over 1100 names, considerable

Agent time was required to perform these searches, and the result

is imperfect. These inquiries continue. NORJAK manual indices

are incomplete and not easily accessible. It was estimated by

Squad 5 rotor that one workday would suffice to automate these

names.

Although additional requests of the LAB may be made in

the near future concerning this case, most of the calls received

continue not to warrant

setting investigative leads.

The Associated Press

It's been 25 years since he took

that big step out of a Boeing 727 at

10,000 feet, yet tips on D.B. Cooper

still trickle in.

One of the most daring - or dumb-

est - criminals ever remains at large,

having either flouted the laws of so-

ciety or been foiled by the law of

gravity.

"It's still a pending investigation,"

says Seattle-based FBI agent Ray

Lauer, who adds that the case will

stay open "probably forever."

The FBI still stores 60 volumes of

interviews and other documents

telling how Cooper hijacked a jetlin-

er, demanded and received $200,000,

then jumped from the plane over the

Cascade Mountains of Southwest

Washington and into legend.

He hasn't been heard from since,

although $5,880 of his loot was found

by a boy playing on the banks of the

Columbia River in 1980.

WASHINGTON - In a note writ-

ten before his suicide in May, Adm.

Jeremy Boörda, then the Navy's top

officer, indicated that he was deeply

concerned about recent criticism of

the service and "couldn't bear to

bring dishonor" to sailors over ques-

tions about whether he had improp-

erly worn combat decorations.

The suicide note, published for the

first time in the December issue of

Washingtonian magazine, is consis-

tent with the official description of

the contents provided by the Navy

immediately after the 57-year-oid

chief of naval operations took his life.

It suggests that Boorda felt he was

under enormous pressure - in addi-

tion to the questions over the medais.

"Ib my sailors," he wrote, "I could-

n't bear to bring dishonor to you....

For those who want to tear our Navy

down, I guess I've given them plen-

lu to write about for a while. But I

will soon be forgotten.'

The Navy had declined to release

the text of the note. It is included as

part of a Washingtorian article by

Nick Kotz, a free-lance writer The

article noted that the Navy faced in-

tense scrutiny during Boorda's two

years at the top, including scandals

involving sexual harassment and

wrongdoing at the U.S. Naval Acad-

emy.

The temperature was 7 below zero,

Ralph Himmelsbach, the FBI

agent assigned to the case before

his retirement in 1980, has long

Synopsis:

To set lead for Special Projects Section to conduct

Enclosures:

Enclosed for the Special Project Section are two

color copies of a composite

sketch prepared by the Exhibits

Section,

Administrative Division, dated 1/2/1973, one depicting

subject

in dark glasses.

enclosed is a synopsis of

captioned event to include subject's physical description and age

as of the date of the hijacking, 11/24/1971.

Details: Above-referenced telcalls with SSA

Special Projects, has indicated that aging of these photographs

should be possible.

A review of the case subfile concerning this

sketch has determined that the original sketches were maintained

by the Exhibits Sections under Bureau file number 164-2111.

These sketches, although not the first prepared by the Exhibits

Section for this case, were determined to be the best likeness of

subject Cooper.

DOJ and the Seattle U.S. Attorney's Office have

recently.reaffirmed that the statute of limitations in this crime

is infinite due to hijacking being a capital offense in 1971.

Captioned matter remains the only unresolved hijacking in U.S.

history. It is anticipated that the original sketch and aged

sketch will receive nationwide media attention as several

networks, including ABC and the Discovery Channel are apparently

planning to once again run presentations on this case.

Facts of Complaint

Complainant called to advise that he was a co-conspirator in

the D.B. Cooper skyjacking incident.

The complainant knows where the

remaining $184,000 from the heist is located (allegedly in close

proximity to the Mt. Ranier area)

and is willing to arrange for its

return.

The complainant stated that he was closely associated with the

main subject, Cooper (allegedly a false name), and that he was the person

that was to pick Cooper up at the prearranged landing sight after he ll No

jumped from the plane.

The complainant claimed that the idea for the

skyjacking was, in fact, his.

After the skyjacking, the complainant recovered the bag with

the stolen money, took out approximately $16,000 and then buried the

remaining funds.

He spent part of the money in Carbonado, Washington,

The original jumping skyjacker, Cooper boarded a

Northwest Orient flight for Seattle on Thanksgiving Eve

in 1971. Once aloft he threatened to blow up the plane and

demanded $200,000 and four parachutes. After his

demands were met, Cooper ordered the 727 to take off

and then jumped from the rear of the plane somewhere

over Washington state. Despite exhaustive searches,

Cooper's body was never found and his whereabouts are

unknown.

Extra credit: The hijacker actually called himself Dan

Cooper; a law officer mistakenly described him to the

press as "D.B." and the name stuck.

SUBJECT: Forensic Case SI 679, FBI 00615033 GX, Seattle WA

Material submitted consists of one human cranium and one animal bone. The cranium is well

preserved, lacking soft tissue and apparently is filled with soil. The cranium is complete except for the

right zygomatic arch area and six teeth. These missing materials appear to have been lost perimortem or

not recent post-mortem, although the broken margin of the right malar shows some evidence of more

recent fracture.

The sex of the individual is difficult to determine reliably because of the attributes presented.

Metric analysis using Fordisc 2.0 indicated female sex, although the cranium is very robust.

Morphologically, the skull presents some characteristics of Asian ancestry, to include Native

American populations, and metric analysis with Fordisc 2.0 was inconclusive but indicated some possible

Asian ancestry.

The chewing surfaces of the teeth show extreme wear. Such extreme wear is unusual for a modern

individual but is expected in the dentition of an individual of archeological context.

The cranial sutures show minimal closure. This information coupled with observations on the

extent of dental formation, dental eruption, and general skeletal development suggests an age at death of

likely between 25 and 35 years.

In summary, this cranium presents characteristics suggesting an archeological origin. It likely

represents an individual of American Indian ancestry and considerable antiquity.

Suite 400, Crown Plaza Building 1500 Southwest 1st. Avenue Portland, Oregon 97201-5828

(503) 224-4181.

Please respond to the following questions.

1). Ref: The DB Cooper Case. Where in Clark County was the money found?

Reason for asking the question.

If DB made a night time water jump and drowned, by determining where along the Columbia River where

the money was recovered in Clark County, I would be able to bring in a trained cadaver dog and look for the

bone fragments remains of the "DB Cooper" case. Possibly locating more evidence for your agents.

What kind of parachute was he jumping? A PCMark111/or Delta? I know it was a specially made

competition chute. During this time period the only new Comp chutes were the Paracommander Mark

models and the Deltas. I don't believe the squares or strato clouds were made yet.

I need this information to figure glide/drop ratios. (I used to be a

with USPA).

Winds were reported from the west at 25MPH. A delta chute has a forward glide rate of approx. 18-25MPH.

A PCM111 12MPH glide ratio. Under canopy from 7,000 feet gives "DB" 6.30 minutes of glide time at

35MPH. (With the wind in his back). If he jumps over amboy and splashes down near CAMAS, figuring

water current speed, water temp, weight of chute, harness, suspect, money, he'll drift 1/2 mile unless

snagged underwater.

2). Does the FBi hire support K-9 Search staff? For finding evidence and victims?

Title:

NORJAK

Synopsis:

Request Bureau and Attorney General authority for the

offering of a $100,000 reward for specific evidence leading to

the resolution of this case. This was discussed between Seattle

SAC Charles E. Mandigo and Section Chief Andreas Stephens on

8/18/2000

Details: To summarize, this case involving the 11/24/1971

hijacking of Northwest flight 305 has remained the only unsolved

hijacking in U.s. history.

Seattle has processed well over 1100

subjects over the years and virtually every other field division

has also expended significant investigative resources. Other

than a small portion of the $200,000 ransom money being recovered

along the bank of the Columbia River,

near Vancouver, Washington

in February, 1980, no trace of the unidentified subject has ever

been found.

A recently updated prosecutive opinion received from

the Seattle USA's office and DOJ has continued to indicate that a

statute of limitations does not apply in this matter. At the

time of this crime, airplane hijacking was a capital offense in

the United States.

This hijacking, due to its singular nature,

certainly contributed to the acceleration of sweeping changes in

u.s. airport security and thus had a direct and long lasting

impact on the traveling public.

The hijacking of Northwest 305 continues to garner

media attention.

Seattle continues to receive numerous media

inquiries (about fifty in the past year alone). Pursuant to

recent requests from the National Press Office, Seattle

cooperated in the new production of a special on the History

Re: SE 164A-81, 10/10/2000

From: Seattle

and another soon to be

Learning Channel. In most of these media inquiries, the issue of

a reward is invariably raised.

Previous Rewards Offered

A $25,000 reward offered by Northwest Airlines in the

early 1970's was later withdrawn after the airlines was fully

reimbursed by its insurer, Royal Globe Insurance.

newspaper offered a $5,000 reward for one of the NORJAK $20 bills

until the offer was terminated in 1976. There has been no FBI

sponsored reward ever offered.

Timing and Benefit of Offering a $100, 000 Reward Now

As this case nears its 30 year anniversary, it is

likely that any associates or family members of the unknown

subject (as well as the subject himself, if alive) are in their

seventies.

With the passage of this amount of time it is

possible that any such person might be now motivated by such a

reward to come forward to resolve this matter. Additionally, it

is expected that this approaching anniversary will be the

appropriate time to make best use of likely additional media

interest. It is undoubtedly in the best interests of this case

not to discourage any person with positive and direct information

from contacting the FBI due to press accounts of a reward no

longer being available.

To avoid generating large quantities of "looks like"

Leads, any reward should be specific as to direct evidence or

knowledge that could resolve this case. Additionally, it is

anticipated that the fact of the existence of a reward, li

approved, will be provided to those inquiring, not contained in a

press release.

It is unlikely that Northwest Airlines would wish

to participate in a new reward at this time due to current public

relations considerations.

If someone were to come forward with information that

resolved this case, Seattle would, in any event, very likely be

able to justify the payment of a significant cash payment after

Approval of a reward now would enable seattle to use

approaches.

Mystery

FBI analysis showed

A skull discovered in an attic in

But it's anybody's guess who will

ultimately end up with the skull, un-

earthed in Klickitat County near

the Columbia River in the early '80s

and stored in the attic of a Cozad,

Neb., home.

The skull was examined last sum-

mer at the Smithsonian Institution

in Washington., D.C., where scien-

tists concluded that it in no way

could belong to the man who hi-

jacked a Northwest Airlines plane

and parachuted out over Cowlitz or

Clark County with $200,000 in cash.

There are at least two reasons:

It's the wrong sex and way too old.

The skull has been returned to

the FBI lab in Washington, D.C.

That Thanksgiving

Eve 1971

crime is the nation's only unsolved

skyjacking. The male perpetrator,

widely presumed to have died in the

jump, never was found, although

$5,800 of the cash was discovered

in the sand along the Columbia Riv-

er nine years later. But that's an-

other story.

As for the skull from Klickitat

County, Smithsonian scientists de

termined it belonged to an Ameri-

can Indian woman who lived and

died long before airplanes were

even invented, the FBI says.

REF: D. B. COOPER

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

SUITE 400

1500 SOUTHWEST IS AVENUE

PORTLAND OR 97201-5828

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

I HAVE SEEN THE RE-ENACTMENT OF THE "SKY JACKING" BY THE MYSTERIOUS "D. B. COOPER" A

NUMBER OF TIMES OVER THE YEARS.

EACH AND EVERY TIME I SEE THE ARTIST'S SKETCH OF THE PERPETRATOR, 1 AM REMINDED OF A MAN

WHO LIVED HERE IN COLUMBUS YEARS AGO.

_NR

HIS NAME:

b6

b7C

HE WAS LIVING IN COLUMBUS, OHIO DURING AT LEAST PART OF THE 1960'S. HOW LONG BEFORE

OR HOW LONG AFTER, I DON'T KNOW.

HE WAS MARRIED 7O A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF

DURING SOME OF THIS TIME BUT I

UNDERSTAND THEY WERE DIVORCED.

AS ¡ INDICATED, THE ARTIST'S SKETCHES RESEMBLED HIS FACIAL FEATURES. HE WAS ABOUT 6'2" OR

SO AND PROBABLY WEIGHED ABOUT 180 TO 190 LBS.

HE HAD SEVERAL HUNDRED PARACHUTE JUMPS TO HIS CREDIT AND WAS A PILOT. HE HAD SERVED IN

KOREA AS A SMALL PLANE RECONNAISSANCE PILOT. HE WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT AIR

CURRENTS, PLANES SPEEDS, AIR AT CERTAIN ALTITUDES, ETC.

HE WAS A DETERMINED TYPE AND SOMEWHAT FORWARD. HIs I.Q. MOST LIKELY WAS NOT TOO HIGH,

PROBABLY 140-150. HE WAS A VERY CONFIDENT TYPE PERSON WHO MIGHT UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF

HIGHJACKING A PLANE. HE WOULD HAVE MADE PLANS SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

INCIDENT. HE WOULD BE VERY NEARLY THE CORRECT AGE.

SOMETIME DURING THE 1960'S, PROBABLY DURING THE LAST HALF, FE MOVED TO CAUFORNIA, !

HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE DID THERE NOR DO I KNOW HOW LONG HE MAY HAVE STAYED. I DON'T

KNOW WHERE HE MAY BE NOW.

-IT-IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD HELP FROM A FRIEND BY THE NAME OF

WAS A PILOTTOO. HE WAS INTELLIGENT, QUIET, AND QUITE-METICULOUS ABOUT

## Page 345

ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK. HE WAS A LICENSED PARACHUTE RIGOR AND HE TOO HAD MADE

HUNDREDS OF JUMPS.

IF "COOPER" HAD ANY HELP ON THE GROUND

ACCOMPLISE.J

ACQUIRED A POSITION WITH THE|

WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL

TOURING THE

LATER 60'S.

BOTH OF THESE MEN WOULD HAVE HAD "THE GUTS" TO NEGOTIATE SUCH A SCHEME. AND AS FAR AS

I KNOW, NEITHER HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR LAW

ENFORCEMENT.

M I CANNOT SAYTHAT I KNOW THAT EITHER ACTUALLY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT, BUT

AS I SAID EARLIER, THE SKETCHES AND THE WAY THE SKY-JACKING WAS PERPETRATED, REMINDS ME

VERY MUCH OF

_WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN ABOUT AND

ABOUT ORSO.

called to report that about two years after the 1971

skyjacking,

he and three friends were fishing on Rife Lake near Mossy

Rock, Washington. He advised that he hooked a box about fourteen inches

square, tied in both directions with what appeared to be white nylon

rope. As they attempted to pull the box into the boat his line broke and

the box sunk to the bottom of the lake. At that point by the lake,

the

shore line consists of a cliff and other land that is very rugged.

reported that one of his friends noticed what appeared to be a parachute

in a tree by the cliff.

The next day he went to the Lewis County S.O. and

He stated that they just ignored him or didn't

take him seriously.

'D.B. Cooper' pilot dies; William Scott

never talked much about 1971

skyjacking

By Susan Gilmore

Seattle Times staff reporter

For 30 years, William "Scotty" Scott said little about the

world's most famous skyjacking, shunning assorted authors

and movie producers who came knocking at his door

Mr. Scott piloted the Northwest Orient Airlines jet hijacked by

he infamous "D.B. Cooper" on Thanksgiving Eve 1971. H

died of prostate cancer Sunday at his home in Green Valley

Ariz., taking to the grave much of what he knew about that

"When he came home that night," she said, "he told his family

about it, and that was the end of it. He was a very quiet man.

Very reserved."

Only in recent years had he begun to talk about the skyjacking

that perplexed the FBI and continues to rivet those who thin

Cooper may have survived the jump of 10,000 feet into th

blackness of a storm over Southwest Washington.

Her husband was convinced Cooper died in the leap, said

Frances Scott. "He felt he jumped into Lake Merwin (Cowlitz

_ County) and got-tangled-up in dead.trees.and died," she said

On the 25th anniversary of the heist, Mr. Scott spoke to a local

pilots club; 200 people showed up, said his wife.

Mr. Scott was the captain of the Boeing 727 when a passenger

---=

under the name of Dan Cooper boarded in Portland for the

short flight to Seattle. Midway, he passed a note to a flight

attendant, saying he had a bomb and demanding $200,000.

Seattle Times: Search Result

Page 2 of 2

When the plane landed in Seattle, the other passengers were

evacuated, and the FBI gave the skyjacker the ransom money

and the four parachutes he had requested.

Cooper then ordered the pilot to fly toward Mexico, but he

jumped from the plane somewhere near the Columbia River.

Despite years of searching, all that has been found is $5,800

unearthed along the north bank of the Columbia.

Mr. Scott never saw Cooper. "He was intent on flying the plane

and being able to get people out of there alive and save the

aircraft for Northwest," said his widow.

Little by little, she said, her husband had begun to talk about it

the past few years. "It was good for him," she said. "In later

years, he'd get mad at authors. Scotty would say, 'No, that's not

the way it happened' They weren't there; he was."

Title: NORJAK;

CAA - HIJACKING

Synopsis: To transmit recovered possible parachute to the

Laboratory for analysis.

For reference, the BUfile is 164-2111.

Package Copy: Being forwarded under separate cover is one

apparent parachute (1B23) recovered from a bank of the Columbia

River.

Details: The above apparent parachute was recovered by

a resident of Washougal, Washington.

_advised that

in August 2000 he was in the Reed Island area of the Columbia

River with his family digging in the sand. This item, which

appears to be a parachute canopy, was recovered buried along the

waterline.l

provided this item to the FBI on August 2,

It was noted that the canopy is still very wet and

contains a large quantity of sand. During the review in Seattle

small green markings were noted on the canopy.

As Seattle has no facility to properly dry an item this

size, it was

packed in paper and is being provided in a wet

condition.

Of note, in February 1980, $5800 in currency identified

with this hijacking

was recovered from the Tena Bar area of the

Columbia River, just south of Vancouver.

A flow study

commissioned by the FBI at that time determined that the money

had likely been naturally deposited in that location and had

probably flowed down the Washougal River or one of its

tributaries.

The Washougal River empties into the Columbia

immediately down river (west) from Reed Island.
