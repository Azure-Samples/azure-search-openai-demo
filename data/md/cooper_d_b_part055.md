Attention Officer who spoke to the skyjacker.

There is something the brown makeup does not hidb.

It is the warts or moles on your skyjacker's face. One near the

nose, to more in the laughing lines near the mouth, also one or

two others in the other side of his face. You must have noticed

those. You can find the same moles or warts in Jack Linkletter's

face, a master criminal who must have been back in NewPort Beach

where he lives within the noxt four to five days. They do not have

to run anywhere, just put on a tuxedo and have a dinner with some

leaders of this nation.

his conversation with this individual he strongly suspects

the man may be the person connected with this crime.

recalled that he talked to this man for

approximately ten

to fifteen minutes concerning different

aspects of parachute jumping and during this conversation

the man asked several unusual questions. such as how would

one go about jumping out of jets.

specifically

recalls telling the man it .could

be done if the door of the

aircraft opened inward or if it had a rear stairwell that

couLd be raised and towered..

The man appeared interested

and they discussed this further, to the point where air

speed and drag was talked about.

The fact was brought up

that full flaps and lowered landing gear would supply the

drag needed to exit from a jet.

The man also asked l

where jump centers were

In addition,

they discussed altitude of jumps, but

who was thinking in terms of altitude recoras.

answered

in terms, implying world record altitudes, oxygen supply,: time

and distance of free fall.

also recalled the individual rather vividly

in his mind because he wore

"Cochrane"boots. He explained that

Cochrane boots are peculiar to military jumpers and are not

street shoes, tennis shoes, sandals and even barefooted, but

the Cochrane

boots were noticable because they are not used by

too many people...

He also stated he believed the man may have jumped

on several occasions at the Elsinore center. If he did, there

would be a registration card on file with

Elsinore Paricenter, Inc. He advised that

each person that jumps must fill out a registration card before

jumping, regardless of how much prior experience the person has

had elsewere.

These cards are maintained at Elsinore Paricenter.

on succeeding jumps, the cards are referred to 1f the individual

is not known, ana a

receipt for jump tickets is given to the

jumper with no name of lurther recording of the jump being made.

An individual with prior experience and a license issued by the

United States Parachute Association (USPA) would have the USPA

license number written on the registration card.

advised that USPA. records are maintained at •

USPA Headquarters,

care of Post Office Box 109, Monterey,

He pointed out that licenses issued by the USPA necessitate

that the applicant furnish a photograph of himself to USPA

Headquarters before the license is issued He was not sure if

a copy of the photograph was maintained In USPA files. He noted

that licenses: must be renewed each year.

advised he recalled this while studying the

Government memorandum containing the description of the man who

hijacked the aircraft on November 24, 1971. He further advised

that he doubted that the man he talked to belonged to any para-

chute or jumping clubs inasmuch as the average age of jumpers

Is between 25 to 28 years and they would not hang around with an

"old guy like that"

, and too because most clubs in California

have disbanded in the last year and a half.

Concerning clubs and their locations,

that they could be identified through the u.s.

he has reviewed his thoughts and is certain he can

narrow the time span to the middle or late part of

August 1971 when this conversation occurred.

He still

believes it was strange that a person would

ask questions

about jumping out of jet aircraft and discuss air speed

then have something like the hijacking that occurred

later. He also stated that it may

be coincedental but he saw an advertisement on pages

46 and 47 of Look magazine dated August 24; 1971 showing

a parachutist jumping out of a jet aircraft. le stated

this nay have stimulated questions by soneone seeing this

advertisement, however, he is

still concerned sinco the

individual he

spoke to resembles the artist's conception

of the hijacker.

He does not know the name of the man

he talked to and has not seen him since.

He did state

he believes he would recognize the man if he sees him

On 12/10/72, flicht records for the month of

August 1971 were photographed at the Elsinore center.

these

records contain the last names of the jumpers, the altitude

from which they jumped, the name of the pilot and the date.

Review of these flight records on 12/14-15/71 re-

voaled that the last names on these records matched thirty

one individuals whose descriptions matched

hijacker and junped from the Alsinore center during the

month of August 1971. It was noted that the last name on

the flight record does

not mean thas the jumper was the

person woose refistration card was pulled

It should also be pointed out that there were 29,140

parachuie juuns made fror the Ilsinore center during üh

year 1970.

Phe total number or jumps at the center for

the year 1971 exceeds

last gear's total and will be in

excess of 30,000 this year.

On 3.2/25/71, C

picked out eight of

the remainine thirty one cards stating he personally knows

these individuals and they do not ronotely resemble the

artist's conception. The renaining twenty three cards

represented individuals

does not know on the name

familiar but he could not recall what the nan looked

like.

On 12/20/71,

roviowed the remaining registration cards and eliminated

eicht more based on personal knoledge of the individual

and the fact they are known to the center and do not re-

semble the artist's conception. .

Pollowing are the recistration cards from the

Elsinore center bearing the name, address and telephone

number of jumpers who are unknown to

and/or the

DISSEMINATION

MEMORANDUM

00: SEATTLE

12/21/71

NORJAK

Shortly after 3:00 p.m., PST, 11/24/71, a lone white

male traveling from Portland, Oregon,

to Seattle, Washington,

on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, displayed the contents

of his briefcase to a stewardess indicating to her it was a bomo

which would be exploded unless his demands were met.

The hijacker

indicated his willingness to exchange the safety of the 36

passengers and crew for $200,000 in cash and four parachutes.

He instructed that the plane circle the Seattle Airport until his

demands were met, at which time the plane landed. Once the money

and parachutes were loaded and the plane was being refueled,

the hijacker allowed the passengers and two airline stewardess

to deplane, leaving a flight crew of three males and one female

and the hijacker aboard.

The hijacker indicated

a desire to fly

to Mexico City and instructed the plane to take

off flying at a

low altitude and slow speed, maintaining a southerly direction.

Upon demand, the hijacker was instructed on lowering the rear

passenger door while the aircraft was in flight. He was last seen

In the aircraft by crew members at 8:05 p.m., PST, when he

instructed the hostage stewardess to go forward to the first class

section and close the curtains behind her. Prior to departing

from passenger cabin, hijacker told stewardess the money bag was

not in accordance with instructions and to cut up one of the

parachutes to rewrap the money, which was done.

When the aircraft

Landed at Rendo, Nevada, for refueling, the hijacker, two para-

chutes, the ransom

money, and the vinyl briefcase had disappeared.

Investigation determined that the hijacker had purchased

his ticket at the Portland Airport shortly before the plane's

departure. Upon arrival at Seattle, all passengers were accounted

for except a white male using the name DAN COOPER. There were

no sky marshals aboard this flight and at no time did subject

Sirs,

I knew from the start that-I wouldn't be caught.

•I didn't rob Northwest Orient because I thought it

would be romantic, heroic of any of the other euphemisns

that seem to attach themselves to situations or high

risk.

I'm no modern day Robin Hoca, Unfortunately do have

only 14 montha to live.

My Ilfe has been one of hate, turmoil, hunger and more

hate, this seemed to be the fastest and most profitable

way to gain a

few fast srains of peace of mind.

I don't blame people for hating me for what I've done

nor do I blame anybody for wanting me to be oaught and

punished, though this san never happen:

Here are sore (not all) of the things working against

the authorIties:

I'm not a boasting man

I left no fingerprints

I wore a toupee

wore putty make-up

They could add or subtract fron the composite a hundred

times and not come up with an accurate description; and

we both know it.

I've come and gone on several airline flights already

and am

not holed up in some obsure baokwoods town.

Neither am I a psycho-pathic killer. As a matter of

faot I've never even received a speeding ticket.

Thaik you for your attention.
