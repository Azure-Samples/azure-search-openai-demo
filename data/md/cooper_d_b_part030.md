THE CRIME

A lone white male boarded Northwest Orient

Airlines Flight Number 305 at Portland, Oregon, on

Novembeth

.24, 1971. At approximately 3:22 p.m., while

the flight was en route to Seattle, Washington, he

indicated to a stewardess that his briefcase contained a

bomb which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36 passengers

aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seatlte,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes and money, the hijacker

allowed all passengers and two of the airline stewardesses

to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into

the first-class section of the aircraft and informed them

he desired to fly to Mexico City. The hijacker instructec

that the plane proceed in a southerly direction and fly at

a low altitude and slow speed which enabled the rear door

of the plane to be opened during the flight.

It is to be noted by Honolulu that the enclosed

photographs with and without glasses are the latest composites

completed by the Bureau

likenesses by witnesses in instant matter. However, the

enclosed photographs have not at this time been disseminated

Bureau wide and until this is done no publicity should be

afforded to the photographs.

Long red, ashington, advised $A THOMAS S. MANNING

that hế recently returned from Kauai, Hawaii, and during his

time on that island stayed at the Kauai Resorts Hotel.

About

5 p.i. on February 6, 1973, he was in a lounge at that location

where a rock band was practicing. He noticed a white male

sitting at a table and they began to speak about the noise of

the band.

bill used in the Seattle "Flag" article is identical with

the $20 bill recently obtained fron Secret Service, who

in turn obtained it from a local Seattle service station.

This $20 bill was

passed by

a white female who apparently

did not know of the alteration that had been made to it.

The last three digits in the serial number have been changed

by cutting out three digits from a $1 bill and inserting

them into a $20 bill, using scotch tape.

This $20 bill will be retained in the lA section

of the Seattle file 164-81.

A release of an interim composite (one that had not been

SUBJECT: NORJAK

During a recent conversation with sAl

Vancouver RA a discussion re captioned matter dwelt on other

hijackings where the subject made dry runs on the same aircrart

for purposes of perfecting his plan of hijacking.

In line with this matter it is felt that a logical lead,

uniess already explored,

would

be to make an attempt to secure

passenger flight manifests for a 30 day deriod prior

to the

hijack date in an attempt to determine where subject in

NORJAK did in fact make any trial runs to perfect his plan.

It is entirely possible that through this medium information

could be developed concerning the NORJAK subject.

Memorandum

TO

FROM : SA THOMAS J. MANNING

DATE: 3/30/73

Sus E

SUBJECT: NOR JAK

Upon cessation of the most recent terrain search in Clark

County, Washington it is felt that the following comments are

pertinent since they come from one individual who has partic.

ipated in every search operation which have a total time

expenditure of aproximately 9 weeks.

The search conducted by the United States Army was the best

effort which could be expended considering the number of personnel

involved, logistic and support problems, weather and terrain

factors.

This is pointed out by one speaking from actual

experience,

intimately acquainted with details of the various

searches, since there

appears to have arisen some question on

the adequacy of the military searche

The searches conducted by Agent personnel were also the best

effort which could he but forth considering the same problems

mentioned above.

The most recent search appears to have been based upon the

securing of

new data which corrected the most logical spot at

which the hijacker exited from the aircraft, which resulted in

the moving of what has been referred to in past communications

as point A.

However no concrete information has been develoded

that the parachute of the hijacker did not open and the renewing

of the search of the terrain at new point A appears to have

been based on mere conjecture that the chute did not in fact

deploy.

In view of the above it is respectfully and earnestly

recommended that absent concrete information concerning the

hi jacker or evidence in this matter being in the searched or

unseached terrain that no further terrain searches be

undertaken. It is felt that to do so would result in an

unwarranted expentiture of agent time and effort and an

expenditure of Bureau funds which is not economically feasible

or justified.
