Title:

NORJAK;

CAA- HIJACKING

Synopsis: To submit evidence for DNA analysis.

Package Copy: Being forwarded under separate cover is one

original airline ticket (1B21) and one snap on black tie with

gold tie clip (1B7) .

Enclosures: Original Laboratory reports regarding above items.

Details: As the Laboratory is aware, captioned case involves the

hijacking of Northwest flight 305 destined for Seattle on

11/24/1971 by an unknown subject. In spite of exhaustive

investigation over the years,

the subject remains unidentified.

This case has national significance and remains the only

unresolved airplane hijacking in U.S. history.

As this was a

capital offense at the time, no statute of limitation exists.

Retrieval of any DNA could be very useful as a DNA profile coulo

be used to eliminate subjects that are still being brought to the

attention of Seattle

The above items were originally submitted to the

Laboratory in late 1971 for fingerprint analysis (ticket) and

manufacture analysis (tie and clip)with negative results.

No DNA

testing was ever done. Prior reports from the LAB related to the

examination of the tie and clip are attached for reference. As

these are the only items absolutely known to have been handled by

the UNSUB in this case, they are being resubmitted at this time

foI DNA analysis.

If appropriate, and following the DNA work,

the ticket (1B21) should be also resubmitted for latents.

Synopsis:

To outline a three phase investigative plan concerning

evaluation of recent DNA profile.

Over thirty years, more than one thousand possible

subjects have been processed by Seattle with the assistance of

every Field Division. Most were quickly eliminated,

required extensive investigation to eliminate, while some

remained of interest and could not be included or excluded

To date, the hijacker of Northwest 305,

who parachuted from the aircraft in southern Washington on

11/24/1971 with the $200,000 ransom, has not been identified. As

airplane hijacking was a

capital offense at the time, DOJ has

recently advised that no statute of limitations exists. This

remains the only unresolved hijacking in U.S. history.

During 2001, advancements in sensitivity of DNA PCR/STR

testing reached a point that resubmission of an item believed

handled and worn py the UNSUs in this case was deemed worthwhile.

was advised that testing of this item (a black

necktief has resulted in recovery of male nuclear DNA, which has

been deemed suitable for entry into CODIS.

The subject was

Re: SE 164A-81, 08/20/2002

Due passage of time,

and the sheer number of subjects

evaluated in this case, special considerations are necessary to

effectively use these DNA results without generating large

numbers of

time intensive leads.

The following is a three phase

investigative plan that will be completed in the next 30-60 days:

Laboratory, DNAl, has been requested to submit the

CODIS profile to all 50

for checking against State DNA

databases.

Special attention will be provided to databases in

Oregon and Washington.

2. A comprehensive review of each subject subfile

(1,057 currently) will be conducted to identify those not

strongly eliminated at the time.

3. From those identified in phase two, leads will be

set to obtain DNA samples from the suspect, subjects children, or

other appropriate personal items belonging to him. The intent is

to be very selective with these leads.

It is anticipated that some of those contacted in phase

three will contact the media.

By Susan Gilmore

Seattle Times staff reporter

If you believe a persuasive San Diego cabdriver, D.B. Cooper was

a drifter and card player who died of a cocaine overdose in

California 15 years after skyjacking a Northwest Airlines jet

between Portiand and Seattle.

If you believe an equally insistent Florida realtor, D.B. Cooper was

her late husband, a chain-smoking ex-con who revealed his true

identity to her six years ago as he lay dying of kidney disease in a

Pensacola hospital.

And if you believe the FBI, the notorious skyjacker, after

parachuting out of the plane at 10,000 feet with a 21-pound satchel

of ransom money strapped to his chest, died in the jump. No

matter that his body has never been found.

Three decades later, the only unsolved skyjacking in the country's

history continues to fascinate mystery lovers, with many hoping the

passenger known as D.B. Cooper — who physically hurt no one,

except possibly himself - landed safely with the loot and got away.

"He's our Jesse James and Billy the Kid," said Jerry Thomas of

Jefferson County, a retired Army infantryman who has made it his

mission to scour the backwoods of Southwest Washington for any

sign of Cooper.

Even law-abiding Americans have a history of rooting for the

underdog, and "here's a little guy all by himself who reached up

and tweaked Uncle Sam's nose and took $200,000 from a major

corporation" and may have gotten away with it, said retired FBI

Agent Ralph Himmelsbach, who spent years searching for Cooper

and wrote a book about the case.

It almost doesn't matter if Cooper is dead; for 30 years, his legend

has lived on.

he Seattle Times: D.B. Cooper

A leap into history

7zle: The legend turns 30

On Nov. 24, 1971, a tall, dark-complexioned passenger identifying

himself as Dan Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 on a stormy

Thanksgiving Eve, demanded and got $200,000 and parachutes,

then jumped from the rear of the plane into history.

In recent weeks, as the anniversary has approached, television

crews from around the world have descended on Thomas, a self-

appointed Cooper expert, for his stories and a walk through the

voods where Cooper is believed to have landed. Maybe, just

naybe, Thomas would find a scrap of parachute, a human bone, i

waterlogged $20 bill.

Officially, the case remains open.

"The fact it's the only unsolved hijacking keeps it high-profile," said

FBI Agent Ralph Hope of Seattle, the latest in a list of agents in

charge of the case. "It will remain that way until we know the

individual could not be alive."

Though the FBI conducted major searches in 1971 and 1980,

collected 1,200 files and checked out countless leads, no hard

evidence ever turned up. Agents still receive a half-dozen inquiries

a month; most are simply filed away.

"There's a number of incidents where people looked very, very

good, but no direct evidence was located," Hope said. "Many will

read articles or books and call in with information, much of it

inaccurate. You can almost tell what books they read."

'I have a bomb'

Agents knew little about the

skyjacker except that he

drank whiskey, was familiar

cash for a one-way flight from

Portland to Seattle.

parachutes and ransom money paid by the airline. With

Cooper and the flight crew on board, it took off, heading

south toward Mexico. About 30 minutes later, a cockpit

warning light showed the rear stairway was fully extended.

The pilot asked over the intercom, "Is everything OK back

there?"

Cooper yelled back, "No," and bailed out the back into

freezing darkness.

The plane landed in Reno, where agents found nothing

except Cooper's skinny black tie, tie tack, eight of his

tingere butts ng the the newer hutes aed, possibly a

Did he survive? Said Hope: "We know there was a blowing

storm, the plane was going 170 knots, he was wearing

street clothes and street shoes. ... The chance of survival

was not good. Possible, not likely,"

Yet Cooper's body was never found, and only a portion of the

ransom money - whose serial numbers the FBI had

recorded - turned up when a child digging in a sand bar on

the north bank of the Columbia River west of Vancouver in

1980 unearthed a bundle of $20 bills.

That gives romantics room to fantasize that Cooper is alive,

enjoying his riches in some exotic locale.

But the San Diego cabbie and the Florida realtor have no

doubts. Not only are they certain Cooper survived the jump,

they insist they know who he was.

The cabbie's tale

The two men were poker-playing buddies. Sitting in a bar

one night in 1984, Rizzo said, he confided to Huddleston that

he was a fugitive wanted by the FBI for counterfeiting.

Huddleston replied with his own confession: He had

skyjacked an airplane in 1971.

Rizzo said he kept the secret until after Huddleston died in

1986 of an aneurysm brought on by a cocaine overdose at

age 52. Rizzo told the FBI his tale. An autopsy of Huddleston

revealed his legs were covered with scars, which Rizzo says

were caused by the jump from the plane.

Rizzo said Huddieston gave him this account:

After plunging from the plane, he landed near a river, in a

tree about 10 feet above the ground, where a sharp limb

punctured his knee and ribs. The weather was so bad his

shoes blew off, and ice and sleet coated his arms and back.

The strap that held the money tore, and that's how he lost

zzle: The legend turns 30

the packet later found by the child on the riverban. He

crawled to a cave and later hitchhiked to Portland, where he

spent months recuperating before eventually moving to San

Diego.

He hid the money until 1978, when he took it to an Indian

eservation in Montana to be laundered, When he returne

to San Diego, he kept it stashed in the taillight of an olc

Cadillac.

Because he was constantly fearful of running into someone

from the flight who would recognize him, he often changed

his appearance, growing a beard and shaving his head, then

growing a mustache and wearing a long ponytail.

Rizzo said Huddleston once said: "In the back of my mind,

one day I'll be sitting on a bus, in a bar, and look into the

face of the only person who could identify me. I'll see that

stewardess. I know she will never forget my face."

Huddleston told Rizzo he'd bought the airline ticket under

the name Don - his real middle name, not Dan - and was

amused that the FBI went searching for a Dan Cooper.

"He was a James Dean type, a daredevil," Rizzo said. "This is

not a story I could make up, but the FBI's never going to

prove it."

The real-estate agent's tale

She claims she found the remote spot near Battle Ground,

Clark County, where her husband, an insurance salesman

and ex-con, took her in 1979. At the time, all he told her was

that it was a sentimental journey for him.

It wasn't until 1995, when he was 70 and on his deathbed,

that he whispered to her, "I'm Dan Cooper."

Jo Weber had no idea what he meant, and he angrily blurted,

"Oh, let it die with me."

She has since uncovered a trail of stories, suppositions and

what could just be coincidences. Among them:

Composite sketches of Cooper resemble her husband, who

was a chain smoker. Because he'd served time for burglary

and forgery on McNeil Island when it housed a federal

enitentiary, he was familiar with the general area where

cooper is believed to have landed

He sometimes talked in his sleep, drenched in sweat. "I left

my fingerprints on the aft stairs," he mumbled. "I'm going to

When she asked him about it later, he was vague and

evasive,

he Seattle Times: D.B. Cooper

zzle: The legend turns 30

Jo Weber once röund an old airline ticket from Po-and to

Seattle in a box of records. She came across it a second time

when she was cleaning out clothes, but her husband said it

didn't mean anything, and the ticket got lost again.

"I've offered to do anything I have to to prove I'm telling

the truth," she said. "Now, I have to let God take care of the

rest. I've given it five years of my life ... but I'm not going to

use up the rest of my life trying to do the FBI's job for

them."

Investigations 'just burn out'

The FBI has investigated a litany of stories like those from

Rizzo and Weber but rejected them because there is simply

no proof, Hope said. Except for the sodden bills along the

columbia, the forests have held Cooper's secret.

"Every so often one would come along, and I'd get the rush

of adrenaline," said Himmelsbach, the retired FBI agent and

author. "There's a guy in a bar with a bunch of $20 bills, he's

limping on one leg and someone asks where he got the roll,

and he says he might of hijacked an airplane. You track

those things down, and they just burn out."

Another who discounts Weber's deathbed confession is

Thomas, the retired Army infantryman who has spent the

past three decades searching the thick forests of Southwest

Washington for signs of Cooper.

"There's no way," said Thomas, 50, a survival expert. "... A

lot of what (Jo Weber) is claiming came right out of a book."

Thomas pulls out a well-worn map and traces the forests

around Washougal, Clark County. This, he believes, is where

Cooper's remains rest.

But he is willing to entertain the notion that Cooper

survived, so he walks the woods, sometimes with his

grandchildren, searching for signs under branches and along

creek banks.

"Unsolved cases really intrigue me. This is my life," Thomas

said.

Some clues still kept secret

When Cooper commandeered the Northwest jet, skyjacking

was hardly a novel crime. More than 25 were attempted in

1971 alone, but he alone did not get caught.

The following year, screening devices became mandatory in

airports, and Himmelsbach said exit doors on airliners were

modified with a device named the Cooper Vane so they could

not be opened in midflight.

The FBI won't talk about suspects in an open case. But

zzle: The legend turns 30

agents say they have kept some of their clues secret in

hopes of someday solving the mystery. "There's stuff we

know nobody else knows," Hope said.

The small town of Ariel, Cowlitz County, where some think

Cooper landed, hosts an annual Cooper celebration; this year

there will be no one parachuting from the sky because of

security concerns over a nearby dam. After 30 years, the

event still draws a crowd.

"It's that desperado mystique," said local historian Walt

Crowley of the story's enduring fascination.

"It was an extraordinary audacious act to lower that rear

gangway in flight and jump into a dark and stormy night,"

Crowley said. "He didn't hurt anybody ... and we all love a

mystery."

Re:

Hijacking of Northwest 305

Dear Special Agentl

I am in receipt of and thank you for your letter dated December 10, 2002, regarding the above

referenced matter. The information detailed in my letter dated August 29, 2002, came to be known

to my client through a mutual acquaintance with who is believed to be the hijacker of NW 305

commonly referred to in the media as "D.B. Cooper." My client has never personally spoken with

"Mr. Cooper" but does believe the information which can be delivered is accurate and specific in

nature to the extent that it would lead to location of "Mr. Cooper."

Again, the nature of the information known to my client is detailed in my previous letter. My

client is willing to meet with representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but has

legitimate concerns regarding maintaining his confidentiality, as well as desires more meaningful

and detailed discussions regarding the available reward in the event the information provided is in

fact accurate and leads to the arrest of "Mr. Cooper."

With the Christmas holidays upon us, I will maintain unusual office hours at best through the

end of the year. Special Agent

is familiar with me and has the ability to contact me as

needed. Please feel free to contact me atl

With kind personal regards, I am

Special Agent_

Federal Bureau of Investigation

1110 Third Avenue

Seattle, WA 98101

Dear Agent

I am an attorney in Maine. Several years ago a client of mine came to me with

evidence that|

had committed a number of crimes a good many years ago.

The evidence was significant but not conclusive, so I began a private investigation in

conjunction with some forensic experts and a private investigator from one of the major

investigative agencies in the country. We have proceeded cautiously, not only because of

possible danger to my client, but also to protect the reputation of the man in question,

in case we are mistaken. (The man is well respected and has no criminal record.)

Some time after beginning our investigation, a new and unexpected development

occurred. We learned of evidence pointing to the possibility that the man in question may

have committed another crime, one unconnected to any of those we had been investiga-

ting. This was the famous (or infamous) D. B. Cooper skyjacking.

Let me say right off that we view this possibility as a long shot. We do not

have any evidence directly connecting him to the skyjacking. Nevertheless, there are a

number of factors that make us believe he is a bona fide suspect. I will summarize some

of them for you on the pages accompany this letter, where we refer to the man in question

simply as "X." Again, this summary is not intended to prove that our suspect committed

the skyjacking, but simply to demonstrate that he bears further investigation.

When this possibility first came to our attention, we reviewed all the information

available to the public on the case. We then made some efforts to locate

the flight attendant who had a good deal of contact with Cooper during the skyjacking.

When we were unable to do so (the last we were able to learn was that she had left a

in Oregon), we let our efforts on the case lapse and returned to our

original concerns. It seemed to us that even if our suspect were guilty of the skyjacking

our chances of arriving at any definite conclusion were remote.

## Page 86

Recently, however, we learned that there may be DNA-related evidence in the

Cooper case. We should have thought of this before, as certain objects that Cooper came

in close contact with (such as a glass he drank from and cigarettes he smoked) could still

be kept in an evidence room. In recent years quite a few old crimes have been solved with

the aid of DNA technology. And in fact, since the other crimes we were investigating

were also old crimes, we had made the effort to obtain DNA material from our suspect,

without his being aware of it. From my client, we obtained some handkerchiefs with the

man's blood on them and have had both nuclear and mitochondrial profiles done by a

private lab, Orchid Cellmark. We also have a full set of the man's fingerprints.

I then contacted

whose book we had read.

I discussed the case with him, and asked him if it was possible that there was DNA

evidence in the Cooper case, and he said he thought there was. This was vital to me, as I

don't think it would be possible to prove or disprove our suspect's guilt on any other

basis than hard physical evidence. I don't want to waste my time or yours pursuing mere

theories or possibilities.

Igave me your name as the case agent in the Cooper case and

encouraged me to contact you. I thought I would write you first, to give you some

background on this matter. I will try to contact you by phone sometime next week in the

hope that we can discuss the matter further.

As mentioned, the odds that our suspect is guilty of the Cooper skyjacking are

small, but nevertheless they are not negligible. With the recent developments in forensic

technology, perhaps we have a real possibility of resolving this case. I look forward to

going into the matter further with you.

Reasons To Suspect "X" in the Cooper Skyjacking

Appearance

X's physical appearance (height, weight, age, facial appearance) is compatible

1971, but looked somewhat older (in their 30s, some men still look boyish, others look

b6 !

b7C

Behavior

Cooper's behavior has been described as cool and calm, and also (when it was

necessary) as commanding and authoritative. But in the latter case, he was firm and polite

rather than abusive (one of the stewardesses said he was more of a gentleman than many

regular passengers she had encountered). He became impatient at times, but only (and

only to the extent) that it was appropriate under the circumstances to get his way. In

short, he was in full control of himself in very difficult circumstances.

X is very self-disciplined. Both in the military and in civilian life he was used to

being in command and directing other people in order to accomplish missions or projects.

When he was in the military, a colonel who headed a high-pressure unit once remarked

publicly that of all the people he had known in the military, X was the only one who

never became rattled in a crisis.

Also, as a leader and by personal temperament, X is a very careful and thorough

planner, one who thinks through all the angles and contingencies of any project he leads

or undertakes. But unlike some people, who are strong at planning but not at acting, X

can be very bold and decisive in action. He has always had a strong interest in physical

activities that involve risk, for example, hang-gliding, whitewater kayaking (in the [

in Idaho),

because of its dangers). He is bold and in a quiet way

something of a show-off, but never reckless. He takes chances, but only well-calculated

ones.

1.

DB Cooper-21700

## Page 88

Background and Skills

Although he was not a career military officer, X served in the military -- in the

Air Force -- during the He was familiar with Boeing 727s, with their rear steps

that could be lowered from the inside, as these were used in Vietnam at the time he was

in the Air Force.

X learned to fly when he was in the Air Force, and ever since then he has had a

private pilot's license and has continued to fly.

X learned to fly when he was at [

7 in northern California,

and would have been familiar with other bases on the West Coast (such as McChord

near Seattle). He had visited Portland, and in flying would have used aviation maps of

the region. Thus, the whole locale of the skyjacking would have been familiar to him,

not only personally but technically.

* did not take parachute training or jump when he was in the Air Force, but later

in civilian life (still in the 1960s) he learned to skydive and became proficient at it (as he

does in most things he undertakes).

X became familiar with the woods when he was a young boy. He did a lot of

long-distance hiking with his father in rugged terrain (the Smoky Mountains). Later, after

being an Eagle Scout, he was accepted into a little-known, more advanced Scouting rank

called the Order of the Arrow. (To achieve this rank, you had to undergo a wilderness

survival test, in which you were given a compass, one match, and an egg, and nothing

more, and were left in a remote area of the woods; you had to spend the night alone in the

woods, cook the egg, and then find your way out unaided.) He has remained familiar with

being in the woods ever since. He is very self-reliant.

X also has good knowledge of chemistry and explosives.

Opportunity

At this time, more than 30 years after the crime, we cannot reconstruct X's

whereabouts at Thanksgiving 1971. Because we have been investigating X with regard to

other unrelated crimes, we have developed an extensive time-line for him, going back to

the 1960s_

• is something of a pack rat and has always kept boxes of old records,

so we have been able to determine X's whereabouts on a significant percentage of past

dates. However, our records show nothing for the period from November 23-28, 1971.

himself, ostensibly to engage in one of his outdoor or wilderness sports (which

does not take part in). Thus, the four (or more) day Thanksgiving weekend in 1971 would

Motive

At the time of the Cooper skyjacking, * was in need of money. He was employed

and he earned enough for ordinary purposes, but the household operated on a budget.

It had become apparent for some time to_

that X was spending fairly substantial

amounts of money beyond what was accounted for in the budget, using various dodges

to take the money from other budgeted expenses..

This money problem resulted in rising tensions between X and

skyjacking (a crime she had heard about, but about which she knew little, mostly only

what she gathered from a movie she had seen back in the 1970s).

knowledge about a case then almost 30 years old. Since she now suspected him of having

committed other crimes in the past, this got her thinking, and she quickly remembered

two things.

First, back in the mid-1970s, she and

Jhad seen a movie about D. B.

Cooper. She had no particular interest in the movie, bul

was eager to see it

and so they went as soon as it came out. The only reason she remembers it is because of

the highly unusual reaction of

to the movie. His normal personality is

somewhat reserved, not much given to enthusiasm or emotional expression. But at this

reaction was so oversized and unusual that

movie, he was on the edge of his seat, his face aglow, laughing at all the jokes. His

remembers it much better than she

does the movie. But it never entered her mind at that time that he could have committed

the crime (or any crime). His reaction, taken by itself, might mean only that the movie

struck a chord with him or perhaps that, unknown to her, he was a D. B. Cooper "fan."

The second thing she remembered also occurred in the mid-1970s. She and L

lived in the eastern United States. During this time

announced on

one occasion that he would be in California on business for a few days and afterward

could drive up to Portland. He had been to Portland any number of times before, and

liked the city, but she had been there only once, and then only briefly. So he suggested

that she fly out to Portland to meet him, and to see the city, and then they could drive

home across the U.S., making it a vacation trip.

When she flew into the Portland airport,

met her and insisted on

giving her a full tour of the airport, as if it were one of the major tourist sites of the city.

It was a nice enough airport, but there was nothing distinctive about it: it was much like

airports in a hundred other metropolitan areas. Butl

was very enthusiastic

about showing it to her. This, like his reaction to the movie, was so peculiar that she

remembered it well, even years later. But at the time she made no connection between

this and the movie or the Cooper case. It was only in 1997, when it occurred to her that

he might have committed the Cooper skyjacking, that these two memories came together.

As odd as these occasions were, though, she did not put much weight on them.

More striking was an event that occurred on November 24, 1999. She and

had flown into Atlanta and rented a car to drive to North Carolina, for a Thanksgiving

] They had a long way to drive, but

trying to get out of Atlanta proved to be a nightmare. The holiday traffic in a city like

Atlanta would have been difficult at best, but it turned out that there had been a serious

truck accident along their route, and traffic ground to a halt. For a long time, they could

only inch along. As a result, X came to be in a really foul mood, one that threatened to

spoil the whole weekend, especially as they had not been looking forward to the weekend

anyway. (Asl

But then something happened. The

car radio was on, and without warning the news announcer suddenly said, "Do you know

what tonight is? Tonight is the twenty-eighth anniversary of D. B. Cooper." He explained

briefly who Cooper was and told a weak joke in tribute to him, and then went on to the

day's news. Immediately X's mood changed, and changed totally, though the traffic

remained horrible for some time. X immediately became very cheerful and upbeat, and

he remained "up," i.e., not just in a better mood but noticeably happier than normal, not

only for the rest of the drive but for the entire weekend. Though he never mentioned what

had been said on the radio, it was obvious that it had triggered a radical change of mood.

It also seemed that this was not the reaction of a mere "fan."

At this time

began to read about the case. Everything she read, from

Cooper's behavior to the phrases and expressions he had used, reminded her forcefully

She also realized that he had all the skills needed to carry out the

skyjacking, that he had had a motive to do so, and that he could have had the opportunity.

It was only because of this - and not because of the odd behavior of

mentioned above -- that we made an effort to locatel

As far as we know, X has never come even remotely close to being looked at by

the authorities, and there is no reason why he should have. He did not live in the North-

west at the time, he has no criminal record, he is steadily employed, married and well

respected, his outdoors and sports activities are low profile, often carried out on his own.

If he was Cooper, even his appearance would not be likely to arouse any suspicion. The

composite sketch could look reasonably like a lot of people and was probably circulated

mostly in the Northwest. And the addition of a hairpiece would itself make enough of a

difference to allay any recognition. As a result, it is only in circumstances like the

present, where someone knows the suspect intimately, that suspicion and discovery is

likely to occur.

Dear Agent

I appreciated the opportunity to taik with you recently about a man I believe is a

bona fide suspect in the Cooper skyjacking case.

You asked me to provide the man's military record, a photo of him about the time

of the skyjacking, and a current photo, as well as his birth date and Social Security

number. All of these are enclosed with this letter.

While I'm at it, let me add two or three brief comments.

First, the record that the military provided doesn't state where our suspect was

assigned, except indirectly. In fact, he served his two full years at Travis Air Force Base

north of San Francisco, where he worked

Second, as mentioned, our suspect is a

This caused us to have

doubts for some time. To put it simply, we didn't think al

would commit crimes, at

least major crimes unrelated to his profession. But we had good reason to suspect him in

a number of cases, so we contacted L

7who once

worked in the FBI's profiling unit at Quantico

Jassured us, on the basis of his

knowledge and experience, that it was perfectly possible for a successful professional to

also commit major crimes. A sociopathic criminal, he said, can be quite functional and

successful in normal life, and can seem very straight and normal to those who know him.

Finally, I just want to add that any inquiry into our suspect should be done

carefully, so that nothing gets back to him. We regard him as a potentially dangerous

individual and

would be at risk if he should learn that he was being investigated.

Again, thank you for your consideration. I look forward to talking with you again.

Sincerely,

Suypers:

Dear Agent|

I got the message you left on my answering machine regarding the suspect whose

photos I sent you. I appreciate your prompt response.

You said the suspect could not be Cooper as Cooper was not balding. In all

probability, you're right about this. Of course, I knew from the composite pictures that

Cooper did not appear to be balding, or to be disguised in any way. But I thought that it

would be natural for a skyjacker who knew he would be observed at length to disguise

himself in some way. In particular, if he was a man who was balding across the top, he

would want to wear a hairpiece to conceal this fact. And he would want it to look natural,

as some better quality hairpieces can if they are carefully applied. It would just be a

matter of careful planning.

Nevertheless, I agree that this possibility is pretty small. And we have no direct

evidence tying our suspect to the crime. As you said, it is a matter of conjecture, though

the conjecture is based on our suspect's skills and the fact that we have had him under

investigation for other crimes. But obviously this doesn't warrant the expenditure of the

Bureau's resources in investigating him any further.

Nevertheless, I will enclose with this letter a copy of a DNA profile done on our

suspect. If there is a DNA profile done on Cooper, now or in the future, all I ask is that

the two be compared. That should take hardly any time or effort. And while it's very

unlikely for there to be a match, it's not beyond the realm of possibility. For a minimal

effort, there is the possibility of a big payoff.

Again, thanks for your consideration and your timely response.

Sincerely,

Agent in charge,

The D.B. Cooper skyjacking case of November 1971, to my knowledge has never been resolved. I believe

that this data package, if followed up, may enable that closure. My interest in the case started when I was

transferred to Seattle in June of 1972 and the D.B. Cooper sensation was still very much in the news. In

addition, the story of the Falcon and the Snowman was released a short time later and I was employed in

an environment similar to that of the story. I did not relate the stories at that time.

When I saw the picture (attached) in our local paper of[

I it rang a very loud bell in my

The Crime

On 11/24/1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a lone

White male boarded Northwest Orient flight 305 at Portland,

At approximately 3:22 p.m.

while the flight was en

route to Seattle, washington, he indicated to the stewardess that

his briefcase contained a bomb, which would blow up the plane

unless his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000.00 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and two airline

stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into the

first class section of the aircraft and informed them he desired

to fly to Mexico City. The hijacker instructed that the plane

proceed in a southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and

speed, which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere between

Seattle and Reno, Nevada, where the plane landed to refuel.

It

determined the hijackex, two parachutes and the ransom money

had disappeared when the plane was inspected at Reno.

Original artist's conception drawing of the aircraft

hijacker were prepared by the FBI Exhibit Section and are

considered a reasonable likeness.

The more recent aged composite

was prepared to depict what the hijacker might have looked like

in 1999.

The hijacker was described as follows:

means.

To date, the hijacker of Northwest 305, who parachuted

from the aircraft with the $200,000 ransom, has not been

identified.

This case remains the only unresolved airplane

hijacking in U.s. history.

Although it is very likely that the

hijacker did

not

survive the

jump, it

remains a possibility. If

currently alive, the hijacker would likely be in his mid-70's.

As hijacking was a capital offense at the time, DOJ has recently

again advised that no statute of limitations exists.

For the information of VCMOS and receiving offices, a

recent resubmission of an item connected to the UNSUB has

resulted in recovery of male nuclear DNA. This DNA was suitable

Ior entry into CODIS and for identification and elimination.

Seattle has identified the below individuals from which a DNA

sample is desired to process

a comparison.

A review is being conducted in Seattle to identify

possible candidates for DNA comparison. It is anticipated that

only a very small minority of the original suspect pool will

qualify for this DNA project.

Phase II of this review involved

the completed review of subject subfiles 1-500.

Due to the extensive and counterproductive media

coverage that, in some cases, may result from these

offices are requested to exercise discretion in dealing with

these leads. Some of these suspects may have known they were

on have know to wore, a22

considered a person of interest, others may not.

Likewise the

families may, or may not be aware. In cases where the suspect is

alive, oral

swabs should be solicited.

In cases where the

subject is deceased, all methods to include hair from shavers,

brushes, salvia from postage stamps, etc. should be considered.

in those cases where recovery of these items are not possible,

obtain proper death and burial'

records. Contact Seattle case

agent before asking family members for any exhumation authority.

In the event the suspect, and/or family, cannot be located,

receiving offices should set out appropriate leads to follow un

with an information copy to Seattle.

Obtain samples by one of the following methods, in the

following

order of priority:

All family or possible suspects contacted should be

advised that this is merely another investigative step following

advancement in technologies. No mention of the recovery of DNA

evidence should be made. Care should be given so persons

contacted are not lead to believe that they or their family

member are a suspect of great interest in this case. Unless

specifically requested in lead, no interviews are needed at this

Richard Floyd McCoy JI. (deceased) (SUB 386) •

SSN 237-66-3779

**CAUTION SUGGESTED**

**Family may be uncooperative**

McCoy was convicted of a copycat hijacking of a United Airlines

flight in April, 1972 in which he successfully parachuted from

that flight over Utah with $500,000.

McCoy was

arrested/convicted of that offense and most of the hijack

proceeds were recovered. McCoy later escaped from prison and was

shot and killed in November, 1974 after drawing a weapon on EBI

Agents attempting his arrest in Virginia Beach, Virginia. McCoy

never claimed to have been COOPER, and there was significant

differences in methodology between the two crimes. Evidence

indicated McCoy was in Salt Lake City on 11/25/1971, and had

possibly attended class at BYU on 11/24/1971. Some evidence

exists that McCoy and his wife actually drove to Las Vegas on

11/24/1971. Although the weight of the evidence points toward

the elimination of McCoy, speculation continued.

In July, 1972

McCoy allegedly told his Pre-Trial officer in Salt Lake City

prior to his receiving a 45 year sentence for the UAL hijacking,

that he had done "another one". In light of some contradiction

in evidence concerning McCoy, and the possibility that the

differences

• in methodology between the hijacking can be partially

explained as a possible natural refinement of methods, a DNA

sample is being sought.

It is recognized that McCoy's family may still be uncooperative.

Subject: Norjak/ Granite Productions request

UNCLASSIFIED

RECORD SE 164A-81

b6

b7C

Per your request, I will address each of the 13 items requested by Granite Productions. However, in general, and

in the past we have directed most inquiries of this nature to public source information that is everywhere on this

case. Much of it is not entirely accurate, but this helps us weed out people who claim first hand knowledge.

Many people have viewed such shows as the Granite Productions proposal and used it as a basis to claim their

husband/brother/etc. was Dan Cooper. Many people have submitted FOl requests. One FOl lawsuit is pending

now. The only exceptions to this strategy in my knowledge was for a two 'mainstream shows (i.e. History

Channel) in which we did live interviews. Even in those cases we never commented on the evidence we had, or

provided any documents from the case file. The tone was mainly Here is the crime, here is the artist conception

of the subject, the FBI still has an open case and will not stop looking to resolve this matter, etc". These

interviews were done at the express request of FBIHQ due to the national exposure possibilities. We agreed only

as it could benefit the case.

I believe we must treat this as any other pending FBI investigation with regard to release of information.

With regard to the specific requests from Granite Productions:

1. Flight Data from FAA and other sources concerning flight path: I know of no instance in which this was

provided or discussed with anyone outside of LE. Suggest referring them to public reported sources.

2. Archive film footage of an experiment with the NW 72; after the hijacking. This was provided to Unsolved

Mysteries/History Channel, a decision expressly made by SAC Mandigo due to the credible nature of the

production and request from FBIHQ, an is also not evidence. I see no harm to the case to providing this tape,

other than the precedent set and us having to provide another tape to everyone who claims news affiliation, with

no benefit to the case or FBI. We are not providing the tape under pending FOl requests.

3. Map and area searched by FBI. This should not be provided and has not been provided to my knowledge.

4. "Psychological Profiling" conducted by the FBI. Information of this sort has not been discussed. The photo

and aged composite that i had done in 1998 can be provided.

5. Copy ofFBI.wanted.poster_Refer them to public sources. There was an informational flyer sent out to

hünters, and another to-LE, 30-plus years.ago.-

ô. Details about the discovery of the 727 aft stairs placard: Refer them to public sources. This has been

reported in those sources.

7. Copy of document listing serial numbers of ransom bills. All the serial numbers were published in either the

Seattle Times or Pl at the time. No copies of this document (or an other from the case file should be provided).

Unsolved Mysteries asked for this and was also turned down.

8. FBI photographs of ransom money found at Tina's Bar near Vancouver in the early 1980's. The money found

6/23/2005

Message

Page 2 of 2

in February 1980 at TENA BAR (Not TINA's Bar) was photographed by news media and appeared in the paper

at the time. Refer them to public sources.

9. FBI photographs of search of Tena Bar. Press photos of the search appeared at the time. We should not

reiease any photos produced by the FBI.

10. Information about the condition of money that was found compared to the how the money had been

packaged when provided to COOPER. Details of the money as presented to COOPER contain useful holdback

details which should not be discussed. We can tell them that the serial numbers of the found money matched the

batch of bills given to COOPER during the hijacking.

11. Copy of the geologist report submitted to the FBI concerning the possible point of origin of the money found

at Tena Bar. This was a report commissioned by the FBI and is evidence. It should not be provided.

12. Documents pertaining to the investigation of R/chard McCoy. McCoy was a subject of a Salt Lake FBI case.

Intormation determined about McCoy cannot be provided by Seattle. McCoy's Salt Lake case is particulariy

sensitive as he was later shot by the FBi after having drawing a gun while being arrested for prison escape and

Bank Robbery. Recent attempts by the FBI Salt Lake have been made (at Seattle's request) to get cooperation of

family members.

13. Information about physical evidence recovered from VW 305. The FBI never provides information about

physical evidence recovered during a criminal pending investigation.

Please bear in mind that all of the above items have been sought repeatedly during a variety of

unsuccessful FOl requests. I don't think we can treat Granite Productions any differently that these

requestors, especially since there is no benefit to the case to do so. Otherwise a bad precedent would be

set, both for this case and for other old pending major FBI investigations.

Title: UNSUB,

aka DAN COOPER;

NORJAK

CAA - HIJACKING

Date: 07/13/2006

Synopsis: To set lead to Tacoma RA to interview unknown local

couple who are represented through

regarding

their knowledge about the case.

Enclosures: A case information sheet is enclosed. A copy of the

FD-71 dated 07/06/2006 taken by the Tacoma RA is also attached.

Details: The hijacker of Northwest 305, who parachuted from the

aircraft with $200,000 ransom, has

not been identified.

This

case remains the only unresolved airplane hijacking in U.s.

history.

Although it is likely that the hijacker did not survive

the jump, it remains

possibility. If currently alive, the

hijacker would be in his mid-70's. Hijacking was a capital

offense at the time and DOJ recently advised that no statute of

limitations exists.

Due to the extensive and counterproductive media

dealing with leads.

Tacoma should contactl

to facilitate the interview of the unknown couple.

DAYTON said that she did not do it for the money. DAYTON had

a hard life because of her sexual identity issues, so it was her

DAYTON had hidden a change of clothes near the farm

before the jump. After the jump, DAYTON put women's clothes on,

walked to Woodburn, and took a bus to Portland where her car was

dismantled and the buildings all torn down and disposed of

at a contaminated land fill. Dow Chemical Company was the

prime contractor at the time so it would be necessary to

check with their main office in Midland Michigan as they no

longer have an office in Colorado.

About the time of D.B. Cooper there was a young man who

worked with us at Rocky Flats nuclear plant between Golden

and Boulder Colorado. He was working in the engineering

office and was about 25 years old. His last name was

but I do not remember the first name. It should be easy

enough to get the first name from Dow Chemical Company

records.

One day he showed us a photo of his wife, all decked out in

those underwear type outfits they wear in Karate classes,

instructor and

went bonkers. As I remember he was

out on Colfax in Denver running across the street in heavy

traffic. There may be a police report of that incident in

either the Denver or Lakewood police offices depending on

how far West it was on Colfax.

He had recently finished a class on sky diving and gave us

some demonstrations on how much time you had to open your

reserve chute in case the main chute did not open. He had

also taken up with some girl who I believe was a daughter

of a professor at the college in Boulder.

His behavior was flaky after his wife left him that way. I

xemember him standing on top of a drafting board and using

an old ink well type pen to drop ink on a sheet of paper to

see if he could hit a certain spot. That is not the kind of

thing one would expect of a young engineering graduate. He

did not seem to care if he got a poor report concerning his

work activities.

PORTLAND, Ore. — The FBI is'

mysterious skyjacker Dan Coo-

about the man who bailed out of

an airliner in 1971 and vanished.

The man calling himself Dan

Cooper, also known as D.B. Coo-

in Portland for a flight to Seattle

on the night of Nov. 24, 1971, and

commandeered the plane, claim-

"Who was Cooper? Did he sur-

vive the jump? Were providing

new information and pictures

and asking for your help in solv-

ing the case," the FBI said in a

statement.

The FBI said that while Cooper

was originally thought to have

been an experienced jumper,

it has since concluded that was

wrong and that he almost certains.

ly didn't survive the jump in the

dark and rain. He hadn't specified

a route for the plane to fly and had

no way of knowing where ne was

when he went out the exit.

"Diving into the wilderness,

without a plan, without the right

equipment, in such terrible con.

agent Larry Cart said.

Several people have claimed to

be Cooper over the years but were

dismissed on the basis of physical

tie the skyjacker left on the plane.

In 1980, a boy walking near the

Columbia River found $5,800 of

bills. "Maybe a hydrologist can,

"Family" Wins Big Z Star Meet

by

Jerry Tyson

with photos by the Author

The first big star meet to be held outside of California

took place November

29 and 30, 1969 at Zephyrhills

Florida. Three ten-man teams competed and the "Family,

from Hinckley, Illinois, were the winners. The meet practically

never got off the ground. Originally scheduled for the Friday

and Saturday of Thanksgiving Day weekend, it suffered from

that rarity in Florida, a stalled front smack on top of

Zephyrhills airport that produced the following aerological

nonsensé: Thursday, November 27, low clouds, wind, rain

5500' max; Friday, November 28, same soup pius more rain;

Saturday, November 29, low clouds in the morning, chill

wind but a promise of a break at noon. It did break at noon

and the meet got rolling.

The Teams

It's hard to find a place in the U.S. that's farther away

from most any place else than Zephyrhills. It's even harder to

get jumpers to go such great distances for a meet. The odds

against getting 10 in a group to ante up the necessary travel,

entry fee, and expense money are phenomenal. In sponsoring

such a meet to further large star relative work, Jeff Searles

took an enormous chance on losing his shirt. Two months

before the meet he had verbal promises of as many as five

for the 10-man event plus several more for the

five-man event. The five-man event never got off the ground

and three teams showed for the 10-man: the "Family" from

Hinckley, Iil., a team from Taft, California and a pick-up

team from the Tampa-Zephyrhills area. Neither the "Family"

nor Taft arrived with a full quota, the "Family" picking up

three jumpers on the spot and Taft picking up two.

14

"Big Z" is one of the best places in the U.S. to have a star

meet. In regard to aircraft support it is the best place. On hand

for the meet, should they be needed, were the following; a

DC-3, a €-47, a Lockheed Electra (Like an overgrown Twin

Beech), 2 Cessna 196's, and a Cessna 182. All of these aircrait,

loaded and flying formation, could deposit 96 jumpers into

the air over Z-hills. I personally wouldn't want to be any.

where near such a mess but you get the idea - there are a lot

of jump platforms at the place.

For the 10-man event a DC-3 was used. It accommodated

three 10-man teams at a time plus assorted photographers.

observers, hangers-on, et al. Let's lay to rest right here the

fallacy that you can't use a DC-3 or a C-47 for RW. It's simply

not true. All it takes is know how and a nice hand at the

controls. Both the pilot, Bill Griffin, and the co-pilot, Bob

Porter, who owned the plane, have several hundred hours

each flying jumpers in this type aircraft.

Except for the first round, which the judges didn't see

because of intermittent clouds, we were climbing at 1,000 fpm

with 35 passengers in the plane and reaching 13,500 feet in

18 to 20 minutes, using 142 gallons an hour. At $7.00 a head

it beats flying freight. The exits averaged seven seconds per

team and our speed on jump run was 75-80 knots. During the

third round they had it down to 70 knots indicated. You say

that's not possible? It is and here's how: on jump run the

wheels are lowered, quarter flaps are extended

power is reduced on the left engine. The aircraft has a tendency

to yaw in this attitude but any experienced pilot can compen-

sate. Very little altitude is lost and at 13,500 who cares?

It was a good plane to jump from. You can stand up, stretch,

chant exhortational mantras, harass the other teams, in short,

really get yourself psyched up for some inspired wrist-breaking

The FAA On Seatbelts

It is certainly recognized that a

person experiencing an inadvertent

parachute opening white secured by

a safety belt would suffer serious

or possibly fatal injury. On the

other hand, we have evidence to

show

that accidents have been

caused by jump occupants who

were not wearing their safety belts.

The

Southern

Region

recently

investigated

two such accidents.

The pilot in each case was unable

to maintain control of the jump

aircraft because the parachutists on

board were not wearing their safety

should

nothing more than two minor in-

cidents resulted in serious accidents

through

noncompliance

Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)

91.14.

It is our feeling that safety

would suffer far more by allowing

parachutists to ignore this rule than

would be the case of requiring them

to have their safety belts fastened

during takeoff and landing. The

chances of a pilot having to

abort

a takeoff run or make an emergency

stop during landing will, I think,

be greater than inadvertent para-

chute openings during takeoff and

landing.

FAR 91.14 applies only during

takeoff and landing. The rule does

not

probibit unfastening safety

belts after a takeoff has been com-

pleted; however, I would sincerely

hope

that jump aircraft pilots

would request that satety belts be

kept fastened until an altitude has

been attained. which would at least

give the victim of an inadvertent

parachute opening a fighting chanc

or survival.

Your interest in aviation safety

is greatly appreciated and we wil

urther explore this problem with

the

United States

Parachute

Association and others that we have

contact with. It is hoped that you

will continue to assist us in our

efforts to keep the Federal Aviation

Regulations realistic and effective.

DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR'S NOTE

UNSUB,

aka DAN COOPER;

NORJAK;

CAA - HIJACKING;

00: SEATTLE;

SE 1644-81 PENDING) 9477

Background:

On 11/24/1971, Dan Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight, from Portland,

Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, by claiming he had a bomb. Cooper demanded four parachutes

and $200,000. The hijacker eventually jumped from the back of the plane with a parachute and

the ransom money, somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nevada. Although it is likely the

hijacker did not survive the jump, if living, the hijacker would likely be in his mid to late 70's.

The FBI Investigation, dubbed "NORJAK", for Northwest hijacking, has totaled over 1000

interviews, tracked leads involving all FBI Field Offices, and considered more than 800 suspects.

In 1980, a young boy found approximately $5,800 in decaying $20 bills, that matched the ransom

money serial numbers.

Recent Events:

Various agents have been assigned over the years to manage the leads that continue to

come in regarding the investigation and to manage the DNA Project. In 2004, a re-submission of

evidence resulted in the recovery of male nuclear DNA and was entered into CODIS for future

identification and elimination of suspects. The DNA Project identified possible candidates for

DNA comparison and individuals from which a DNA sample should be obtained. In 2006, the

Laboratory Division determined the degraded DNA sample could only be used to exclude

individuals as possible donors. To date, only a few of the original suspect pool have been

included in the DNA Project for comparison with negatives.

In recognition of the 35th anniversary of the hijacking (November 2008), the Seattle

Division granted limited media access to various portions of the case files. Numerous e-mails

were received in response, but nothing substantive until early March, when the Seattle Division

was contacted byL

Lof Amboy, WA.

children recovered a parachute from

an area on his property where|

was grading the property with a tractor. Apparently

unearthed the parachute without his knowledge and his children discovered it while

playing in the area. The children recovered the parachute by cutting the chute from the canopy

lines, which were deeply embedded in the ground

attempted to recover the remaining

portions of the parachute but his children were unable to locate the original area where the

parachute was discovered. Based on comparative analysis of the location of the parachute with

Cooper's probable jump zone, the discovery is plausible. The parachute is currently being

analyzed and reviewed by subject matter experts to determine if the parachute is consistent with

the age and type known to have been used by Cooper. This will determine if further

investigation is warranted. If the preliminary investigation confirms the parachute is related, a

determination will be made for further investigation at the recovery site.

Russ Gunby

Russ Gunby joined the US Army in 1940 and made his

first jump in 1944 after trying for 3 years to get accepted

into jump school. At the time, US Army regulations

forbade soldiers from jumping outside of military

operations jumps. Gunby disliked this rule and worked to

get it changed. He did unofficial jumps, breaking the ruies,

by using surplus equipment and hiring a pilot for $50. He

also founded the parachute club at Ft Ord, CA.

Gunby wrote Army Regulation 9519 in 1956. This

regulation actively encouraged sport parachuting. He went

around to many Army bases encouraging the

establishment of clubs. Much to his dismay, he received a

very cool reception to these ideas.

Gunby would ask a base Colonel to join the local club.

The Colonel would ask, "Why?" Gunby would say "Why

not, you've been jumping for years?" The Colonel would

then reply, "How much will you pay me?".

Gunby said, "I was dumbfounded. For the first time in my

life I found out there were Army paratroopers who didn't

like to jump. That really shocked me. I was going around

with my new regulations saying,

, "Hey look here, we can

all jump." and everybody was saying, "You're nuts, man".

After AR 9519 was official, surplus equipment was made

available. The big problem that surface was that anyone

could claim to be a parachuting instructor. This lead to

injuries and fatalities because of inadequate training

procedures.

This situation prompted Gunby to hitchhike to the PCA

Board meeting in NY in 1959. He asked about proposec

safety regulations. He was voted Secretary/Treasurer bj

the end of that meeting.

Russ Gunby, C-350, was the first skydiving instructor in

the US and conducted the first Instructor's course in 1959

in Phoenix, AZ. He also established the Area Safety

Officer (now S&TA) and the Conference (now Region)

method of representation.

Russ Gunby wrote a book called "Sport Parachuting - a

basic handbook of sport parachuting" in 1960 when at age

38 while still in the Army. He mortgaged his home to

produce the first printing. Later printings were

underwritten by Jeppesen.

More than 80,000 copies were sold. Gunby says of "Sport

Parachuting"... "In the beginning the book filled the void

in the absence of knowledgable instructors. Today it's used

to augment and reinforce student instruction, and that's

good. it has done much more than I originally anticipated."

His book was a cornerstone in writing down

methodologies and procedures for the safe training of

jumpers.

Gunby's Army career included enlisting as a private,

infantry combat leader, combat intelligence officer. He

attained the rank of Major in 20 years of service. Gunby

resigned from the Army in Dec. 1960 to become full time

Executive Director of PCA. He had a salary of about

$2000 per year.

PCA was headquartered in Mit. Kisco, NY and Gunby

lived in Monterey, CA. He stipulated that PCA had to be

run from Monterey in order for him to accept the position

of Executive Director.

PCA headquarters was relocated to Monterey, CA in 1960.

PCA membership was 859. Gunby served as Executive

Director from 1958 (?? sources conflict) to 1963.

In 1964, Gunby ran for PCA President and relinquished

the Executive Director position. Also in 1964, Parachute

Club of America (PCA) was changed to United States

Parachute Association (USPA) because the word club did

not properly express the stature of the organization.

Membership was over 10,000.

USPA presented Gunby with its Achievement Award in

1977. The inscription reads: "A founding spirit who saw

the future when others doubted. As author, Executive

Director and PCA President, he gave countless hours to

build the early framework of our sport."

Gumby was awarded PEIA's (former name of PIA) first

Achievement Award in 1981. Don Beck, PEIA Secretary

said, "When the Parachute Equipment Industry

Association first decided to create an Achievement Award,

the principle criterion was a major contribution to the sport

arachute field, but most importantly, it had to withstand

he test of time. Without question Russ Gunby's

contributions meet that criterion. His book, Sport

Parachuting, has been used as THE training manual for a

whole generation of skydivers and those training methods

are still being used. PEIA is proud to present this award to

an outstanding man in the filed of parachuting safety."

Gunby battled lung cancer and actually wanted to make a

one-lung jump in 1982. Gunby spent the last years of his

life in Tahlequah, OK. He died April 8, 1982 from lung

cancer.

Russell spent the next two days looking for the

Public records checks reveal that Russell authored the

parachuting is well documented online.

Russell's most prominent mention is in

Parachutehistory.com.

An article identifies him as the recipient

Sirs,

Knew frow the start that I wouldn't be caught.

I diän't rob Northwest Orient because I thought 1t

would be romantic, heroic or any rf the other euphemisms

that seem to attach thenselves to situations of high

I1sk.

I'm no modern day Robin Hood. Unfortunately do have

only 14 nonths to live.

My life has been one of hate, turmoll, hunger and sore

hate, this seemed to be the

fastest and most profitable

way to gain a few fast grains of peace of mind.

I don't blame people for hating me for what live done

nor do I blame anybody for wenting me to be caught and

punished, though this can never happen.

Here are some (not all) of the things working against

the authorities:

I'm not a boasting man

I left no fingerprints

worE & toupee

I wore putty make-up

They could add or subtract from the composite a hundred

times and not come up wiüh an accurate description; and

we both know it.

I've come and gone on several, airline flights already

and an not holed up in some obsure backwoods town.

Neither an 1 a psycho-pathia killer. As & matter of

fact I've never even rebeived a speeding ticket.

Thaik you for your attention.

Airborne is an outfit that can show you who you are.

Somebody who counts. One of a special breed of men.

You know who you are.

Join this special breed. Get a special knowledge of

yourself. Go Airborne. You'll get the best training there is.

no roof. There's never been more opportunity. For education.

For advancement. To see some of the world. To know some

of the people in it. To get to know what you really can do

fare rights and sea gull control, dental

hygiene and sex information, and

bankrolling troupes of actors, danc-

ers, marionettes and tumblers.

To some nervous citizens, "Oppor-

tunities for Youth," linchpin of the

summer youth program, seems a

scheme to subsidize radicals or slip

hush money to the vocally abrasive

young. But a good many students are

happily working for the first time with-

in a system they doubted had elbow.

room for the likes of them.

The idea was to get kids-high

school, college and graduate students

-off the streets and out of every-

body's hair without them slopping

over into the job market. Canada's un-

employment figures have been sprint-

ing a shade ahead of ours, and even

when the economy is blooming, there

are never enough summer jobs in

Canada, any more than there are in

the U.S. Neither country has much

need for young hands these days, so

more youngsters stay on in school

longer. Many need summer pay to

pick up part of their educational tab

But there are fewer tables to wait on,

bells to hop or lives to save for the

seasonal amateur.

Both the Canadian Government and

ours take on student summer help.

But young sunshine bureaucrats pick

up only part of the slack. The emphasis

on our side of the border is now busy-

work for the poor and potentially

troublesome. Most jobs are with the

Neighborhood Youth Corps, a pov-

erty program that gives work experi-

ence to youngsters from families be-

low the poverty line.

Canada hasn't followed our lead.

Canadians haven't had our summer

troubles and don't like means-tested

benefits (where you've got to prove

you're poor). Their new summer plan

is pegged to what Ottawa officials

call "changing life styles of kids." It

includes travel, language training (to

encourage bilingualism) and Oppor-

tunities for Youth, work young people

plan and run themselves. Government

types agree that "the kids want to do

a lot of things that have to be done

out in society and aren't going to be
