was the fifth anniversary, it was expected that an exceedingly

large number of press inquiries would be forthcoming.

impression that the statute of limitations would run in this

matter on 11/24/76.

In anticipation of these inquiries,

contact was made with the Internal Revenue Service at

Portland, Oregon, on 11/8/76, at which time

advised that the IRS had calculated the tas liability

which

would be payable on the $200,000 ranson paid at the time of

incident Involving the hijacking of a Northwest Airines

airliner by an unidentified individual known as "Dan Cooper""

The detalled questions you ask concerning this

investigation are logical ones.

However, anyone knowing

the answers to those questions would elther have had to be

very close to the investigation or be involved in the

violation itself. the processing of suspects developed

in a complex investigacion is much more difficult 1f all

the minute decalls of the violation are made known to the

general public.

The Courts have also established guidelines

for the commenting on pending prosecutive cases by accorneys,

investigators, and others in a position to have facts about

the cases.

Since this macter is currently an active pending

investigation, and since the responsible individual has now

been indicted, by a United States Grand Jury at Portland

Portland, Oregon

Dear

Enclosed find an article from the Sunday Oregonian dated November 1, 1976.

I meant to write to you soon after I read the article. Somehow I kept

putting it off. Now almost six years ago and no leads to the hijacker,

D.B. Cooper.

First of all, I am not seeking any phony fame.

I am wondering if it!&

possible: what I am about to write could be of any value to you. Reading

the article over several times makes me wonder if D.B. Cooper really did

jump from that plane. Furthormore, the two Air Defense Command F106 jet

interceptors which followed the 727 saw nothing. Or he could of jumped

some other place if he did jump other than near the Lewis River.

door could of been left open on purpose to mislead, or Cooper could have

left it that way and also threw out the no good parachutes to give a

person the idea he did jump. Or maybe one can give D.B. Cooper an "E"

for effort- he may not be so dumb as one may think. If he didn't use

the good parachutes, maybe after seeing they were no good, he decided

the others were also no good. So perhaps he then did the next best thing

and decided not to jump not knowing what the other parachutes were like.

He still could have jumped elsewhere, or he then could have mado a deal

with the pilot officers on the plano. Also, he could have hiddon in the

plane until they got to Reno and kept the money with him.

DATE: 4/27/78

At approximately 12:31 p.m., PST, 4/27/78, a

telephone call was received in the Portland Division from

MIKE WALLACE, CBS, New York.

By way of background, WALLACE called for SA

on 4/25/78, at 10:37 a.m. and again on the

morning of 4/26/78.

At 8:30 a.m., 4/27/78, with SA

in my

office, I placed a telephone call to MIKE

• WALLACE through

the New York Office, NY telephone 975÷2997. Upon talking to

Mr. WALLACE's assistant, I was informed that WALLACE was

unavailable, and he would return my call within two hours.

I asked that WALLACe call me direct, Identifying myselt by

name and title.

When WALLACE called at approximately

12:31 P.M., he asked for L

was at

that time busy on another telephone call and the switchboard,

having had been previously alerted to the call from WALLACE'S

office, routed the call to me.

When I was connected with

WALLACE, he advised initially that he had determined that the

was a complete hoax, that he had quite a bit

of television footage shot on this story, and they had quite a

bit of information but wanted to talk to the fBl to get answers

to several other questions. I asked him specifically if it

suggesting to the contrary; however, he did not definitely

disavow that this was his intentions.

that I had been apprised of his detailed conversation with

TOM COLL at Headquarters, and I had personally talked to Mr.

CoLli of his impending interest in the Portland Office, and

since it all had been discussed with COLL, no further

contact

would be made by the Portland Division.

He then asked if it

were therefore impossible for him to talk on the telephone

and I advised him that was the case.

then became belligerent making remarks such as, "This sounds

like the old Bureau, not the new Bureau, that we were in a

police state," etc.

I told WALLACE that he knew better than

that and that the Bureau had cooperated, but if he felt that

further discussion was necessary on this matter, he should

direct his inquiries to IOM COLL in Washington.

At his

*. Cot's extension at Bureau Headquarters.

I gave him the telephone number 324-3691 which was

A few minutes after termination of this call I tried

to telephone Mr. COLL only to discover that he was at that

moment on the telephone with MIKE WALLACE. The party answering

the

telephone in Mr. COLL's office said he did overhear COLI

saying on

CoLL, the person said that he was in a listening mode at that

time and it might be some time before he would be free to

talk to me.

COLL will return my call as soon as he completes

his conversation with

MIKE WALLACE.

TOM COLL returned my call advising that he had

finished having an extensive conversation with WALLACE

in which they regurgitated the conversation that they had

previously, with WALLACE also advising him that he was

satisfied that the original story was a hoax.

Bureau has decided as a consequence of a series

of telephone calls and previous interviews! granted to

members of the media by

(with Bureau concurrence)

that MIKE WALLACE or one of his staff will be permitted to

interview

as background only. The interview will

not be conducted over the telephone and will not be conducted

on camera.

Cort said that the information furnished by

would be background in nature concerning the

investigation and

was to be used by WALLACE only as background

and wah retribution.

I told him we had only minor reservations

with respect to this in that the office of origin has not

kept us informed of the full extent of the investigation,

particularly with respect to the outcome of numerous suspects.

CoLL said that would be no particular problem, that should

get to a position where he does not have the

information being sought, that he could merely state that in all

likelihood the information would be known to

the Seattle Office,

who was coordinating the whole investigation. I pointed out

that this reservation was accompanied by the overall reservations

we had considering the treatment afforded to the FBI by

"60 Minutes" on an earlier matter.

In this regard, I desired

a copy of the recording of the interview so that we would be

in a position

to dispel. any slanted or perverse reporting.

COLL responded by saying that the interview by WALLACE or his

associate was not to be recorded by WALLACE or his associate

except in note-taking form. He concluded by saying that he

would telephone WALLACE and inform him that the interview was

approved; however, that all arrangements must be made through

the SAC of the Portland Division personally.

Referenced airtel instructs that any additional

press inguiries concerning this 6 1/2 year old investigation

be referred to the Seattle Division for handling and sets

forth the text of what Seattle considers the only information

that should be released to the press.

Portland concurs in the theory that all media

NORJAK falls within this area and Seattle, as office of

origin, should indeed respond to all media inquiries to the

extent deened appropriate by Seattle and the Eureau.

Portland reels, however, that Its media credibility

will not be enhanced with this posture in this case at thi:

point in time.

As the Eureau and Seattle are aware, Portland,

, has been responding since NORJAK began

a 30-minute TV documentary. Further, Portland case Agent,

For the Portland Division at this point in time to

take a non-cooperative posture with the media can only diminish

the credibility of this Division's media relations,

not to

mention the overall Bureau credibility with the media.

am confident that the information released prior to my arrival

in the Portland Division and am equally certain that the

information released subsequent to my arrival in the Portland

Division has in no way invaded the privacy of witnesses or

otherwise had any adverse affect on the prosecutive potential

of this case. Io the contrary, it has been the notoriety

generated by Portland's cooperation with the media that has

maintained a steady flow of information coming from the general

public. It can be readily understood that the failure to solve

this case is not the type of publicity which any individual

office of the Bureau as

a whole would be soliciting. With the

lack of positive investigative leads, the cooperation of the

public is for all practical purposes the only source of informa-

tion which may lead to the solution of the case. The text of

the release suggested by Seattle certainly does not give the

public (our source of leads in this matter) a full profile of

'D. B. COOPER."

It is Portland's recommendation that the Bureau adopt

the general policy of one Bureau spokesman in any investigation

which has national or regional interest and that the information

to be released be coordinated by the SAC of that office and the

Public Affairs Office at FBIHQ, and that this practice anc

investigation t

preclude the very reasons that are articulated by Seattle in

retel. Obviously, it then becomes the responsibility of the

spokesman office to meet the entire media responsibilities

for the Bureau as a whole for the life of the investigation.

The three male members of the crew remained in the cabin.

When the plane was loaded at Portland, there were

37 passengers plus

the 6 members of the crew.

When the

passengers deplaned at Seattle, only 36 got off with

the subject remaining on board.

All the passengers were interviewed but only four

saw the subject and were able to give some assistance with

descriptive data. The plane departed SEA-TAC at 7:36PM, after

being fully gassed. At the instructions of the UNsUB, the

flaps were left down at 15 degrees and he also instructed

the landing gear remain down and at first wanted the steps

to remain down, but it was explained to him that it was

mechanically impossible to take off with the steps down.

He thereupon agreed that they could be raised for take off

but lowered once they were airborne.

The UNSUB mentioned going to Mexico City, but

because they would have to refuel, due to the extra drag caused

by the flaps down, etc., he agreed to a flight down to

Sacramento, and then over to Reno. Shortly after take off

from Seattle-Tacoma Airport, the UNSUB had the stewardess

show him how to operate the stairs and then told her to go

into the First Class Section, which she did, and to close

the curtain behind her. She then went into the cabin

with the rest of the crew and locked the door after her.

A few minutes later they had intercom contact with the subject

but the last contact with him was at approximately 8:05 PM.

Within the

next 10 minutes, the crew experienced

oscillation in the plane and speculated that it was caused

by the subject departing the plane by way of the rear door.

The crew of the above airline has now spotted a

possible area for this suspected departure of the

hijacker to be over Merwin Lake, near Woodland, Washington.

A search is now being conducted by helicopter

and ground crews working out of the Woodland Police Department.

NORTHWEST FLIGHT 305,

11/24/71

CAA - HIJACKING; EXTORTION

At 8:15 AM on 11/26/71 I called SA HENRY SHUTZ

at the Bureau.

I advised him we were directing our search generally

in the vicinity of an area approximately 15 miles north of

Woodland, Washington, this being the northernmost point of

the flight where the

Unsub was known to have been in the air-

plane.

I told him that we were using Sheriff's officers from

Cowlitz and Clark Counties, as well as our own agents.

The Army was sending 2 helicopters, we were getting

2 helicopters from the Weyerhaeuser Co. and then we were using

1 helicopter from the International Guard in Portland.

In response to his questions, set forth in SA CHIPMAN's

memorandum of 11/26/71, I told him that we would be using the

military helicopters approximately I hours and that we would

not have agents aboard.

He said that the Pentagon had called and wanted to

charge us $250 an hour per unit, and the cost is too high,

estimating it would run approximately $2,000 a day.

I told

him I thought we could hire private ones cheaper than that.

While talking to SHUTz, I talked to SA MANNING, who

advised

that Bonneville Power Administration had 5 helicopters

at Bonneville and that possibly we could get them.

I advised

SA SHUTZ that we would take steps at once to do this.

He told me that the Bureau was sending the artist

to Minneapolis where the entire crew is located so that they

could be interviewed to finalize the artist's conception.

advised him I thought we had sent in the revision but in

talking to ASAC BIBLER learned we hadn't but would do so

immediately.

SA SHUTZ wanted to know generally what area we

were planning on searching. I told him we would search the

area which is approximately 20 miles square, approximately

miles north of Woodland, Washington. I advised him that

we were doing this today and then we would continue the search on

the air flight pattern approximateln to Eugene, Oregon, which

is approximately 100 miles, this being largely

a valley, but

beyond that there was some question in my mind as to the wisdom

of the search since it was entirely over mountains, most of which is

probably covered with snow now and at 10,000 feet, the parachute

could drift in many directions. Further,

with a

white parachuts

it would be extremely difficult to locate in snow-covered mountains.

I advised him I would fbrry about that part when I

finished what seemed to be more urgent.

The stewardess on the plane when interviewed

As a result she saw him wrap this

SAC CAMPBELL speculates that the money was wrapped in the

He advised that the second parachute in the plane

is a backpack, which has never been opened. It is pink and

it is being taken to the National Guard in Reno at once to

see if it is in workable condition.

with a microfilm canister containing photographs of the

serial numbers of $250,000 worth of notes, in various

denominations.

advised that the Bureau should

only be concerned

with the serial numbers of the $20 bills.

The extortion package which was given to the hijacker contained

only bills of $20 denomination.

said the microfilm

contained the serial numbers of $230,000 of $20 bills. He

provided a list of serial numbers of the $20 bills which were

on the microfilm, itself, but were not included in the

extortion money package which the Unsub received.

These

$20 bills are packed in packets of 100 bills; and

provided the first and last serial numbers in each of these

packets

of 100 bills. He advised that these serial numbers

At 8:20 PM on November 24, 1971, I talked to

SA DON HANNING

at the Bureau.

I told him there was a

substantial number of the members of the press in the

immediate vicinity of the airport and they were extremely

anxious to have a statement from the Bureau.

I advised

him that I proposed that I go to them and outline the

essential facts of the case so far as sequence of events

are concerned and the present status. In this, after

checking with Northwest Airlines officials I would advise

them that $200,000 had

been paid to the kidnapper by

Northwest Airlines, that four parachutes had been furnished

to him, and that the plane was then aloft enroute to either

Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California or Medford, Oregon.

He advised this would be satisfactory.

in Portland were on their way to Woodland now; that those

three, together with the one supplied by Weyerhaueser

seemed to me to be enough and in view of this he should

advise Army pilots that they were being nelieved.

furnished this information to SA

at the Bureau and told

him that since we would very likely have to pay for them

anyway pending the decision as to whether we would continue

their use, we utilize them but were in the process of

relieving them at once.

I furnished him the details of

the replacement helicopters.

advised him that since we had found other helicopters

we were relieving his men and thanked them very much.

Jof U. S. Parachute Association, Montereyi, California,

advised as follows:

The U. S. Parachute Association maintains a membership

list for the entire country.

All parachutists are not, in

fact, members of USPA; however, the overwhelming majority of

them are members.

In addition to membership lists, the USPA carries

a list of parachute instructors and if UNSUB had taken para-

chute lessons within the past year, it might be possible to

identify him through the list of instructors. maintained by

USPA.

It should be emphasized that instructors would

probably remember most parachutists above the age of 40

since the majority of new students are younger.

air today and were searching the same general area where we

had searched yesterday.

I told him that we wanted to get

the artist's conception here as soon as possible.

He

suggested that we contact the Minneapolis Office since the

artist may have left a copy of the picture there.

Inquiry

of Minneapolis revealed that telecopier was not working and

по copy

was retained. I called SAL

back, told him

that we

wanted to have the normal number of copies of the

artist's conception

as would be necessary for the law enforce-

ment mailing list plus 1,000, and the same number should go

to portland for immediate distribution. I asked him to

arrange for this work to be done today and the material sent

out by pilot courier at the first opportunity.

At 8:15 a.m. on November 27, 1971, I received a

call from SA

at the Bureau.

He advised that

the UPI Wire Service in Washington carried a story with a

Woodland, Washington dateline quoting SA MANNING as saying

"We are going to interview every sky jumper in Southwest

Washington" and "We look at what happened a man jumps from

a plane in the middle of a dark stormy night, he is either

an experienced jumper

he is crazy:

We've got to check

both angles"

advised that since the Director had

said we were to make no additional comments on the matter

why MANNING had made this statement.

I told him that I don't

think that MANNING made it and I would check and let him

know.

At 11:15 I called

back and told him that

those remarks

were common remarks among many many people in

the search area but that MANNING had made no such remark to

any newspaper person and that MANNING had been told not to

make any.

On November 26, 1971,

at 2:15 p.m., I talked to

SAC MATSON regarding the air search of the area from portlanc

Oregon, and pointed out to him that we were through

with the

air search in the area in Washington, and I had

suggested to SA MANNING that he have the Bonneville Power

Administration and the Weyerhauser Helicopter Pilots contacted

to see if they would be willing to assist in the air search in

Oregon.

If so, then I told him to contact SAC MATSON.

MATSON advised that the weather south of portland now is

closing

in very rapidly and it did not appear feasible to con-

opportunity.
