Facts of complaint C. stated subject

who generally matches the descrip-

tion of the Unsub in Norjak, however has greying hair, had come

in to his bank on November 11, 1971 to open an account. He

represented himself as al

who obtained a large sum of money.

He wanted infor-

mation about how money was marked, how it could be traced, how

large an amount was necessary before Internal Revenue was

advised,

C. gave him very evasive answers, and originally suspected

subject might be considering a bank robbery. Subject opened his

account with an unemployment check from the state of Illinois,

and has made no sizeable deposits since that time.

However,

when C. asked for his prior bank, he furnished the West Des

Moines

: State Bank, Des Moines, Iowa. C. is still awaiting

verification of subject's signature from that bank, but noted

it seemed strange he banked in Iowa but had an unemployment

check from Illinois. Subject did not open a safety deposit box.

C. further stated

subject has been in about five times since he

opened his account, and a week or two ago asked the taller what

his balance was.

It was only $9.00, so he left and returned

then deposited four $20 bills in his account.

The teller did

not check the bills, but C. has instructed her to check any

further bills he deposits.

Thanksgiving or Thanksgiving Day, however, has almost daily

contact with him. She has been unaware of his being out of the

area at all and recalled talking to him on the telephone at his

apartment on the day before Thanksgiving.

on the same date, I

telephonically contacted

the Los Angeles Office and offered to cooperate fully. He

stated he recalls having eaten dinner on Thanksgiving eve at

Pio's Restaurant on Pier Avenue in Hermosa Beach. He statec

he eats there daily and is well known to the cook and

He advised he was not working on that day and would have been

at his apartment or at Pio's.

On January 13, 1972,

Pio's Restaurant, 19 Pier Avenue, Hermosa

Beach, California,

was contacted and advised that

is well known to

her and most of the employees in the restaurant. She stated

frequents the restaurant daily to the point of being a

nuisance, sipping on coffee for sometmes as long as three hours

a day.

She recalls the restaurant was open on November 24, 1971,

but closed on Thanksgiving Day and is certainl

was at the

restaurant on November 24, 1971.

She statedeshe would have

recalled his not being there as

someone always calls and asks

if he is or has been there.

She has never known him to smoke

a cigarette, but always a pipe and advised although known to

be a parachutist, she cannot recall a day when he has not

appeared at the restaurant except when it is closed.

He is seldom employed, but when he does claim to work

man who uses the restaurant as a place to meet people, uses

their telephone to receive calls and gets some mail there.

He continues to be hard up financially.
