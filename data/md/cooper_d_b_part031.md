ReBuairtel 1/2/73 to Seattle, Denver, and Minneapolis.

The color sketch prepared of Unsub in captioned case,

which is marked "B* and dated 1/2/73, is considered by Exhibits

Section at this date to be the best likeness obtainable from descriptive

data available. The original artist's sketch, with and without sunglasses

and designated as "A" sketch, was a black and white rendering of Unsub

prepared immediately following hijacking. Subsequently the color sketch,

with and without sunglasses, was developed and marked as "B" sketch.

Although a divergence of opinion regarding certain characteristics has

appeared in descriptions given by the various witnesses, the consensus

indicates that a good likeness of Unsub is shown by the artist's sketch

and that the "g" sketch with the added dimension of color more accurately

shows the Unsub's age and overall likeness.

In view of the numerous contacts with the witnesses who

supplied the descriptive data from which the sketch was prepared and

the lapse of time since they observed the hijacker, it is felt no construc-

tive purpose can be served by further attempts at modification based on

contact with these same witnesses.

On June 1, 1973, BILL CLAUSNER, Sheriff of

to be nearer her family.

The elderly lady is named Mrs.

MIDLAND, according to CLAUSNER.

Subsequent to her move, an envelope was dis-

covered in the vacant home containing the $20 bills.

CLAUSNER advised all of

run through NCIC, as well as compared with serial numbers

on the D. B. COOPER ransom list.

There was no match
