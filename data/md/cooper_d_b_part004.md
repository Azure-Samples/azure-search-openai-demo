Cooper Still

At Large

These are official FBi sketches of a man who gave his

name* as Dan Cooper and hijacked a Northwest Airlines jet en

route from Portland to Seattle last Thanksgiving Eve. The

hijacker parachuted from the plane with $200,000 in ransom

money and signaled the era of the parachuting hijacker. He

is still at large and authorities say they have no firm clues to

his whereabouts.

bomb which would blor up the plane

unless his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000

and four parachutes in exchange for

the safely uf the 36 passengers

aboard the plane. When the aircraft

landed at Seattle, Northwest Orient

Airlines complied with his instruc-

Stious. After he receive I the parachutes

and money, the hijacker allowed all

Passengers

and two of the airline

stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew

members into the first-class section of

the aircraft and informed them he

desired to fly to Mexico City. The hi-

jacker instructed that the plane pro-

ceed in a southerly direction and fly at

a low altitude and slow speed which en-

abled the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

COOPER: All righr...

ANON: Was your briefcase bomb real, or was it fake?

COOPER: It was real, in the sense that it worked. In

actuality, it was a fake. The dynamite sticks the

stewardesses blabbered about were nothing more than

some Gillette shaving-cream cans rigged with

prima-cord

fuses. Five of them were in the briefcase I flashed. I

painted them red because people always associate that

color with something explosive, like dynamite.
