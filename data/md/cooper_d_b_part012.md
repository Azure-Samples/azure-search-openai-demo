This Man Jumps From

Airplanes for 'Kicks'

Here we have a man who jumps out of airplanes for fun.

He falls at 120 miles an hour. He glides like a bird. He

blossoms out with a parachute. He lands with a bump.

He's always a little fearful before each jump, but he thinks

that's OK. His name is Sheri-

dan Peterson, former Montana

smoke jumper, now a Boeing

• TESTS REQUIRED

When one wants to be a sky-

diver, one has to go through super-

vised testing period. First there's

short delays — then

the delays

(from airplane to release of para-

chute) get longer. Then there are

licensing phases. And, all club

jumps are supervised by a safety

officer. Then-if the main para-

chute fails, skydivers always have

an

auxiliary one. Consequently

skydiving is quite safe, maintains

Sheridan Peterson.

There's only one minor draw-

eye on your wife.

"Wives," says

Peterson, "are considered by many

to be the greatest obstacle to sky-

idiving. There seems to be one way

out of this problem - get more

women interested in the sport."

Paul M. Clifford, Boeing Employee Skydivers'

president, placed third in the style event at the

second annual Central Washington Skydiving tour-

nament at Sunnyside last Saturday and Sunday.

Clifford, a professional exhibitionist with more

than 270 delay-falls, made a figure eight and a back

roll in less than 15 seconds from 4,000 feet. Rainy

weather imposed the low-altitude regulation on the

stunt jumpers who ordinarily fall from 7,200 feet.

Six other Boeing employees participated in the

contest. David Lithgow, Ralph Mulvihill and Clif-

ford

competed, in the senior spot jumping, team

jumping, and style jumps. Those competing in the

junior

event were Jack Simmons, Jim O'Brien,

Sheridan Peterson and Peter Thomas.

that there

was an extortion in progress at Sea-Tac Airport.

then drove his unmarked police vehicle to the Seattle First

National Bank where he met various bank officials who had

in their possession $200,000. in currency. He drove them

to the airport, reaching the Northwest Airlines Operation

Also four parachutes were loaded into the police

car as were eight crew meals and one set of instructions

for exiting the Boeing 727.

then drove the vehicle out onto the runway.

His car was followed by a stairway truck and a gas truck.

He stopped the vehicle approximately 300 yards from the

plane landing area at approximately 5:45 PM. Shortly there-

after he observed the plane land and drove the car to the

ten to eleven o'clock angle of the nose of the plane. He

remained in the parked car and a short time later one

stewardess exited the plane via the stair truck and approached

his car. She obtained the sack containing the $200,000. and

took it on board the plane.

She made other trips from the

car to the plane carrying the parachutes and the exiting

instructions and the flight crew meals.

During this period of time, all of the passengers

left the plane and proceeded approximately 200 feet beyond

the police vehicle.

The passengers boarded a bus which met

them at that area and then the bus proceeded toward the

terminal.

SUBJECT: UNSUB;

NORTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT 305

PORTLAND TO SEATTLE, 11/24/71

CAA - HIJACKING; EXTORTION

On 11/29/71 I talked to

Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

I pointed out to him that I had examined the 1og of

this flight very carefully and it would appear that the area

in which we are currently searching is the most logical one to

search.

However, I was curious to know if the pilot would be

able to detect a

difference in the trim of the plane, caused

by the added weight brought about through the hijacker's

descent on the stairway

b7C

said this would very likely be

not for the fact that the plane

was on "automatic pilot" during the flight, which he des-

cribed as being a normal procedure.

He continued, however,

and said he had examined minutely the flight recorder record

was unable to detect any similar occurrence in the airplane

at the site we are presently searching. He advised that in view

of this very likely there would be no other logical place

to commence a search at this time.

Enclosed for each receiving office are two copies of an

artist's conception of captioned unsub.

Shortly after 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST)

11/24/71, a lone white male traveling from Portland, Oregon, to

Seattle, Washington, on captioned flight displayed the contents of

his brief case to a stewardess indicating to her it was a bomb

which would be exploded unless his demands were met. The hijacker

indicated his willingness to exchange the safety of the 36 passen-

gers and crew for $200,000 in cash and four parachutes. He

instructed that the plane circle the Seattle airport until his

demands were met at which time the plane landed. Once the money

and parachutes were loaded and the plane was being refueled, the

hijacker allowed the passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane leaving a flight crew of three males and one female and

the hijacker aboard. The hijacker indicated a desire to fly to

Mexico City and instructed the plane to take off flying at a low

altitude and slow speed, maintaining a southerly direction. Upon

demand the hijacker was

instructed on lowering

the rear passenger

door while the aircraft was in flight. He was last seen in the

aircraft by crew members at 8:05 p.M.

the hostage stewardess to go forward to the first class section and

close the curtains behind her.

Stewardess complied, going through

first class section into pilot's cockpit and locking door behind her.

Prior to departing from passenger cabin, hijacker told stewardess

the me ey bhe pag

the money bag was not in accordance with instructions and to cut

up one of the parachutes to rewrap the money, which was done. When

the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, for refueling, the hijacker,

two parachutes, the ransom money, and the vinyl brief case had

disappeared.

Investigation determined that the hijacker had purchased

his ticket at the Portland Airport shortly before the plane's departure.

Upon arrival at Seattle, all passengers were accounted for except a

white male using the name Dan Cooper. There were no sky marshals

aboard this flight and at no time did subject show any firearms.

From information available, the subject is described as

white male, mid 40's, 5'10" to.6', 170 to 180 pounds, average to well

built, olive or swarthy complexion, medium smooth, dark brown or

black hair parted on left side, combed back, sideburns to low ear

level, dark eyes, probably black or brown.

Subject wore a dark suit,

white shirt, with narrow black tie. He wore dark glasses with plastic

rims (possibly prescription lenses) most of the time. He had dark

overcoat and was described as cool and calculating. His voice was

lOW.

He spoke intelligently and was a heavy smoker of Raleigh filter

tip cigarettes.

All leads should be handled immediately and set out tele-

phonically and confirmed by teletype. The Bureau must be kept advised

of all pertinent developments as they occur. A list of the loot is

being prepared and will be disseminated. Consider subject dangerous.
