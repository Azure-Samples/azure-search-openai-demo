munication.

There are currently 637 suspects, 470 of whom have

cations, it is requested that all field offices originating

NORJAK communications, not only refer to the appropriate

communications but also include the suspects) name and

alias(es) if known on the first page under the title NORJAK.

for the information of all field offices, the

Bureau advised by airtel Septenber 15, 1972,

that this is

the only aircrait hijacking in which

the subject has not

been identified and apprehended nor the ransom money

in this important case are to be

set forth expeditiously.

The investigation of this case

is to be vigorously pursued in all faceis

in order to

bring

it to a successful completion.

It is noted that the investigative period overlaps

previous NORJAK reports.

This has been done since previous

reports were not distributed to all field offices.

It is noted that Unsub in this matter is almost

universally called "D. B. COOPER" by the press, the public,

and even by Bureau personnel. Factually, there

Police Department, visited him in The Dalles, and definitely

identified him as

and the

fact was noted that he could not have been on the plane since

he was at The Dalles.

There was no FBI release to the press concerning

It is suggested that the fact that the name "D.B.

outside the Bureau in order to utilize this fact as an aid

in the initial evaluation of new leads.

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

This list in no way represents all the means avail-

able to process a suspect. Each individual case prompts a

different method; one or more of the below listed methods

have been used in the past.

1. Obtain current descriptive data (particularly

useful is age, height and complexion),

2. Ascertain location on November 24, 1971, by

(a) checking employment records.

(b) checking cancelled checks or credit card

transactions.

(a) interviewing acquaintances or relatives

(note November 24th was the day before

Thanksgiving, 1971).

PROFILE

The purpose of the following information is to

conveniently list all the known facts concerning the hi-

jacker's

profile and to combine them with suppositions that

can be

reasonably inferred fron those facts.

The suppositions

have been Included to aid in processing a suspect.

They

should not be considered as concrete facts, nor should they

be used as the sole determining factor in drawing investi-

gative conclusions.

SUMMARY

Unsub was a well spoken, conservative gentleman;

probably a Catholic with Mexican

or Indian blood.

He was

not an alcoholic. He probably lived in the Portland or

Seattle areas or had flown more than once over these areas.

He apparently had no accomplices.

He was not an experienced

skydiver and most probably received his jump training in

the military. His hijacking plan was not well thought out,

and he was probably not an experienced criminal. He was

apparently having financial troubles prior to November, •

1971, and he_may have previously worked in an airline-

related indus

try.

The reasons for the above suppositions are in-

cluded below.

BACKGROUND

ransom money. Unsub reportedly became somewhat childish

in his actions and comments while counting the money.

pit'

Unsub was familiar with the Seattle area, as

indicated by his comments concerning the plane's location

as it flew over Tacoma, Washington.

In addition, Unsub

a comment as to the distance

• McChord Air Force Base

was in relation to Sea-Tac Airport.

Unsub reportedly

indicated McChord was approximately 20 minutes fron

Sea-Tac, which is essentially correct.

SE 164-81

Unsub stated he was hijacking the aircraft

because of a grudge. He mav have had a

relative, possibly

a son, killed in Vietnam or he may have had recent finan-

cial problems which would foster such a grudge.

Unsuh's complexion has been described as swarthy

or dark. The prudre may be associated with his background

which could possibly be Indian, Mexican or possibly

Italian descent.

Note unsub has been described by witness

as definitely having some Mexican or Indian

"blood" in him.

b7C

It is noted the northwest area at the time of the

hijacking was

suffering

from a

and

since Unsub was familiar with the Seattle area as

depressed economic conditions

dicated above, it is possible Unsub was out of work at the

time of NORJAK.

In addition, Unsub demonstrated considerable

knowledge of aircraft and of

and it is

felt he was

to assume unsub may possibly have been out of

work in an

airlines-related industry.

His actions and reactions that occurred throughout

the hijacking indicate unsub

probably was not a desperate

man, non was he mentally ill such as a paranoid type.

Unsub

exhibited an unusually calm manner throughout the whole: .?.

hijacking.

Unsub was probably a "loner" and carried out the

hijacking by himself, with no partners. Throughout the

hijacking, he exhibited a competency in reacting to various.

situations that arose.

Itis-believed that Unsub was not

an-experienced.criminal,-but a-victim-of-circumstances.

Unsub's physical build and his handiness with the

parachute shroud lines indicates coordination and some

physical ability as will as inventiveness.

(It is noted

that during the

hijacking unsub requested a knapsack to put

the money in and he received

a small white bar instead.

Unsub took a small pocket knife from his person and

fashioned a means to attach the small bag to his body using

parachute lines from an unused parachute. Since it is

SE 164-81

believed unsub was not well prepared for the hijacking and

had not thoroughly thought the hijacking out, he most pro-

bably always carries a small pocket knife with him.

The following information tends to indicate unsub

was somewhat conservative in his thinking and dress:

1. Short style hair

2. Age mid 40's

3.

Dark colored suit, dark colored raincoat,

white

shirt, narrow black tie.

Unsub did not swear and showed a great deal

of respect for the stewardesses on the

airline because they were women. (Unsub

engaged in a small argument with one of the

passengers, as well as experiencing extremely

tense and nervous

situations, and through it

all he never used profane language - this

might indicate he is possibly a religious

man.

Since lie did drink, and since he is

possibly religious, he probably is not a

Batist or Mormon.)

The following information tends to indicate Unsub

possibily possessed athletic ability:

His physical build was described as average

to well built, even though his age was

described as in his mid-40's.

2. Unsub exhibited some physical dexterity using

his hands and a small knife.

3. Unsub apparently parachuted from an aircräft

at night; something that would require no

small degree of physical ability.

It is felt unsub possibly maintains his physical

well being through regular exercise.

The following information tends to indicate the

Unsub was a gentleman:

1. He offered to tip the stewardesses on the

after he received his ransom

He did not offer them ransom money

as the tip, but used his own money.

2. During the entire hijacking he did not use

profane language.

3. Throughout the hijacking he maintained a calm

demeanor and spoke low and intelligently.

The following information tends to indicate

Unsub lived in the northwest area at some time in his life:

1. Unsub knew the distance from McChord to

Sea-Tac and recognized Tacoma, Washington from

the air.

2. Unsub was dressed in a suit and lightweight

overcoat which is commonly worn by manv north-

west area residents.

3. No accent or unusual speech mannerisms were

detected by the Northwest Airlines stewardesses

who had a chance to observe him.

SPORT PARACHUTIST

The hijacker is probably not a sports parachutist

nor is he a member of a sport parachute

club.

The reasons

for this are as follows:

The hijacker requested two back parachutes

and two front parachutes. He gave no specific

• the type of parachute that

he desi have reques a as parachutest to glacie.

-

COVER PAGE

DB Cooper-11384

## Page 17

-

SE 164-81

Several sport parachutists have advised that

The hijacker was furnished a parachute that

opens quickly, has a high rate of descent, and one that was

not steerable.

3. The hijacker was furnished two front parachutes,

commonly called chest packs which are to be used

in an emergency when the back pack parachute

or main parachute fails to open properly.

chest pack parachute the hijacker took with hit

was a dummy parachute.

It was designed for lectures to demon-

strate to new parachutists the proper method of opening a

chest pack parachute. It is felt an experienced sports

para-

chutist would probably have noticed this defect.

4. Unsub's age has been described as mid 40's

and it is noted that the average age in most

sport parachute clubs is mid 20's.

If Unsub

was a

member of a sport parachute club he would

certainly be an unusual member, one that would

be easily recognized by the other members, as well as one that

was well known because of his unusual age.

It is felt that due

to the large amount of publicity aforded this case, someone

in a sport

was a member of any sports parachute club.

When the stewardess presented the parachutes

to the hijacker she also presented an instruction sheet on

how to utilize a parachute.

At that time, Unsub stated he

did not need any instructions concerning

the use of a

parachute.

Since Unsub did not specify a specific type of

chute and because of the above reasoning concerning Unsub's

age, it is felt Unsub was not an experienced jumper or even

a sport jumper. In addition, Unsub probably had some jump

training, most probably obtained while in the military.

HABITS

Unsub drinks in moderation and is probably not an

alcoholic. Unsub ordered one bourbon and seven at the be

ginning of the flight and although he was offered several

free drinks later, he turned them down. This would indicate

that Unsub possessed sufficient willpower to refuse alcohol

in a tension-filled situation.

It is believed an alcoholic

or a former alcoholic who had just had one drink and was

placed in a sicuation of sinilar stress would succumb to the

pressure and imbibe in the free drinks offered him by the

stewardesses.

Located in the ashtray utilized by Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter cigarettes,

and

the eighth cigarette

is possibly the same.

These cigan-

ettes

are sold in a "soft pack". Unsub was in the aircraft

eight hours in an extrenely tense situation. During the

eight hours, he had eight cigarettes.

smoker would have consumed 20 cigarettes in eight hours

under normal circunstances. It is felt Unsub may possibly

smoke less than one pack a day.

CLOTHES

Located in Seat 18 E (the seat Unsub occupied)

was a black clip-on tie which contained a tie clip des-

cribed

as yellow gold in color, with a white pearl circular

stone in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name

tie. Investigation at Las Vegas indicated this type tie

was sold for about $1.50 and that this particular tie was

about a year to a eyear and a half old.

It was a favorite

item

: for individuals such as waiters, busboys and barten-

dens.

Stewardess

has said that this tie, found bic

on the aircraft, was probably Unsubs and other witnesses have

indicated he wore a similar type tie.

## Page 19

SE 164-81

Since Unsub wore a tie during the hijacking and

for other

reasons described above, it is felt he was possibly

an executive. However, since the tie was narrow and

clip-on type not currently in style, Unsub was possibly

not on a top-level executive.

Unsub carried with him a cheap briefcase thai

appecred to be new.

It is thought the hijacker probably

purchased this briefcase just prior to the hijacking to be

used during the hijacking only.

Unsub wore a white shirt with small collar points

indicating he probably did not have the money to obtain a

more fashionable wardrobe (i.e. more colorful shirts with

larger collars currently in style).

The white shirt could

also indicate the hijacker's conservative taste in clothing.

EDUCATION

Unsub was accessed to be a high school graduate

possibly with some college training, based primarily on

vocabulary used during the hijack.

Further, Unsub impressec

stewardesses as possibly being experienced in dealing with

people.

They, therefore, concluded he was the executive

type and seemed to naturally dictate the ransomed demands

to the stewardesses in lieu of writing the notes out himself.

CRIME AFOARD AIRCRAFT - FIJACKING; EXTORTION

Seattle, Washingtor

Synopsis:

' On November 24, 1971; a white male skyjacked a North-

west Airlines Flipht

from Portland to Seattle.

hijacker denanded and received $200,000 and four para-

chutes upon landing at Seiitle-Tacoma International

Airport.

After receiving the ransom money, the hilacker

allowed the passengers to leave. The plane then took

off for Roin and at 8:11 p.m. a pressure oscillation

was noted by the plane's crew.

That pressure oscillation

was probahly caused by the hijacker leaving the aircraft.

Search of the aircraft at Reno revealed the hilackir

was not in the plane when it landed. Extensive seirches

of

the area into which the hijacker would have landed

ralled to locate the hilacker on any evidence of value.

twenty dollar bill and had no luggage.

He occupied seat

number 18 E on the aircraft.

The Boeing 727 has three seats on each side of

the aisle.

Row 18

is the last one on both the right and

left side

of the aisle.

The seats are identified from left

to right as you face the front of the aircraft with A, B,C

on the left side of the aisle and D (aisle seat), E (center seat)

and F (window seat) on the right side.

Almost flush against the back of row 18, except

for some eight inches near the aisle, is a bulkhead which

forms the wall for the lavatories, located behind row 18;

one on the right and one on the left. Beyond the lavatory

doors is the door leading to the air stairs.

The door to the air stairs is always closed and

locked, except when loading or unloading passengers. It is;

located straight away at the end of the aisle beyond now 18

and is perhaps some

3⅔ feet from the last row and is in

easy reach for someone sitting in row 18.

Built into the lower portion of the door to the

air stairs is the stewardess seat which is pulled down when

in use, so that a person sitting in that seat looks straight

that a presen sirting

down the aisle toward the front of the aircraft. On take-off

this seat was occupied by Stewardess

Prior to the time the aircraft taxied on the pun

Seven Up from Stewardess

As the aircraft taxied toward the runway for

takeoff, Unsub turned and handed Stewardess L

envelope containing a note written in black felt-tip pen on

plain white unlined paper which said:

"Miss, I have a bomb here and I would like you to

sit by me".

The hijacker then dictated the following:

"I want $200,000 by

5:00 p.m. in cash". (No

specification as to denomination, age or sequence of bills).

"Put it in a Knapsack, I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes" (no other specification concerning para-

chute types).

"When we land

I want a

fuel truck ready

to refuel" (probably his flying experience caused him to

add this).

"No funny stuff or I'll do the job" (the first

attempted parachute skyjacking had been foiled about 12

days

earlier by the hijacked aircraft's crew.)

The hijacker showed both Stewardesses the contents

of his briefcase and stated it was an electrical device and

requested the aircraft radio be used as little as possible.

The hijacker explained why he hijacked this plane

by stating

"it's not because I have a grudge against the

airlines, it's because I have a grudge."

The hijacker then added that the flight suiter

his time, place and plans (probably the convenience of a

Portland to Seattle flight suited the hijacker).

The hijacker very carefully demanded that each and

every note either written by him or dictated to the stevardess

by him be returned to him and he also had a used match cover

which was used to convey notes returned to him.

Stewardess

showed Stewardess

the demand notes and then went to the cockpit where she

displayed them to the captain of the aircraft.

She thereafter

remained in the cockpit where she prepared thirteen pages of

notes concerning the hijacking.

The aircraft landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 PM, PST, at

which time $200,000. in twenty dollar bills, weighing 19 pounds,

two back chutes and two chest chutes were given to him in a

white canvas bag.

The passengers then were allowed to deplane

as were Stewardess

land another stewardess.

The hijacker went to the lavatory just behind row

18 (the row he which he was sitting)

and as he exited the

lavatory he was seen carrying the briefcase on its side in

ooth arms, with a 12"x16"x4" light-colored package on top

of the briefcase.

Stewardess

then acted as a communica-

tions media between the

Unsub and the captain of the air-

craft until about five minutes after the aircraft departed

the Seattle-Tacona International Airport when she was instruct-

ed to go to the cockpit by the Unsub.

The hijacker's instructions after receiving

the money were vague.

He probably wanted to jump from the

aircraft as soon as possible after the takeoff.

The hi-

jacker put two of the parachutes,

a back pack and a front

pack, on prior to take off.

He also wanted the air stairs

lowered prior to takeoff, which subsequently proved to be

impossible.

was delayed from jumping by the

trouble he experienced in

lowering the air stairs and by the fact he was not provided

a 'Knapsack but rather a small white canvas

bag which he had

to affix to her person utilizing parachute shroud lines from

unused parachute.

The plane departed Sea-Tac at 7:36 PM. Some four

or five minutes after take-off,l

was sent to the

cockpit by the hijacker.

ten minutes after she entered

the cockpit, one of the officers received a call on the

interphone from the hijacker, advising he could not get

the air stairs

down.

The pilot then leveled off the aircraft

reduced the air speed.

Within a very short time,

officer's panel showed that the stairs had

• been lowered

approximately five minutes later, (8:05 PM), the officer

contacted the hijacker who said everything was okay. That was

the last communication with the hijacker.

At 8:11 PM, while the plane was at 10,000 feet, the

crew experienced a pressure bump or oscillation and the Cabin

Pressure Rate of Change Gauge also reacted violently and it

was thought, at that time, that the hijacker might have left

the aircraft.

When the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, a chest

pack chute and a back type chute were found on the

plan:.

like a good one.

The missing back pack chute is non-strerable

and anyone utilizing this

type chute would have no chance of

slowing down or picking his spot on which to land.

Also located in sear 18/E of the aircraft at Reno,

was a black clip-on tie which containeda tie clasp described

as yellow gold in color with a white pearl circular stone

in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name

• "Town-

craft" and bore Store #3,

Penneys.

The label in this tie

showed it to be a "Snapper" patent type tie.

Investiga-

tion in las Vegas indicated that this type sold for about

, that it was about a year to a year and a half old,

busboys and bartenders. Stewardess

has said that

this tie was probably the Unsub's and other witnesses have

indicated that he wore a similar type tie.

Located in the ashtray utilized by the Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter tip cigarettes and

the eighth cigarette is probably the same.

These cigarettes

are sold in a "soft pack".

The two seats which she had observed to be oc

cupied by the unknown subject were processed for fingerprints.

In addition the telephone, the area around the rear door,

the rear door and four plastic drinking glasses found in

the trash receptacle by

• the back door were also processed

for fingerprints.

In addition, a cloth towel affixed to the

rear of one of the seats reportedly occupied by the unknown

subject was removed and examined by Reno Agents.

On that

towel was noted what appeared to be a short human hair.

The FBI Laboratory by communication dated Decem-

ber 9, 1971, advised that an examination of the tower sub-

mitted by the Las Vegas Office, disclosed a brown head hair

clipping and a brown lim hair,

The report continued that the head hair clipping is suitable

for significant comparison results, but that the limb hair

possesses to few unique microscopic characteristics to be

of value for that purpose.

The Laboratory also advised that the hairs obtain-

ed from the towel have

been mounted on a glass microscopic

slide.

They suggested that if microscopic comparisons between

b6

between the head hair clipping and a known head hair sample

were desired, that the glass microscopic slide containing

the hair clipping should be resubmitted to the Laboratory

by the Las Vegas Office.

The contents of the ashtray, the towel and the

microscopic slide were returned by the Laboratory to the

Las Vegas Office

and are being held by the Las Vegas Divi-

sion as

evidence.

The package

A check of the Federal Aviation Administration

flight section at Portland International Airport reflected

that on November 24, 1971 between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM,

there was

a ceiling

; of 5,000 feet, 3,500 feet broken clouds,

and at 1,500 feet scattered and broken clouds at times

a wind of 12-14 knots.

The temperature at the end of

the air stairs at the time of the jump was approximately

Northwest Orient Airlines, Minneapolis-Saint Paul Interna-

tional Airport, advised he authorized a finers fee of

$25,000 total reward or 15% for any portion of the ransom

money

that is returned.

In addition, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, a

On 1/6/72, the NYA 727 which was actually involved

in the hijacking, was flown to Seattle, byl

for the purpose

of conducting a test to see if the "pressure

bump" experienced during the hijacking, was caused by some-

leaving the aircraft.

The conclusion from that test was that the cabin

pressure change occurred when the stairs were forced upward

air pressure after the weight had been removed.

according to

who was a member of

the hijacked

and also a member of the crew when

the test was performed,

the occurrence was identical with

the incident on the night of the hijack. Also the

instrument in the cabin which reacted so violently on

night of the hijacking, also reacted the same way when

test was performed.

I based on the test flight above,

then prepared a memo showing the steps by which he arrived

at the best probable bail out point of the hijacker, and

plotted this area on a map.

It is based on the following:

— Aircraft position from USAF rader data from McChord AFD furnished by

- Probabic jump time (0411 GMT) from an analysis of the recorded communication

from the flight iclitive 10 the cabin prescure fluctuation. Flight tests conducted

on January & confirined that the pre. are fluctuation almost certainly occurred at

the time the HJ loft the airplane.

• Wind information from 10,000' MiSL to the ground as determined by

NWAL

- Human bedy traitories from data furniched by The Boring Corpany (free-fal)

(parechute open condition) who is anexpert para--

chutist.

- Time correlation from the above USAF radar information and froth the NWA

communications network tope recording.

— Airplane airspeed and altitude from the airplane's flight recorder.

The plot is explained as follows:

1. The heavy dashed line G-D-E-S defines the airpland's probable ground irack.

2. Line G-1m1-K defines the westernmost, and Ling L-M-N-O the easternmost

probable airpiane ground tracks based on the stated position tolerance of #5

nautical mile of the USAF radar plot.

3. Linss A-B, H-P, and O-R ore the average wind vectors between 10,000' MSL and the

ground, and are the lines parallel to which the HJ would drift after the parachute had

opened.

4. Line H-S-T defines the northernmost (earliest) points over which the HS probably

left the airplane. Line K-F-0 defines the southernmost (latest) points over which

the no probably leit the airplane. The north-south span of possible jump positions

is a product of the radar position tolerance of $.5 mile, and the possible communication

time determination tolerance of $1 minute.

5. The area within the boundary defined by Points H-P-Q-R-O-K-J-/-H marks the

extreme limits of probable landing points based on the above tolerances. That is, assumirg

the highest probable degree of inaccuracy in aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, eic.,

all probable lJ landing points would lie within the area defined by this lins.

S. If it is assumed aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, and other inputs used are all

accurate (without allowance for the above stated tolerances):

a. The H's landing point would be at Poin: A if his 'chute did not open, or if he

opened it so soon that tie high speed caused "chute damage that resulted in the

equivalent of a froe-fall io the ground. (The horizontal body trajectory due to

of the area delined by Points A-B-l-J-4.

- It seems highly unlitely-though possible--that the landing point is north of ihe Lawis

FIRST TERRAIN SEARCH

The purpose of the first terrain search was to

search for possible evidence left behind by Unsub and to

find the remains of Unsub assuming he made an unsuccessful

jump. The first terrain seanch commenced at 2:00 PM or

March 21, 1972 with 218 Army troops including officers,

20 Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and 9 helicopters. The area to be searched covered approxi

mately 25 square miles.

Due to snowfall in search area on March 25, 1972,

the search was temporarily held up. Army troops remained

on location and the search resumed at 12:00 Noon on

March 26, 1972. The search was temporarily discontinued

at 12:00

Noon March 30, 1972 to allow search personnel to

rest and enjoy the Easter Holiday. The Army search equip-

ment was retained at search headquarters at Merwin Park.

The search racommenced 7:15 AM, April 8, 1972,

with 265 Army personnel and 20 Agents.

snow,

sleet and

freezing rain hampered search on April 12, 1972. Remaining

areas to be searched were reached only by helicopter in-

sertion of search personnel and landing zones in most

cases were under 6 to 12 inches of snow.

The search of the entire area was completed at

1:00 PM, April 17, 1972 with nothing found.

HUNTERS SEARCH

Prior to the 1972 hunting season, the following

information was made available to Washington State Game

Wardens who

supervise

the area into which the hijacker

parachuted:

"On November

24, 1971, a man parachuted into the

below-described area with $200,000 in $20 bills. If, while

SECOND TERRAIN SEARCH

In attempt to determine the accuracy of the first

search area, the following was learned:

latitude

Using the new system,

Northwest Orient Airlines

plotted a new course

the NORJAK airplane and a new search area based on the new

course.

The new seanch area based on the new course.

new search area is partially outside the first area. (See

maps.)

It is felt that if Unsub's parachute opened, he

is no longer in the southweat Washington area, but if his

parachute did not open he would be in a corridor along

the flight path.

The time of jump is known, and an area

approximately one mile by seven miles represents the are.

Unsub would have landed in if his parachute did noc open.

Because some of the above corridor fell in the

old or first terrain search area, only an area 2 miles by

1/2 mile was searched during the

second terrain search.

The second terrain search commenced March 12,

1973, and involved 10 Special Agents of the Seattle Office.

It was temporarily interrupted on March 16 and resumed again

March 26, 1973.

The second terrain search was completed March 29,

1973 with nothing found.

FAA RECORDS

The Seattle Division advised the Bureau by Nitel

on June 8, 1972 of the following information concerning

the Federal Aviation Administration records for licensed

pilots:

In considering the feasability of checking FAA

records for all licensed pilots, the Oklahoma City Office

has advised that FAA Aeronautical Center maintains records

of over 850,000 licensed pilots.

These records are filed

by name or lIcense certificate number, but not by age.

Further, they do not include photographs of each licensed

pilot.

The FAA at Oklahoma City advises that records

permanently maintained at FAA on those pilots whose licenses

have been revoked, expired

or lapsed.

The following flight configuration was

used during the Boeing air stairs test:

Speed - 125 knots

Flaps - 25° down

Altitude - 10,000 feet.

In Seattle report of SA CHARLES E. FARRELL,

February 16, 1972, it is noted that Unsub requested the

following flight configuation prior to taking off from

Seattle-Tacoma Airport:

Gear down

Flaps - 150 down

Altitude - 10,000 feet

Aft door open and the air stairs down.

When it was explained to the hijacker that the

plane could not take off with the air stairs down, he ra-

portedly said in a low voice,

"Yes they can, but the cockpit can

put it down after they get airborne."

Jadvised that if the hi-

the Boeing Test Team, he would have known that the 127 could

not have taken off with the air stairs down, nor would it have

be

been necessary since the air stairs can easily be lowered in

the dynamite, took control last night of the Calgary to

Montreal flight carrying 123 persons. Claining to be a member

of the Irish Republican Army, the man demanded

denied that the hijacker belonged to the I.R.A.)

to the hijacker by a policenoman.

The money was raised

by bankers as the plane circled the oity for two hours.

"The plane then took off for a scheduled stop in

Regina, Saskatchewan, to let the 114 passengens aboard

disembark.

The plane did not land in Regina, however, but

turned back and set down in Great Falls again where the

passengers and three of the nine crew members were set free.

"On its second take-off from Great Falls, Air

Canada officials said the hijucker wanted to be taken to

New York City before proceeding to Ireland.

The man, des-

cribed as 5-feet-7, dark-haired and in his 30's then

decided he wanted to go to Phoenix, Arizona, but finally

settled for Calgary.

reconnaissance plane which would photograph a

strip 20 miles wide with photographic resolution of detecting

objects on the ground 2

The film strip would

then be reviewed by trained and qualified U.S. Air Force

personnel.

By communication Februany 17, 1972 the Sacramento Di-

vision

advised that photographic over-flights using SP-71

aircraft were conducted on five separate occasions with no

photographs obtained due to limited visibility from very high

altitude. |

_SR-71 Flights

from Beale Air Force Pase advised each such flight requires

minimum of one week advance clearance with FAA due to sonic

boom problem, specialized computer programming of aircraft,

filing of flight plan and compliance with FAA requirements.

Accordingly, weather on flight date cannot be accurately

predicted.

He stated no future flights over specific area

where hijacker possibly exited could'be schueduled since SR-71

aircraft committed

for military missions.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with hin,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-descrited attache case supposedly contained

a bomb. It is believed Unsu! threw, this attache case from

the plane prior to his jumping,

because of the nunerous other

items he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to jumping,

it would fall almost directly in the path of the aircraft.

The 727 air stairs were lowered sometine after 7:42 p.m. and

Unsub Jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24, 1971.

The

plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles during

this time.

The itens cuuld possibly be lodged in thickly

wooded,

mountainous terrain.

The search area would cover a

strip of

land approxinately

87 miles long by one-half mile wide.

It

has been suggested that infrared photography might possibly

indicate non-living material, such as an attache case, in a

darker shade than living material, thereby enabling the case

to be found using infrared high resolution photography.

Since Unsub possibly discarded the attache case

prior to jumping, he could not have buried or hidden it.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. The

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case of any

other time is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the area

covered is relatively small when compared to the entire

flight path.

individuals above, each of whom has had consideral le experience

with infrared imagery, that efforts to locate the attache casc

by this means would probably prove futile.

The terrain, as

described, would neutralize any effort, particularly if

tall

trees and

mountains are part of its makeup.

Further explained

was the

necessity for the presence of heat

which would

need

to be generated by the object (attache case) in contrast to

the surrounding terrain for successful infrared high resolution

photography.

The size of the attache case provides a poor

target for any type of aerial photography, including visual

photography.

All three individuals interviewed continued to

express their negative feelings as to the success of either of

the aerial photography procedures in this particular instance.

The Alezandria Division was requested to determine

the feasibility of routing a visual aerial photography training.

mission over the area of

interest.

Alexandria advised by

aintel dated Februarv 8. 1973, that

was contacted and he advised that

he had made inquiry into this

matter and stated that in the

event Seattle wished to have military assistance in this matter

then seattle should request the Director to submit a letter

of request to the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense,

Office of the Secretary of Defense, Pentazon, Washington, D.C.

In this letter the full particulars of the matter should

be set forth as well as whether or not the Puneau or Nepartment

of justice is willins to observe the additional cost if any

to the Air Force.

advised that

he could not state

positively that the request would be granted, however, advised

that it was his opinion that if this were to be a reimbursable

project, that it would probahly receive more favorable action.

However, in any event, upon receipt of the letter a conference

would be held within the appropriate military organization to

ascertain the feasibility of such missions and the Rureau would

be properly notified.

In view of the above information no further request

was made to have a visual aerial photography training mission

at this time.

Consideration may he given to this type of

survey if new methods or monies become available.

T8 INDORSER

[JI AN UNADLE TO EVALUATE THIS OFFICER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:

Lieutenant Countryman has the ability and knowledge to be a fine Military Police

Orticer, However, too frequently he has attempted to do so many outside jobs that he

has not properly carried out his duties with the unit and could not be relied upon to

attend the necessary administration drills. Upon discussing the matter, he chose to

concentrate on his civilian positions of employment over his military obligations.

This officer's conduct during off duty hours at ANACDUTRA greatly impaired his ability

to carry out his assigned responsibilities.

PART Ill - MANNER OF PERFORHANCE (Road paragraph 21c, AR 623-105)

13. RATER

During the short period of tine that I have observed Captain Countryman, he has

exhibited very few qualities that are desired of an officer.

He is a personable in-

dividual who makes friends easily and willingly participates in official and serioff-

icial social functions. He has shown on many occasions that he accepts statements

from subordinates as complete fact and truth, lithout sufficient verification. This

resulted in deficiencies on the Annual General inspection, which were outlined as

deficiencies previous to the AGI.

Captain Countryman, upon assumin; comtiand of the

142d Military Police Corpany, was

properly counseled by the revieving officer an the

rating officer. During the

period of time covered by this report, it has been neces-

sary for further counseling by the rating, indorsing and reviewing officer, which has

produced no noticeable results. He has not been able to realize and accept the respon-

sibilities which are required for his position and grade.

Unless there is a subsequent

decided improvement in Captain Coust

102104e,

extension of his

present tour of active duty.

TO. INDORSER

[Ji AM UNABLE TO EVALUATE THIS OFFICER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:

I concur with the remarks and rating given by the rating officer. Captain

Countryman has failed to produce and has not established that he can produce. He is

outwardly aware of what must be done, acknowledges same but fails to follow through.

His behavior pattern while off duty in terms of the company with which he had associate

until counseled, left much to be desired and was not conductive to establishing himself!

as an officer leader. Officer's performance and development should be closely monitor-

ed in terms of retention beyond this tour.

DUTY ASSIGNMENT FOR RATED PERIOD

I1- PRINCIPAL DUTY

Company Commander.

Comnanding Officer of a lOr Military Police Company. Has duties

and responsibilities of administration, training and logistics of personnel and equip-

ment assigned. Supports Provost Marshal Operations in two major subordinate command

areas; Pusan Base Command and laegu Base Command, to cover a total area of approxima-

tely

t e1o 30,000 square miles.

PART III - MANNER OF PERFORMANCE (Read paragraph 21c, AR 623-105)

In the beginning, GPT Countryman experienced difficulty in adjusting to full-time

military life, however, he has shown a very definite improvement during this rated

period.

It is felt that part of the problem initizlly was lack of confidence in hirself

to perform his duties to the satisfaction of his superiors which resulted in many cases

in lack of action causing the results to be unsatisfactory. Now when shortcomings con-

cerning himself or his unit are brought to his attention he immediately takes correc

tion action.

He has improved his unit from an unsatisfactory unit on Chlit inspections

to a satisfactory status.

CPT Countryman has demonstrated he works well with projects

connected with Special Services type work.

He presents an outstanding appearance,

mixes well, and is very socially inclined. I feel he has improved so significantly

ing this rated period he should be considered for retention on active duty upon comple-

tion of his present commitmention: SPECIAU HANDIING REQUIRED

02 disseminato In its original formoutside

1 AN UNADLE TO EVALUATE THIS OFFICER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:

CPT Countryman has shown a definite improvement in performance of duty during the

past few months.

He has begun to take the initiative whenever discrepancies are dis-

covered in his unit and install procedures which will prevent their recurrence. His

unit has improved significantly in overall proficiency to the point that it is consider

Captain in the U.S. Army.

However, CPT Countryman has made great strides in adjuctiu

and addpting to Army life in the past few months, and he has shown an avaran ad as fu

the responsibilities and the functions of an Army officer.

I feel that it ho contir.:

to improve and apply himself, as he has in the past few months, he should la potato u

on active duty after completion of his present commitment.

Company Commander.

Commanding Officer of a TOE Military Police Company. Has duties

and responsibilities of administration, training and logistics of personnel and equip-

Supports Provost Marshal Operations in two major subordinate command

areas; Pusan Base Command and l'aegu Base Command, to cover a total area of approxima-

cely 36.000 square miles.

A. MAJOR ADDITIONAL DUTTES

PART I1t - MANNER OF PERFORMANCE (Roud paragraph 21c, AR 623+105)

IB. RATER

In the beginning, CPT Countryman experienced difficulty in adjusting to full-time

military life, however, he has shown a very definite improvement during this rated

period.

It is felt that part of the problem initially was lack of confidence in himself

to perform his duties to the satisfaction of his superiors which resulted in many cases

in lack of action causing the results to be unsatisfactory. Now when shortcomings con-

cerning himself or his unit are brought to his attention he imnediately takes correc-

tion action.

He has improved his unit from an unsatisfactory unit on Crit inspections

to a satisfactory status. IPT Countryman has demonstrated he works well with projects

connected with Special Services type work.

He presents an outstanding appearance,

mixes well, and is very socially inclined. I feel he has improved so significantly

dur-

ing this rated period he should be considered for retention on active duty upon comple-

tion of his present commitment.

16 IHDORSER

EJI AM UNABLE TO EVALUATE THIS OFFICER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:

CPT Countryman has shown a definite improvement in performance of duty during the

past few months.

He has begun to take the initiative whenever discrepancies are dis

covered in his unit and install procedures which will prevent their recurrence. His

unit has improved significantly in overall proficiency to the point that it is consider

ed a satisfactory unit as compared to the unsatisfactory rating for the first few months

he was commanding. CPT Countryman is a reserve officer who has never been on active

duty and he does not possess the experience necessary to function efficiency as a

Captain in the U.S, Army. However, CPT Countryman has made great strides in adjusting

and adapting to Arny life in the past few months, and he has shown an awareness as to

the responsibilities and the functions of an Army officer.

I feel that in ha contim

to improve and apply himself, as he has in the past few months, he should to rotained

on active duty after completion of his present commitment.

PART I11 - MANNER OF PERFORMANCE (120ad paragraph 21c, MR 623-105)

IB. RATER

CPT Countryman has performed his duties in a superior manner during

this rating period. Through his untiring efforts, patience and determination, his

unit passed the annual Command Maintenance Management Inspection with a very

high rating. He has worked unceasingly to improve the welfare of unit personnel

by improving living and messing facilities. His efforts have resulted in a vast

improvement in the morale of unit personnel. In his capacity as battalion S-1,

he has rendered valuable assistance to the battalion commander and provost

marshal by his efficient supervision of administrative actions. He has served

as

Chief of the Personnel Directorate Command inspection team. His work in this

capacity resulted in favorable comments from members of the inspection party

,and of the inspected unit for his thoroughness. CPT Countryman accepts

responsibility readily and cheerfully assumes additional tasks. He has

developed

rapidly in his knowledge of unit administration and in staff procedures at the

special staff level. He has gained the respect of his subordinates and contem-

poraries by a maturity of judgment seldom found in an officer of his grade and

experience. He demands high standards of performance from his subordinates

and himself. CPT Countryman works with little supervision and canti expected

16. INDORSER

JI AM UNAULE TO EVALUATE THIS OFFICER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON

During rated period Captain

Countryman proved to be a competent commander

and a good manager.

As an additional duty he acted as Team Chief of the Personnel

Directorate Command Inspection Team and in this capacity he organized and super-

vised the team in a superior manner. Captain Countryman is responsive, willingly

accepts and acts on constructive criticism and is able to accomplish his assigned

taske within established time limits and with minimum direct supervision. Captain.

Countryman is professionally qualified to serve in the next higher grade.

The Crime

A lone white male

• boarded Northwest

Orient Airlines Flight No. 305 at

Portland, Oreg., on November 24,

1971. At approxinately 3:22 p.m.,

while the flight was en route to Seat-

tle, Wash, he indicated to a stew-

ardess that his briefcase contained a

bomb which would blow up the plane

unless his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000

and four parachutes in exchange for

the safely of the 36 passengers

aboard the plane. When the aircraft

Janded at Seattle, Northwest Orient

Airlines complied with his instruc-

tions. After he received the parachutes

and money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two of the airline

stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the icmaining crew

members into the first-class section of

the aircraft and informed them he

desired to fly to Mexico City. The hi-

jacker instructed that the plane pro-

ceed in a southerly direction and fy at

a low altitude and slow speed which en-

abled the rear door of the planc to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out

somewhere between Seattle and Reno,

Nev., where, when the plane landed, it

was determined that "Cooper," to

parachutes, and the ransom money

had disappeared.

Artist conception drawings of the

aircralt hijacker were prepared by the

His hair is not black

You can find out if he worked at the mine then and if he was there,

this man has gained weight since he came here and isn't real tall.

and interviewed at his residence

and provided the fol-

lowing information:

advised that on Saturday, March 11,

1978, at approximately 7:55 p.m., a male individual

called his residence with the following information:

"I am a friend of Jack (Dick) Cofoldt

(phonetic) who I understand is a friend of

yours.

Jis circulating

your (or a) letter around Hollywood and

trying

to implicate you in the D. B. Cooper

crime.

at this time told the caller he did

not know a JACK or DICK COFELDT and in attempting to ques-

tion the caller as to his identity was told that he would

not identify himself and in fact stated it was not impor-

tant for

to know who he was, only that he was

warning him about the letter thatl

rently circulating around Hollywood.

at this time stated that

had contacted him in Toledo, Ohio,

during the

summer

of 1977 and represented himself as

UNITED PRODUCTION LIMITED, 3921 Deervale Drive, Sherman

Oaks, California, 91403, and was trying to make a docu

mentary film or movie about the D. B. COOPER hijacking.

_that he had approval of NORTHWEST

AIRLINES and would like him to be a consultant for the

movie so that it could be as authentic as possible.

at that time advised that he would consider

such an endeavor but would have to give it additional

thought and in fact he immediately contacted NORTHWEST

AIRLINES in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he learned

that NORTHWEST AIRLINES

was not cooperating in such an

endeavor and in fact was very much against the making of

such a falm or movie.

The word is out that the identity of the

nation's most legendary sky bandit has

finally been discovered. A CBS "60

Minutes" reporter was in town recently

interviewing witnesses to the 1970

skyjack and has got some positive

identifications. The story that has leaked

out is that the mysterious Mr. Cooper was

a Northwest native who died a year or so

' ago of natural causes. Apparently a

friend of the bandit tried to sell the story

to a Hollywood producer, who in turn

tipped CBS. Remember, you read it here

Insiders estimate that Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s

reelection war chest will reach the $420,000 mark by income-

raised through a series of private cocktail parties and other

small, exclusive gatherings-most of them held in the south-

ern portion of the state, where the Field Poll reveals Brown is

strongest.

More traditional fund-raising dinners will be held up and

down the state, starting in the middle of this month, to produce

an expected $400,000 more for Brown's coffers. By primary

time, Brown is likely to have raised almost $1.2 million-much of

which will be earmarked for the general election.

Referenced airtel.instructs that.any additional

press inquiries concerning this 6-1/2.year old investigation

•be referred to the Seattle Division for handling and sets

forth the text of what seattle considers the only information

that should be released to the press:

Portland concurs in the theory that all sedia

inquiries be handled by one bureau spokesman in any investiga-

tion which has national. or regional interest.

Certainly

NORJAK falls within this area and Seattle, as office of

origin, should indead respond to all media inquiries to the

extent deened appropriate by Seattle and the Bureau.

Portland feels, however; that its media credibility

will not be enhanced with this posture in this case at this

point in time: As the Bureau and 'Seattle are aware, Portland,

at Bureau instructions, has been responding since: NORJAR began

to the national media inquiries, including cooperation in

a 30-minute TV docuentary: Further, Portland case Agent;

again at Bureau request, responded to a background type

Interview by.

representingl

for "60 Minutes,

" CBS, New York, on 5/4/78, just prior

•to the issuance of retel.

For the Portland Division at this point in time: to

take a non-cooperative posture with the media can only diminish

the credibility of this Division's media relations, not to

mention the overall Bureau crefibility with the media.

...I

am confident that the information released prior to my arxival

in the Portland Division and am equally certain: that the

information released subsequent to my arrival in the Portland

Division has in no way invaded the privacy of witnesses or

otherwise had any adverse affect on thé prosecutive potential

of this case:

To the contrary, it has been the notoriety

generated by. Portland's cooperation with the media that has

maintained a steady flow of information coming from the general

public.

It can be readily understood that the. failure to solv

this case is not the 'type of publicity which any individual

office of the bureau as a whole would be soliciting. with the

lack of positive investigative leads, the cooperation of the

public is for all practical purposes the only source of informa-

thon which may lead to the solution, of the case.. The text of.

the release suggested by. Seattle certainly does not give the

po to come source of leade in this matter? a full profile of

B.: COOPER."-

It is Portland's recoumendation that the Bureau adopt

the general policy of one sureau spokesman in any investigation

which has national or regional interest and that the information

to be released be coordinated by the sic of that office and the

Public Affairs Office at FBIHQ, and that this practice and

procedure be established at the outset of the investigation to

preclude the very reasons that are articulated by Seattle in

retel.

obviously, it then becomes the responsibility of the

spokesnan office to meet the entire media responsibilities

for the Bureau.ag

a whole for the life of the investigation:

reasons stated above, to merely reply "no comment", and

again refer to the fact that this was a pending investigation

prove or disprove that a particular individual is or is

not the Unsub.

probably too much information had already been released but

this was a most unusual case. I also suggested that per-

haps

"60 Minutes"

could do a

positive story about all of

the other hijacking cases which we had solved rather than

a negative story about one which is still being investi-

gated.

I pointed out that this is an on-going investigation

which has gone into the background of almost 950 suspects

with approximately 910 of them being cleared and that this

information is contained in almost 100 volumes of files.

He implied that we had fully cooperated with other

news media representatives in this matter to which I replied

that insofar as I was concerned, we had given all of the

representatives about the same

information.

I also brought

to his attention the fact that the last time the FBI had

cooperated with "60 Minutes", one of the narrators had in-

sisted on an interview with CLARENCE M. KELLEY, the then

Director of the FBI, immediately after he had suffered a

great personal tragedy.

I commented

that this interview

was supposed to summarize Mr. KELLEY's thoughts on the

Bureau, the changes which he had instituted, morale, etc.,

and that after granting the interview, which covered a

period of about 2½ hours (actual time believed to be closer

to 14 hours, i told second of the interview was contained

in the show.

_ that in my opinion, his program

lost a lot of credibility among Bureau personnel because

of such action. At that point, he jokingly held his hands

up as if in surrender and indicated that he had nothing to

do with that particular program.

I further pointed out tol

that no matter how

much "60 minutes" wished to theorize,

take things out of

context, "voice over-ride" my statements or any other Bureau

representative, it was in their power to either make us 100k

good or bad on

this investigation and that we had no recourse

or platform to publicly rebutt any misquotes, incorrect in-

terences,

etc. I noted, however, that the bottom line, inso-

far as this or any other investigation in which the Bureau

suspect is or is not identical with the Unsub and that if

we release all of our "Identifiers" to the general public

through the news media, it becomes virtually impossible to

prove the case in a court of law.

In summary,

I am sure, expected to virtually

be given a free hand in this

matter but I feel certain that

he understands our position. In all honesty, we cooperated

with him as much as we could and gave him no more but no less

than we have given any other media representative.

furnished the name of the author of a locally written book

about the case ("The Ballad of D.B. Cooper - Skyiacker" bv

EMMETT WATSON), and furnished the identity of

of Malibu, California, who had pre-

Viously done a discreet inquiry for Warner Brothers about

the person, JAMES BRYANT COFFELT, who has been alleged to

be the Unsub in this case.

For the information of the Bureau, JAMES BRYANT

COFFELT has previously served time in a number of prisons

and

while

During their prison association and subsequent to their re-

lease, COFFELT, who is now deceased, apparently

to believe that he was actually D.B. COOPER.

Extensive in-

vestigation by the Bureau has virtually eliminated COFFELT as

being the Unsub; however,

nave worked with

(who was des-

cribed as a freelance writer, formerly associated with CBS

based Angeles, Canternia)

in preparing a script/stors

interpretation of what COFFELT told him.

Apparently considerable money has changed hands in the obtaining

of the story and preparation of the script with COFFELI try-

ing tol

Jin turn, got money from

recently as last month, United Press International reported

a story raising the question that D.B. COOPER was Involved in

the assassination of Rev. DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. It

is felt that such sensational allegations will continue to

emanate from

and his

associates in order to try to

get the NORJAK case on "60 Minutes" or some other TV Show.

For the information of the Bureau, NBC also considered using

the COFFELT story but declined it unofficially because it

did not believe COFFELT was the Unsub.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

With regard to Portland Airtel, it is not felt that

there is any point in disecting that communication and rehash-

ing its inferences. Suffice it to say that this matter has

personally been discussed by me with the SAC in Portland, who

agrees that this case, as in all other cases, should have the

Office of Origin as the spokesman.

Therefore, and in order

to avoid any further conflicts and mis-statements, it is

recommended that: 1) Portland Office, if it has

not al-

ready been done by the SAC, specifically advise SAl

_that he should refer all inquiries regarding

this investigation to Seattle; 2) that if Portland feels

that this will have a detrimental effect on their credibility

with the Media as noted in Portland Airtel of 5/8/78, Bureau

should consider designating Portland as Office of Origin,

noting that

an indictment was obtained in that Division;

3) that serious consideration be given to discouraging CBS

from pursuing this investigation for a myriad of reasons,

not the least of which is that this is a pending

where there are a limited number of "identifiers" left which

have not been released to the public and to show how we

have eliminated some of the suspects (specifically COFFELT) ,

could jeopardize the investigation.

In addition we should

keep in mind the manner in which "60 Minutes" treated the

FBI the last time we cooperated with that program.

Also, we

should recognize that CBS is a

"past master" of utilizing

inuendoes, flashbacks, conflicting testimony, etc.

sensationalize any story.

Seattle will continue to act as spokesman for the

Bureau in this

important investigation, UACB.
