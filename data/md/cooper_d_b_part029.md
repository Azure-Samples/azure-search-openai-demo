At approximately 2:20 PM today SA MANNING received

At approximately 2:23 PM, the same individual re-

case.

I asked MANNING if he had any idea who the caller

As the result of the Seattle file review

currently in progress, the following investigation has

been initiated:

On the premise that unsub parachuted

successfully into the previously calculated area of

southwest washington, it is spectulated he would have

buried the coney and

his parachute and then hiked to

the rearest road or highway. From there, he would most.

probably have walked to the nearest phone booth and

called a friend or relative for the purpose of being

picked up.

Based on the above, all the pay phones

surrounding the calculated drop area within reasonable

walking distance, l.e., 15 miles, are being checked for

Jong distance phone calls made during the evening of

11/24/71 and on the nonning of 11/25/12.
