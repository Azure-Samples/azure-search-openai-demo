SUOCESSFUL SKYJACKING TO DATE.

WHILE HE WAS ALIVE, I

PEOPLE THINKING HE WAS JUST ANOTHER 'SKYJACKER TERRORIST'. BUT

HE WASN'T.

CRIMINAL". HE WAS A KIND AND GENTILE

E HUMAN BEING. HE LOVED LIFE

AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BUT MONTHS

TO LIVE, HE FACED THE NEWS VERY BRAVELY. TALKING DID NO GOOD.

WHAT COULD I SAY? JUST TWO YEARS BEFORE, HE IOST HIS WIFE AND

DAUGHTER. I COULD SENSE A CHANGE COMING OVER HIM. HE WAS FACED

WITH DEATH. BUT SOMETHING ELSE WAS ON HIS MIND. WHEN HE FIRST

TOLD ME ABOUT THE JOB, I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING. HE WASN'T. AFTER

ALI, HE HAD NOTHING TO IOSE AND PLENTY TO GAIN.

HOWEVER, MONEY WASN'T THE OBJECT.

KNEW THAT HE

COULD DEMAND ALMOSI ANY AMOUNI AND HE'D PROBABLY GET IT. IN FACT,

WE GAVE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLIARS OF THE

Result of examination:

It was not determined whether the questioned writing

on 249 through 251 was prepared by any of the persons involved

in the preparation of the questioned material previously

received in this matter. A conclusion could not be reachea

in this regard because of a lack of comparable writing and

distortion in postions of the questioned macerial previously

received; however, nothing of particular significance was noted

in the linitea comparison which could be conducted.

049 through 051 wore noc identified in the Anonynous

No watermarks, indented writing, or other features

SOME "D. B. COOPER' GOT $30,000

Weekly's Hijacking Story

Turns Into Tall Tale-Later

BY ALEXANDER AUERBACH

Times Staff Wrller

"What happens to people is news,

What happens to reporters isn't," a

cigar-chewing Boston city editor

to shout at reporters who

turned in first-person accounts of

events they had witnessed.

But what happens if the reporter

is (A) the sleuth who solved one of

the most publicized crimes in recent

history, or (B) the victim of the clev-

erest hoax since Clifford Irving's

bogus

autobiography of Howard

Hughes, or (C) both?

LA, a new weekly newspaper

on the FBI's list of bills that made

up the ransom paid by the airline

serving the Los Angeles area, just

concluded a three-installment series

recounting the "solution" of the suc-

cessful $200,000 hijacking

a

Northwest Orient Airlines jet last

Nov. 24.

Only at the end of the series did :

LA tell its readers that the whole ac-

count was an apparent hoax that

cost the paper's backers $30,000.

Karl Fleming, LA's editor, says he

chose to tell the story in a way that

some readers found misleading in

order to let them vicariously under-

the same experience he did.

Without realizing it, they were read-

• ing a story about Fleming, not simp-

ly by him.

The first installment told of D. B.

Cooper ("an ordinary, God-fearing,

patriotic, country club-oriented, up-

ward-climbing

WASP

engineer")

leaving his suburban Seattle home

with a briefcase stuffed with two

wigs, an altimeter and compass, :

i makeup kit, gloves and three rec

flares wired to look like a dynamitc

bomb.

lad in newspapers around

Oregon and Washington,

asking Cooper to contact

Later, while Fleming and

millionaire Max Palevsky

were organizing LA, an in-

termediary offered to put

the newsman in contact

with Cooper-for $30,000.

Palevsky put up the money

land Fleming flew up to

meet Cooper, dragging

along two tape recorders, a

motion picture camera,

two cameramen and $30,-

000 in cash.

The headline on the

third and final installment

read: "Is D. B. Cooper the

real D. B. Cooper?" There

is considerable reason for

doubt, since the men who

ing — and who allegedly

itook his $30,000 - have

been arrested by the FBI

on charges of defrauding

F'leming of his money.

Arrested Before Story

The arrest took place on

May 2, long before Flem-

ing wrote his story for LA,

Why did Fleming pub-

lish the story in a manner

as I did," Fler, ing says.

"It's an adventure story,

as much about me as

about D. B. Cooper, and I

wanted to put the reader

in my shoes. If the reader

was reasonably alert, h

would have seen in th

ress that these guys ha

been busted by the FBI.

Paid at First Meeting

"I gave him the whol

$30,000 at our first meet

ing, after I was convinced

that this was D. B, Coop-

er;" Fleming says. "At that

point a con man would !

have taken the money and

run like hell, but this guy

came back and

submitted himself to eight

hours of taped interviews,

30 minutes of filmed inter-

views and still photo

graphs. His intermediary

signed a contract (saying

the $50,000 would be used

for Cooper's legal defense)

with his real name and left

his fingerprints ail over

the contract."

The story was to have

been in the opening issue

of LA. To avoid charges of

aiding a fugitive from jus-

lice, Fleming turned

material over to the FBI

to believe that the early

instaliments were the real

thing?

Fleming doesn't feel that

the initial installment was

deceptive, noting that

"there were disclaimers in

it," referring to two lines

near the end: "The fore

going narrative was relat-

if ransom bills but FE

With their trial sched-

Fleming says he still finds

, it "difficult to accept" the

possibility that

was

duped, "I asked that guy

man

could have prepared for,"

he says, "I went over him

like a vacuum cleaner."

Fleming notes that

"Cooper" went into detail

on matters of air naviga-

tion and parachute proce-

dure— unaware that Flem-

ing is a licensed private pi-

lot with some 700 hours in

flight.

He said that when everyone boarded the plane that

it had just started raining quite heavily and that he,

had gotten drenched on his way out to the plane.

He said there was not one of the automatic boarding ramps

used at this particular boarding and everyone simply had

to run from the terminal across the asphalt and to the

plane in order to board.

He said that the flight was uneventful. but that normally

the flight coming in to Seatac, the combined airport for

Seattle and Tacoma, the flight would pass by the airport

somewhat and wuld pass over Seattle and would land in a

southerly direction at Seatac.

At about 3:20 or 3:30 P.M. the pilot said that they would

be landing in about 10 minutes.

At the time

about the starting of Northwest Orient hirlines and one

of the early plane crashes that Northwest Orient Airlines

ticularly unusual happened.

He said that when they landed

that the runway lights were dark and that they were on a

distant part of the runway.

He said that a gas truck

came up on the right-hand side of the plane

and

jokingly remarked to his new companion sitting alongside

they were going to refuel and go back up.

This joke was simply reference to the long time that

they were circling from 3:00 P.M. until 6:00 P.M. and

did not have any inkling that a

skyjacking

was taking place.

He said that they were finally told to

"deplane and told to stand nearby the plane.. They were

then asked to move 30 or 40 feet away and were then

asked to move about 100 feet away from the plane.

He said

that they may have been asked one or two more times to

move a 100 feet in addition or additional increments of

were in the midst of a skyjacking.

At that time someone

in their group said that it must have been the guy in

i To the best of his recollection he said

one of the stevardesses walked back and forth picking up

the parachutes and the money and he. thinks that the

lone automobile driver who undoubtedly was an FBI agent

but claimed to be the chief pilot, perhaps accompanied

her to the plane but did not at any time board the plane.

Later the man claiming to be the chief pilot came back

to the group and the stewardess got on. At that time

the man claiming to be the chief pilot said something to

the effect, "I'm out of it but that girl has got to get

back on that plane with

Result of examination:

It was not determined whether any of the questioned

writing on 01 through Qlo was prepared by ALVIN CURTIS HARILLY,

FBI #796324B, because his fingerprint card signatures are not

adequate to permit a satisiactory handwriting conparison with

this material.

It was not determined whether the person or persons

preparing the questioned writing on &l through Q13 prepared

any of the questioned material in the NORJAK case; however

nothing of particular significance was noted in the limite

comparison which could be conducted.

The submitted evidence was photographed

Leads

concerning

in this report as they are

being

handled by separate con

munication.

There are currently 637 suspects, 170 of whom have

been eliminated. New suspects are being developed and

systematic

elimination of these suspects continues.

In an effort to facilitate interoffice communi-

cations, it is requested that all field offices originating

NORJAK conmunications, not only refer to the appropriate

communications but also include

the suspect(s) name and

alias(es) if known on the first page under the title NORJAK.

for the information of all field offices, the

Bureau advised by airtel September

15, 1972, that this is

the only aircraft hijacking in which the subject has

not

been identified and apprehended nor

the ranson money

recovered. All leads in this important case are to be

set forth

expeditiously. The investigation of this case

15

to be

vigorously pursued in all facets in order to bring

it to a successful completion.

It is

noted that the investigative period overlaps

previous NORJAK reports.

This has been done since previous

reports were not distributed to all field offices.

It is nöted that Unsub in 'this matter is almost

universally called "D. B. COOPER" by the press, the public,

and even by Bureau personnel. Factually, there is no basis

for this alias.

As a possible explanation for the existence

of the

alias "D. B. COOPER" the following sequence of

events

While the hijacking was in progress on the evening

of November 24, 1971, it was established that al

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

This list in no way represents all the means avail-

able to process

a suspect. Each individual case prompts a

different method; one or more of the below listed methods

have been used in the past.

1. Obtain current descriptive data (particularly

useful is age, height-and complexion)

2. Ascertain Iocation on November 24, 1971, by

(a) checking employment records.

(b)

checking cancelled checks of credit card

transactions.

interviewing acquaintances or relatives

(note November 24th was the day before

Thanksgiving, 1971).

3.

Ascertain present location to determine if he

PROFILE

The purpose of the following information is to

conveniently list all the known facts concerning the hi-

jacken's profile and to combine them with suppositions that

can be reasonably inferred from those facts.

The suppositions

have been included to aid in processing a suspect.

should not be considered as concrete facts, nor should they

be used as the sole determining factor in drawing investi-

gative conclusions.

SUMMARY

Unsub was a well spoken, conservative gentleman;

probably a Catholic with Mexican

or Indian blood.

He was

not an

• alcoholic.

He probably lived in the Portland or

Seattle areas or had flown more than once over these areas.

He apparently had no accomplices:

He was not an experienced

skydiver and most probably received his jump training in

the military. His hijacking plan was not well thought out,

and he was probably not an experienced criminal. He was

apparently having financial troubles prior to November,

1973, and he may have previously worked in an airline-

related indus try.

The reasons for the above suppositions are in-

cluded below.

BACKGROUND.

It is felt Unsub was not an experienced criminal

because of his mannerism exhibited after he received the

ransom money.

Unsub reportedly became somewhat childish

in his

actions and comments while counting the money.

• Unsub was familiar with the Seattle area, as

indicated by his comments concerning the plane's location

as it flew over tacoma, Washington.

In addition, Unsub

in relation to Sea-Tac Airport.

Unsub reportedly

Sea-Tac,.

which is essentially correct.

Unsub stated he was hijacking the aircraft

because of a grudge.

He may have had a

relative, possibly

a son, killed in Vietnam or he may have had recent finan-

cial problems which would foster such a grudge.

Unsub's complexion has been described as swarthy

or dark.

The grudge may be

associated with his background

which could possibly be Indian, Mexican or possibly

italian descent

Note unsub has been described by witness

as definitely having some Mexican or Indian

"blood" in him.

It is noted the northwest area at the time of the

hijacking was suffering from a depressed econonic condition,

and since Unsub was familiar with the Seattle area as in-

dicated above, it is possible Unsub was out of work at the

time of NORJAK.

In addition, Unsub demonstrated considerable

knowledge of aircraft and of flying,.

and it is felt he was

employed in the aircraft industry; either civilian or

military at one time in his life,

therefore, it is logical

to assume unsub may possibly have been out of work in an

airlines-related industry.

His actions and reactions that occurred throughout

the hijacking indicate unsub probably was not

Unsub was probably a "loner" and carried out the

hijacking by himself, with no partners. Throughout the

hijacking, he exhibited a competency in reacting to various

an experienced criminal, but a victim of circumstances.

(It is noted

that during the hijacking unsub requested

a knapsack to put

the money in and he received a small white bag instead.

believed unsub was not well prepared for the hijacking and

had not thoroughly thought the hijacking out, he most pró,

bably always carries a small pocket knife with him.

The following information tends to indicate unsub

was somewhat conservative in his

thinking and dress:

1. Short style hair

2. Age mid 40's

3. Dark colored suit, dark colored raincoat,

white shirt, narrow black tie.

4. Unsub did not swear and showed a great deal

of respect for the stewardesses on the

airline because they were women. (Unsub

engaged in a small

argument with one of the

passengers, as well

tense and nervous situations, and through it

all he never used profane language - this

night indicate he is possibly a religious

man.

Since he did drink, and since he is

possibly religious, he probably is not a

Baptist or Mormon.)

The following information:tends to indicate Unsub

possibily possessed athletic ability:

1. His physical build was described as average

to well built, even though his age was

described as in his mid-40's.

2.

Unsub exhibited some physical dexterity using

his hands and a small knife.

3.

Unsub apparently parachuted from an aircraft

at night; something that would require no

small degree of physical ability.

It is felt unsub possibly maintains his physical

well being through regular exercise.

Unsub was a gentleman:

I. He offered to tip the stewardesses on the

NORJAK flight after he received his ransom

money.

He did not offer. them ransom money

as the

tip, but used his own money.

2.

During the entire hijacking he did not use

profane language.

3.

Throughout the hijacking he maintained a calm

demeanor and spoke low and intelligently.

The following information tends to indicate

Unsub lived in the northwest area at some time in his life:

1.

Unsub knew the distance from MoChord to

Sea-Tạc and recognized Tacoma, Washington from

ther air.

2.

Unsub was dressed in a suit and lightweight

overcoat which is commonly worn by many north-

west area residents.

3. No accent or unusual speech mannerisms were

detected by the Northwest Airlines stewardesses

who had a chance to observe him.'

SPORT PARACHUTIST

The hijacker is probably.not a sports parachutist

nor is he a member of a sport parachute club. The reasons

for this

are as follows:

'1. The hijacker requested two back parachutes

and two front parachutes. He gave no specific

instructions as to the type of parachute that

he desired.

(i,e.

a sports parachutist would

'probably have requested a steerable sport

attachment to his parachute

and probably would

not jump from an aircraft with anyone else's

chute, nor would they jump with a chute they

had not packed themselves.

The hijacker was furnished a parachute that

opens quickly, has a high rate of descent, and one that was

not steerable.

3. The hijacker was furnished two front parachutes,

commonly called chest packs which are to be used

in an emergency when the back pack parachute

or main parachute fails to

open properly.

The

chest pack parachute the hijacker took with him

was a dummy parachute.

It was designed for lectures to demon-

strate to new parachutists the proper method of opening a

chest pack parachute.

It is felt an experienced

sports para-

chutist would probably have noticed this defect.

4. Unsub's age has been described as mid 40's

and it is noted that the average age in most

sport parachute clubs is mid 20's.

If Unsub

was a member of a sport parachute club he would

certainly be an unusual member, one that would

be easily recognized by the other members, as el as one that

was well known because of his unusual age.

felt that due

to the large amount of publicity aforded this case, someone

in a sport parachute club would have recognized his IedOW

"sky divez" as being identical with Unsub if in fact Unsub

was

member of any sports parachute club.

When the stewardess presented the parachutes

to the hijacker she also presented an instruction sheet on

how to utilize a parachute. At that time, Unsub stated he

did not need any instructions concerning the use of a

parachute.

Since Unsub did not specify a specific type of

chute

and because of the above reasoning concerning Unsub's

age, it is felt Unsub

was not an experienced jumper or

a sport jumper. In addition, Unsub probably had some jumen

training most probably obtained while in the military,

HABITS

alcoholic. Unsub ordered one bourbon and seven at the be-

ginning of the flight and although he was offered several

free drinks later, he turned them

down.

This would indicate

that Unsub possessed sufficient willpower to refuse alcohol

in a tension-filled

situation.

It is believed an alcoholic

or a former alcoholic who had just had one drink and was

placed in a situation of similar stress would succumb to the

pressure and imbibe in the free drinks offered him by the

stewardesses.

Located in the ashtray utilized by Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven

of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter cigarettes, and

the eighth cigarette

is possibly the same.

ettes are sold ina

eight hours in

an extremely tense situation. During the

eight hours, he had eight cigarettes.

A two-pack-a-day

smoker would have consumed 20 cigarettes in eight hours

under normal circumstances. It

is felt Unsub may possibly

smoke

less than one pack a day.

CLOTHES

.

Located in Seat 18 E (the seat Unsub occupied)

was a black clip-on tie which contained a tie clip des-

cribed as yellow gold in. color, with a white pearl circular

stone in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name

"Towncraft" and bore the legend "Store 3; Penneys".

The

label in this tie showed it to be

• "Snapper" patent type

tie.

Investigation at Las Vegas indicated this type tie

was sold for about $1.50 and that this particular tie was

about a year to a ayear and a half old.

It was a favorite

item for individuals such as waiters, busboys and barten-

ders.

Stewardess

has said that this tie, found

on the aircraft, was probably Unsubs and other witnesses have

indicated he wore a similar type tie.

However, since the

tie was narrow and a

not on a tod-level executive

Unsub carried with him a cheap briefcase that

appeared to be new.

It is thought the hijacker probably

purchased this briefcase just prior to the hijacking to be

used during the hijacking only.

Unsub"

wore a white

shirt with small collar points

indicating he probably did not have the money to obtain :

nore fashionable wardrobe (i.e, more colonful shirts with

larger collars currently in style). The white shirt could

also

indicate the hijacker's conservative taste in clothing.

EDUCATION

Unsub was accessed to be a high school graduate

possibly with some college training, based primarily on

vocabulary used

stewardesses as during the hijack.

Further, Unsub impressed

possibly being experienced in dealing

with

people.

They, therefore, concluded he was the executive

type and seemed to naturally dictate. the ransomed demands

to the stewardesses in lieu of writing the notes out himself.

The Unsub, aka

Lat 2:00 PM, Pacific

Standard Time, November 24, 1971, purchased a one-way coach

ticket at the Portland International Airport, Portland,

Uregon, for travel from Portland to Seattle, Washington,

on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight Number 305, which was

a Boeing 121 aircraft.

Unsub paid for this flight with a

twenty dollar bill and had no luggage. He occupied seat

number 18 E on the aircraft.

The Boeing 727 has three seats on each side of

the aisle. Row 18 is the last one on both the right and

left side of the aisle.

seats are identified from left

to right as you face the front of the aircraft with A,B,C

on the left side of the aisle and D (aisle seat), E (center seat)

and F (window seat) on the right side.

Almost flush against the back of row 18, except

for some eight inches near the aisle, is a bulkhead which

forms the wall for the lavatories, located behind row 18;

one on the right and one on the left.. Beyond the

lavatory

doors is the door leading to the air stairs.

The door to the air stairs is always closed and

locked, except when loading or unloading passengers. It is

located straight away at the end of the aisle beyond row 18

and is perhaps some 3½ feet from the last now and is in

easy reach fos someone sitting in row 18.

• Built into the lower portion of the door to the

air stairs is the stewardess

seat which is pulled down when

in use, so that a person sitting in that seat looks straight

down the aisle toward the front of the aircraft. On take-off

this seat-was occupied by Stewardess l

• Prior to the time the aircraft taxied on the run-

way, he purchased a. bourbon and Seven Up from Stewardess

As the aircraft taxied toward the runway for

takeoff, Unsub turned and handed Stewardess

envelope containing a note written in black felt-tip pen on

plain white unlined paper which said:

"Miss, I have a bomb here and I would like you to

sit by me".

The hijacker then dictated the following:

"Put it in a knapsack. I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes" (no other specification concerning para-

"When we land I want a fuel truck ready

to refuel" (probably his flying experience caused him to

add this›.

"No funny stuff

or I'll do the job" (the first

attempted

parachute skyjacking had been foiled about 12

days earlier by the hijacked

aircraft's crew.)

The hijacker showed both Stewardesses the contents

of his briefcase and stated it was an electrical device and

requested

I the aircraft radio be used as little as possible.

The hijacker explained.why he hijacked this plane

by stating

• "it's not because I have a grudge against the

airlines, it's because I have

a grudge."

The hijacker then added that the flight suited

his time, place and plans (probably the convenience of a

Portland

to Seattle flight suited the hijacker).

The hijacker very carefully demanded that each and

every note either written by him or dictated to the stewardess

by him be returned to him and he also had a used match cover

which was used to convey notes returned to him.

Stewardess

showed Stewardess

the demand notes and then went to the cockpit where she

displayed them to the captain of the aircraft.

She thereafter

remained in the cockpit where she prepared thirteen pages of

notes concerning the hijacking.

The aircraft landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 PM, PST, at

which time $200,000. in twenty dollar bills, weighing 19 pounds,

two back chutes

and two chest chutes were given to him in a

white canvas bag.

as were Stewardess

The passengers then were allowed to deplane

and another stewardess.

The hijacker went to the lavatory just behind row

18 (the now he which he was sitting)

and as he exited the

lavatory he was seen carrying the briefcase on its side in

both arms, with

a 12"x16"x4"

light-colored package on top

of the briefcase.

Stewardess

then acted as a communica-

tions media between

the Unsub. and

the captain of the air-

craft until about five minutes after the aircraft depanted

the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when she was

instruct-

ed to go to the cockpit by the Unsub.

The hijacker's instructions after receiving

the money were vague. He probably wanted to jump from the

aircraft as soon as possible after the takeoff.

jacker put two of the parachutes, a back pack and

a front

pack, on prior to take

cal after the stairs were lowered in flight.

was delayed from jumping by the trouble he

experienced in

lowering the air

stairs and by the

fact he was not provided

a knapsack but rather a small white canvas bag which he had

to affix to her person utilizing parachute shroud lines from

an unused

parachute.

The plane departed Sea-Tac at 7:36 PM. Some four

or five minutes after take-off,

was sent to the

cockpit by the hijacker.

Some ten minutes arter she entered

the cockpit, one of the officers received a call on the

interphone

from the hijacker, advising he could not get

the air stairs down. The pilot then leveled off the aircraft

and reduced the air speed.

approximately five minutes later,. 18:05 FM), the officer

contacted the hijacker who said everything was okay. That was

the last communication with the hijacker.

CREES

Within a very short time, the

officer's panel showed that the stairs had been lowered

and

• At 8:11 PM, while the plane was

at 10,000 teet, the

crew experienced

a pressure bump or oscillation

and the Cabin

Pressure Rate of Change Gauge also reacted violently and it

was thought, at that time, that the hijacker might have left

the aircraft.'

When the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, a chest

pack chute and a back type chute were found on the plane.

The missing chest pack chute, sometimes referred to as an

emergency chute, is

a training pack "dummied up" to look

like a good one.

The missing back pack chute is non-steerable

and anyone utilizing this type chute would have no chance of

slowing down or picking his spot on which to land.

It is apparent from the following, excerpts, taken

from logs maintained by ground personnel on November 24,

1971, that the hijacker exited the airplane at 8:11 p.m.

local time.

when the hijacker jumped, the air stairs were

forced closed causing an increase in air pressure similar

to shutting a car door with the windows up.

As this pressure

increase occurred the co-pilot turned to look at the cabin

rate of clinb meter and in doing so his communications ear

plug was pulled from his ear.

The co-pilot's comments at this time were being

recorded on a tape recorder which had previously been started

on a time standard signal. Throuph careful play back and

sequencing,

the time of the pressure oscillation caused by

the air stairs closing after Unsub

departed was determined

to be 8:11 p.m. local time.

Ransom money in the amount of $200,000 was made

up entirely of used, random 20 dollar bills.

It was obtain-

ed from the Seattle first National Bank, Main Office, and

was part of a ransom package of $250,000. which had beer

maintained by the bank for such emergencies.

The package

measured approximately

one

foot by one foot by eight or

nine inches and weighed 19 pounds.

A check of the Federal Aviation Administration

flight section at Portland International Airport reflected

that on November 24, 2971 between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM,

there was a ceiling

of 5,000 feet, 3,500 feet broken clouds,

and at 1,500 feet scattered and broken clouds at times

with a wind of 12-14 knots.

The temperature at the end of

the air stairs at the time of the jump was approximately

00 c.

In October 5, 1972,

Nonthwest Orient Airlines, Minneapolis-Saint Paul Interna-

tional

Airport, advised he authorized a finers fee of

$25,000 total

reward or 15% for any portion of the ranson

money that is returned.

In addition, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, a

local newspaper in Seattle, has offered $5,000 for informa-

tion leading to the arrest and conviction of Unsub.

on 1/6/72, the NIA 727 which was actually involved .

in the hijacking, was flown to Seattle, by

for the purpose of conducting a test

to see if the "pressure

bump" experienced during the hijacking, was caused by some-

thing leaving the aircraft.

The conclusion

from that test was that the cabin

pressure change occurred when the stairs vere forced upward

by the air pressure after the weight had been removed.

according to

who was a member of

the hijacked

crew, and also a member of the crew when

the test was performed,

the occurrence was identical with

the incident on the night of the hijack. Also the

instrument in the cabin

which reacted so violently on

the

night of the hijacking, also reacted the same way when

the test was performed.

based on the test flight above,

then prepared a memo showing the stops. by which he arrived

at the best probable bail out point of the hijacker, and

plotted this area on a map. This information is set forth

On December 1, 1971, a fixed wing aircraft from

Woodland, Washington, was aloft and covered an area during

a slight period of clear

weather which encompassed the area

Iron Woodland, Washington, north to Silver Lake in Cowlitz

County, a distance of 10 miles and a section 10 miles on "

either

side of the flight path

of the hijacked aircraft.

Thile this was being conducted, Agents in ground units were

conducting door to door canvass

in-the vicinity of the

southerly end of Cowlitz County.

Total area covered by

air was 800 square miles with negative results.

On December 2, 1971, ten Agents walked in a defined

search pattern the area

in the immediate vicinity of the

circle of search as set forth

by Northwest Airlines. The

terrain was found to be composed of fields which are being

farmed and a number of impenetrable thickets which have

fallen logs, hidden beaver ponds, and creeks

and generally

hazardous and most difficult terrain to search on foot.

It was noted that in getting into the thicket and under-

brush growth, it was so heavy that even it an item was

live yards from the observer, it could easily be missed

due to overgrowth problems.

The area covered in this

physical terrain search was 1'1/2 miles long and 2/3 of

a mile wide and took approximately five hours. Negative

results in the search.

FIRST TERRAIN SEARCH

The purpose of the first terrain search was to

search for possible evidence left behind by Unsub and to

find the remains of Unsub assuming he made an unsuccessful

first terrain search commenced at 2:00 PM on

Manch 21, 1872 with 218 Army troops including officars,

20 Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and 9 helicopters.

The area to be searched covered approxi-

mately 25 square miles.

Due to snowfall in search area on March 25, 1972,

the search was temporarily held up. Army troops remained

on location and the search resumed at 12:00 Noon on

March 26, 1972.

The search was temporarily discontinued

at 12:00 Noon March 30, 1972 to allow search personnel to

rest and enjoy the. Easter Holiday..

The Army search equip-

ment was retained at search headquarters at Merwin Park.

The search recommenced 7:15:AM, April 8, 1972,

with 265 Army personnel and 20 Agents: .

snow, sleet and

freezing rain hampered search on April 12; 1972. Remaining

areas to be searched were reached only by helicopter in-

sertion of search personnel and landing zones in most

cases were under 6 to 12 inches of snow.

The search of the entire area was completed at

1:00 PM, April 17, 1972 with nothing found.

HUNTERS SEARCH

Prior to the 1972 hunting season, the following

information was made available to Washington State Game

Wardens who

supervise the area into which the hijacker

parachuted:

"On, November 24, 1971, a man parachuted into the

below-described area with

all received expeditious and thorough attention but all

SECOND TERRAIN SEARCH

In attempt to determine the accuracy of the first

search area, the following was learned:

The first search area was

calculated using a

system of plotting known as "GEOREF" (i.e. Geographical

Reference) which has a

plotting error of plus or minus

mile. A new plotting system using a computer generated

latitude

and longitude has a plotting ernor of plus or

minus 1/2 mile.

sing the new system

Vorthwest Orient Airlines

plotted a new course for

the NORJAK airplane and a new search area based on the new

course. The new

search area based on the new course.

The

new search area is partially outside the first area. (See

maps.)

;

It is felt that if Unsub's parachute opened, he

is no longer in the

southwest Washington area, but if his

parachute did not open he would be in a cornidor along

the flight path:

The time of jump is known, and an area

approximately one mile by seven miles represents the area

Unsub would have landed in if his parachute did not open.

Because some of the above corridor fell in the

old or first terrain search area, only an area 2 miles by

1/2 mile was searched during the second terrain search.

The second terrain search commenced March 12,

1973, and involved 10 Special Agents of the Seattle Office.

It was temporarily interrupted on March 16 and resumed again

March 26; 1973.

The, second terrain

search was completed March 29,

1973 with nothing found.

In an effort to show Unsub's swarthy complexion

and age more clearly, a new

color sketch has been prepared

and disseminated to all field offices.

FAA RECORDS

The Seattle Division advised the Bureau by Nitel

on June 8, 1972 of the following information concerning

the Federal Aviation Administration records for licensed

pilots:

In considering the feasability of checking FAA

records for all licensed pilots, the Oklahoma City Office

has advised that FAA Aeronautical Center maintains records

of over 850,000 licensed pilots.

These records are filed

by name or license, certificate number, but not by age.

further, they do not include photographs of each licensed

pilot.

The FAA at Oklahoma City advises that records are

permanently maintained at FAA on those pilots whose licenses

have been revoked, expired or lapsed.

FIRST SKYJACKING UTILIZING PARACHUTES

In an effort to determine the origin of the

conducted of the magazine and

The below quoted newspaper article described the

first known skyjacking in which a parachute was used by

the skyjacker.

The Seattle Times, November 13, 1971:

"Calgary, Alberta - (UPI) - A masked hyjacker

carrying more than

40 pounds of dynamite was knocked un-

conscious today by. an Air Canada crewman wielding a fire ax.

The crewman's action 3,000 feet in. the air ended a six-

hour hijacking which skipped back

and forth over the United

States - Canadian, border.

"The hijacker, reported in fair condition today

with a possible skull fracture, was putting on a parachute

to bail out of the Des over calgary when he was struck by

the ax.

"The hijacker, carrying a shotgun in addition to

the dynamite, took control last night of the Calgary to

Montreal flight carrying 123 persons. Claiming to be a member

of the Irish Republican Army, the man demanded $1.5 million

and a free passage to Ireland. (A touring I.R.A. spokesman

denied that the hijacker belonged to the I.R.A.)

"After landing in Great Falls, Montana, the man

accepted $50,000 ranson.

The plane took off, landed again

at Great-falls, and the

man let the passengers to unharmed.

But, he

ordered the plane with its five-member crew to take

off

again.

Indecision on the part of the hijacker led

the plane back'and forth across the border before he ap-.

parently decided to jump.

"Flight 812 made its first landing at Great Falls

after the hijacker had taken over 40 miles west of Winnipeg,

Manitoba.

There it was refueled and the $50,000 was handed

to the hijacker by a policewonan.

The money

was raised

by bankers as the plane circled the city for two hours.

"The plane then took off for a scheduled stop in

Regina, Saskatchewan, to let the 114 passengers aboard

disembark.

The plane did not land in

Regina, however, but

turned back and set down in Great Falls again where the

passengers and three of the nine crew members were set free.

"On its second take-off. from Great Falls, Air

Canada officials said the hijacker wanted to be taken to

New York City before proceeding to Ireland.

The man, des-

cribed as 5-feet-), dark-haired and in his 30's then

decided he wanted to go to Phoenix, Arizona, but finally

settled for Calgary.

"At Great Falls Airport, Gov. FORREST ANDERSON

and hundreds of onlookers stood by. ANDERSON said he came

to persuade the hijacker to surrender or at least release

the passengers.

He never saw the hijacker, however, "

_ SR-71 Flights

from Beale Air Force Base advised each such flight requires

minimum of one week advance clearance with FAA due to sonic

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of

them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly contained

is believed Unsub' threw this athe enerous other

items he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to jumping,

it would fall almost

directly in the path of the aircraft.

Ine 127 air stairs were lowered sometime after 7:42 p.m. and

Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24, 1971.

The

plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles durine

this time.

The items

could possibly be lodged in thickly wooded,

area would cover a strip of

land approximately 87 miles long by one-half mile wide.

It

has been suggested that infrared photography might possibly

indicate non-living material, such as an attache case, in a

darker shade than living material, thereby enabling the case

to be found using infrared high resolution photography.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. The

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or any

other time. is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the area

covered is relatively small when compared to the entire

flight path.

with infrared imagery, that efforts to locate the attache case

by this means would probably prove futile.

The terrain, as

described, would neutralize any effort, particularly if tala i

Further explained

was the necessity for the preserice of heat which would neer

The size of the attache case provides a poor

All three individuals interviewed continued to

the aerial photography procedures in this particular instance.

The Alexandria Division was requested to determine

the feasibility of routing a visual aerial photography training

To Whom It May Concern:

A few months ago I saw a composite drawing

in the Bress telegram of a suspect in the ransoming

and highjacking of an airliner from the Washington

state area. He subseauently bailed out with the

money and was never found.

The striking resemblance of your drawing

to a fellow that I worked with in the 1950-52

years has been bothering me because of his age,

size and background. My suspicions are merely that

and are not based on any facts at my disposal at

this time. I feel his character, background,

mode of living, make him a likely suspect.

His name is Owen Reypnolds: and is a

He survived three seperate air crashes and

after the war was called back to the active reserve

discussed

rewards offered in this case. He told me of rewards having been

offered of 10% of recovered amounts, or possibly $25,000 if all

is recovered.

also told me of a Seattle newspaper

offering $5000.

Photos of the captioned individual were previously

He is described by

associates as a blond headed, blue eyed, light to medium

complexioned, Caucasian male and not Latin in appearance.

Rased on the above, it would not appear he should be

considered as a

likely suspect,

however, in view of his highly

misual activities and the

results of recent extensive invest

warranted to postively eliminate him as a suspect in this
