If passenger

lists of flights Iron Portland to Seattle for

MONTHLY SUMMARY

Re: Seattle airtel to the Bureau, 2/7/73.

SEARCH AREA AND COURSE

In attempt to determine the accuracy of the first

search area, the following was learned:

The first search area

was calculated using a system

of plotting nown as

"GIOREF" (i.e. Geographical Reference)

which has a plotting error of plus or minus one mile.

A new

plotting systen using a computer generated latitude and longi-

tude has a plottina error of plus or minus 1/2 nile.

Using

the new systar,

Is Northwest Orient Airlines

plotted & new course for the Morjak airplane and a new search

area based on the new course. The now search area is partially

outside the first area.

It is folt that if Unsub's parachute opened, he is

no longer in the southwest Washington area, but if lis parachute

did not open, he would be in a corridor along the flight path.

the time of junp is known, and an area approximately one mile

by seven miles reprasents the area Unsub. would have landed in

if his parachute did not open.

Seattle Division is currently naking arrangerents to

seurch that portion of the above described area not previously

searched.

WEEKLY SUMMARY

As the result of the Seattle file review

currently in progress, the following investigation has

been initiated:

On the premise that unsub parachuted

successfully into the previously calculated area of

southwest washington, it is spectulated he would have

buried the noney and his parachute and then hiked to

the marest road or highway. Fron there, he would most

probably have walked to the nearest phone booth and

called a friend or relative for the purpose of being

picked up.

Based on the above, all the pay phones

surrounding the calculated drop area within reasonable

walking distance, 1.e., 15 miles, are being checked for

long distance phone calls made during the evening of

11/24/71 and on the morning of 11/25/71.

ReSEairtel to Bureau dated 8/22/72, requesting

mats of the artist's conception prepared in captioned matter

for use in obtaining more widespread publicity:

In accordance with the request of the Seattle

Office 8/7/12, a color artist's conception was preparec

and forwarded

to the Seattle Office.

To date the Bureau

has received no evaluation of this color sketch. Seattle's

request for mats will not be further considered until the

Bureau receives an evaluation by the witnesses of the

color sketch.

For the information of the Seattle Office,

commercial engravers charge $10 per 50 minutes plus

initial charge of $8 for a 4" x 5" plate.

These mats will

only reproduce in black and white. Many publishers both

large and small presently use the offset printing process

which does not require a mat.

the seattle VIIice should promptly coordinate

review of the Bureau's color sketch for the purpose of

evaluation. If it is deemed advisable that the mats

be prepared, resubmit your recommendation.

Reference Seattle airtel to the Bureau

In order that this case be given more publicity,

the following leads are being set forth for Bureau

consideration and approval:

1. Mats should be made of the artist's conception

of Unsub so that small publications with limited

funds can feature articles concerning this matter

:

and include with the story a picture of Unsub

without incurring the additonal expense of having

new mats made (Note: - An editor of the Veterans'

of Foreign Wars publication for the State of

Oregon has requested such a mat to print a

picture of Unsub in his next issue).

2.

If the artist's conception of Unsub is changed

as suggested in referenced airtel, mats of the

new picture should also be made.

SUBJECT :

DRIAK

Re Bureau airtel 5/17/72.

Pursuant to instructions contained in referenced

airtol, an extensive file review of captioned case was con-

ducted.

Among the files reviowed were the main volumes,

nunbered 1 through 47, sub-files designated for particular

areas of interest, 1.e., Parachutes, Mitnesses, Couror, 1-A

volimes and numorous suspect files.

In addition, an examina-

tion was made of all physical evidence being maintainod at

seattle,. for pertinent investigative leads.

As a result of this review, the following suggestions

are being proposed:

REWARD:

This case has generated vorld-wide attentir and

many suspects have boen suggested and are continuing

to be reccived. Horever, since nothing of value has yet been

developca, it is felt that the prospect of a sunstantial

reward for information leading to the identification and

conviction of this hijacker, might entice someone to come

forward and nane the hijacker.

To be rcalistic, the roward would have to be

attractive to the person furnishing the information and

therefore, a sum of not less than $25,000 is reconmended.

The reward money could be provided either by the

Department of Justicc, or by the airlines, or by boch. The

only roward at the moment is $5,000, offered by the seattle,

SCHUTZ requested that I be sure to get word to you

that he expects to hear from you tonight to talk over the

search situation.

He also advised it will be

necessary to get a

"good" teletype off to the Bureau tonight relative to the

discontinuance of the search for the time being.

this tele

type should generally point out that the arny has withdrawn

troops, that the search has veen arduous and physically

exhausting and that the troops are being withdrawn primarily

to give them some rest; also in view of the approaching

holiday weekend.

It should point out that agents have been

with the troops

throughout the scarch and that the agents

involved also have undergone an arduous and tiring experience

and can use rest too. It should point out that UACB

They will

He advised that the photograph when devebped will be

Re: UNKNOWN SUBJECT, aka Dan Cooper;

NORTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT #305,

PORTLAND TO SEATTLE,

11/24/71

CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT - HIJACKING;

EXTORTION

On November 24, 1971, an unknown man using the

name Dan Cooper, boarded Northwest Airlines Flight E305,

at Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon, en-

route Seattle, Washington.

As the plane was taxiing down the runway,

Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved

for the stewardesses on the right side of the plane and

behind the last row of passenger seats. The unknown

subject, who occupied the center seat in the last row of

three seats, turned and handed her an envelope which she

did not open for a few minutes until he glanced at her

several times.

She then opened

the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said: "Miss.- I have a bomb here

and I would like you to sit by me."

At this point Stewardess

came toward the rea

of the plane and

handed the note.

then called the

pilot on

the intercom.

on the

flight, later advised that according to notes he made

during the incident, the emergency signal from Stewardess

was received on the intercom at 3:59 PM.

Stewardess

then sat next to the hijacker

who opened a black attache case and showed her what he said

i scrame chee

was a bomb. She described the contents of the attache case

as a bundle of red sticks, which she believed was dynamite.

The bundle consisted of six or eight rea

colored sticks

approximately six to eight inches long with no writing on the

outside.

The hijacker was holding in his hand a wire which

led to the bundle of sticks and indicated that he could

detonate the bomb by touching the wire to a contact. Also in

the attache case was a cylindrical shaped battery about eight

inches long.

following

to say:

1.

The Director approved publicity of the

article and artist's conception in the parachute magazine

in response to our teletype 12/7/71.

2. He referred to a teletype of 12/ /71 from

Portland in regard to a person who was

•. He said it seemed to him

that Portland had set out a lot of unnecessary

investigation since the purpose of the thing was simply

to get a photo of the suspect and have it shown to

witnesses rather than getting all the background.

3. He wanted to know if we had considered

having a Northwest plane fly Agents over the exact course at

night so that we could look down and see just what the

situation was when the "bump" occurred at 8:10 or 8:12 PM.

I told him we had considered this and also had considered

hiring someone to parachute from the plane but the problem

was that there was no way of duplicating the conditions

which existed at the time. He requested we put some type

of language in a teletype about enis.

SEATTLE HAS CONDUCTED AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF WHAT WAS

CONSIDERED THE PRIME AREA INTO WHICH THE SUBJECT MIGHT HAVE

PARACHUTED, ALL WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. THIS AREA WAS CONSIDERED

PRIME DUE TO CALCULATIONS BY NORTHWEST AIRLINES OF THEIR FLIGHT

RECORDER AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS ABOARD THE PLANE PLUS THE

EXPERIENCING OF AN QUOTE OSCILLATION UNQUOTE BY PILOT.

NORTHWEST AIRLINES HAS OFFERED TO SIMULATE THE SAME

CONDITIONS OF THE AIRCRAFT AS PREVAILED DURING THE HIJACK AND

WILL FLY OVER THE SAME COURSE FROM SEATTLE TO RENO. THEY ARE

ANXIOUS TO DETERMINE IF THE CONCLUSIONS THEY HAVE REACHED ARE,

IN FACT, CORRECT AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DETERMINE THIS IS TO

HAVE A RERUN OF THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS.

SEATTLE WILL ARRANGE, THROUGH THE MINNEAPOLIS OFFICE, FOR

NORTHWEST TO DO THIS AT SUCH TIME AS NORTHWEST CAN DO SO.

BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED FLIGHT,

SEATTLE WILL MAKE A JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL

Reference Seattle letter to Minneapolis dated

5/23/79.

Enclosed for Seattle are the original and two

copies of an FD-302 reflecting interview withI

of Northwest Orient Airlines and an

airplane decal which was enclosed in referenced letter

for Minneapolis.

On 7/19/79,

advised that

the probability that this decal came from the same aircraft

hijacked by COOPER is about ninety-nine per cent.

He noted

that there is a slight difference in the color of the

lettering of the decals placed on the aircraft and that

recovered. This, of course, could be accounted for by the

weather conditions.

The second thing noted by l

is that the decal

does not appear to be as worn as one

would think after having been located in the out state

area for the past eight years. He thought that a decal in

this condition would have been handled by preditors more

than it appears.

suggested that perhaps the

Bureau could contact the manufacturer of the decal in order

to determine if the decal could withstand the weathering

conditions and still be in this condition.

He heard on the news that a plastic decal, possibly

This item he saw in the tree was light in

SUMMARY

This report presents the results of tents conducted on the Model 727

airplane to evaluate the characteristics of the aft airstair when

extended inflight and the associated effects on airplane performance

and handling.

The airstair was extended both by allowing it to free

fall and by utilizing normal bydraulic power.

tase extensiong were.

made with the airplane triumed for level flight at 125 knots and flaps

at 25 degrees.

The sirstsir extended a nominal 8.5 degrees when allowed

to free-fall and it required only approximately one-tenth unit of

nose-dow trim to compensate lor the stair. The stair extended a

nominal 13.5 degrees with hydraulic power and this caused approxi

mately & three-tenchs unit nose down trim change.

The airplane was

also accelerated to no with flaps up and the airstair free-floating.

The sirstair was quite stable when it was down and no sirplane control

problems were experienced.

No excessive cabin pressure trensients

were noted with the aft entry door open and the stair extended. The

environment near the aft entry door allowed it to be safely opened

and the stair retracted at speeds up to 300 knots. At 300 knoüa, 1t

was also round that the airstair would not free-fall when unlatched.

INTRODUCITON

Reference (a) specified that the aît airstairs should be released in flight

and alloved to free-fall without utilizing hydraulic power, simulating an

in-flight failure of the airstain up-latch.

In addition, it also specified

thai the sirstair should be extended by utilizing normal hydraulic power.

The aerodynamic characteristics of the extended airstair and the associated

effects on airplane performance and handling were also to be evaluated

speeds up to vio

The initial evaluation was conducted on Test 100-l, with most of the produc

tion airstair cavity panels removed. They were removed to avoid the possi

bility of panel lailure causing damage to wiring and tubing in the area, in

the event large pressure differentials should occur.

Testing was done with

flaps at 25 degrees and a nominal airspeed of 125 knots, with the airstair

allowed to free-fall and also extended with hydraulic power. In addition,

with the aft airstair free-floating, the flaps were retracted and the air-

plane was accelerated to Vro®

The testing was repeated 'on Test 100-3 with

all the production airstair cavity ponels installed, with the exception

that no hydraulic airstair extension was attempted.

In addition, two un

successiul attempts were made to release the airstair and allow it to free-

fall at an approximate airspeed of 300 knots.

Both tests were conducted from Boeing Field. Seattle, on Airplane N72700.

Boeing pilots, Mr. J. WaddelD and Mr. S. I. Wallick, conducted Test 100-1,

with Boeing Test Engineer, Mrc. R. F. Browe, operating the aft airstair.

Test 100-3 was conducted by Boeing pilots, Mr. J. Waddell and

with Boeing lest Ingineer, Mr. C. M. Clark, operating the airstair.

I DECEASED

CONFIGURATION

Model 727-22, Airplane N72700, was in production configuration as detailed

In Reference (b) except for the removal of the production airstair cavity

panels during Test 100-1 and the removal of the airstair spring-loaded latch

stop during both tests.

In addition, FC 751-1-1 was incorporated on the

airplane for both tests. This FC provided a cable to restrain the airstair

to a maximum extension of 25 degrees and thus prevent airstair damage duriag

Ianding in the event the stair could not be retracted in flight.

The airplane cabin was depressurized during both tests, with the ram air

valve closed, both air conditioning packs off, and the manual pressure con-

troller in full decrease pressure.

INSTRUMINTATION AND DAIA REDUCTION

A Pulse Duration Modulation (PDM) magnetic tape system and a photorecorder

were used to record performance and calibrated data. Airspeed and altitude

were measured using the pilots' production pitot-static system. The sit

airstair was instrumented to measure position in degrees from the up and

The static pressure in Section 48 was measured by a pick-up

that was located on the Il side of the airplane, outboard of the Ill cavity

side panels. Airplane cabin pressure and rate of climb vere recorded on the

(Pages 13 through 23).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The aft airstair control system was in production configuration for both

Test 100-1 and 100-3, except for removal of the spring-loaded latch stop.

The latch stop was removed to permit moving the control handle to the UP

position with the airstair down, thus simulating a condition which could

exist 1f the up latch failed inflight.

With the airstair down and the

control handle in the UP posicion, boch the UP and DOWN side of the stair

actuator are connected to the system return line through the control valve,

allowing the airstair to free-float. The control handle was in the

UP

position during all test conditions, except for stair extension and

retraction and the stair extension utilizing hydraulic power.

The sequence during Test 100-1 (Reference (a)) started with the airplane

crimmed for level flight at 10,000 feet altitude and 125 knots airspeed,

flaps at 35 degrees, cabin depressurized, and the airstair up and locked.

With the operator wearing a parachute and secured by a restraining stra,

the alt entry door was opened. No difficulty was experienced in opening

the aft entry door and the operator then moved the upper control handle to

the DOWN position without depressing the handle trigger.

Thus, the air-

stair was unlocked and allowed to free-fall. After the stair started to

the control handle was moved to the UP position and the stair was

allowed to iree-float. No noticeable out rush or cabin air Has experienced

when the stair extended and only a one-tenth unit nose-down trim change was

required to counteract the airstair floating down approximately 8.5 degrees.

The alt entry door was allowed to remain open and & photograph of tuft

activity was taken after the airplane stabilized on this condition (Page 7 ).

Ibe tuit pleture appears to indicate some airflow into the cabin.

With the flaps still at 25 degrees and at approximately-125 knots airspeed,

the airstair was successfully retracted and the uplatch secured by moving

the control handle from the UP to the RETRACT position, depressing the

handle trigger, and moving the hanale back to the UP position after the

sirstair was fully retracted. The next condition involved extending the

stair utilizing hydraulic power.

The control handle was moved from the UP

to the DOWN position with the handle trigger depressed. With hydraulic

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION (Continued)

pressure on the Down side of the actuator, the airstair initially

extended to approximately 14 degrees and then retracted slightly,

probably because of compression of the lower struts.

Three-tenths

of a unit nose down trin change was required with the airetair in this

position, but no control problens were experienced (Reference tabulation

on Page 10) the aft entry door Has open throughout this condition and

another picture of tuit activity was taken (Page 8). Inis picture is

not as clear as the first because the flash bulb failed to operate.

Following this, the control handle was returned to the UF position,

allowing the airstair to free-float, and the alt entry door as closea.

The flaps were then retracted to zero and the airplane retrimmed at

approximately 200 knots airspeed and 10, 000 feet altitude. Angine power

was then increased to MCT and the airplane was accelerated to no, re

trinming each time the stick force reached approximately 20 to 30 pounds.

The free-floating stair oscillated a maximum of 1.5 degrees during the

acceleration, but no extreme bouncing was observed (Reference plot on

Page //). No control problems were experienced during the acceleration,

and the airstair slouly retracted as the airspeed increased. Another

picture of tuit

activity at luo was taken through the alt entry door

sindow (Page 9 ). Although the field of view is quite restricted,

again the tuits appear to indicate some sirfion into the cavity. Tais

inflow of air was also noticed when the aft entry door was unlatched

at ino and some inflow of air was noted around the door seals.

the

door was again latched and the airplane decclerated to approximately

260 knots airspeed, at which time the at entry door as easily openea,

the aft airstair was again successfully retracted and latched, and the

entry door closed.

the airstair was not extended using hydraulic pressure. In adcition,

Vo, making it easier to hold a nearly constant altitude (Reference plot

on Page 12). An additional condition was also conducted during this

test: namely, two attempts were made to unlock the airstair and allow

It to free-fall at an airspeed of approximately 300 knote. This condition:

was done after accelerating to luo with the stair down.

The aft entry

door was easily opened at this airspeed, again noting a slight inflow of

air into the cabin.

The airstair was successfully retracted with bydraulic

power and the control handle moved to the UP position to lock the stair.

Following this, the handle was moved to the DOWN position, without

depressing the handle trigger, to permit the stair to free-fall. Although

the uplock was visually observed to rotate and release the stair and the

pilot reported that the warning light in the control cabin indicated the

stair vas unlocked, the air load prevented the stair from extending.

second attempt was made at this sirspeed, after first returning the

control handle to the UP position and then positioning It to dowl.

The

same results vere obteined. The test was concluded by again closing and

RESULAS AND DISCUSSION (Continued)

latching the ait entry door at the airspeed of approsimately 300 knots.

No, further pictures of tuft activity were taken on this test.

Since

no large pressure surges had been recorded in the cavity during Test

100-1, all of the production sirstair cavity panels vere installed

during Test 100-3. No penel movement or o1l-canning was noticed during

the test, and no panel Lailures were noted aiter landing.

CONCLUSIONS

No unusual control or handling problems should be experienced 1f the

aft airsiair should accidentally exiend inflight. In fact, from the

resulis obtained during Test 100-3, 11 the up-latch failed at normal

cruise speed, the ait airsiair would probably not extend until the airplane

slowed down to some airspeed below 300 knota. Ine control handle would be

:

& positive stop. thus, the first indication of latch fallure would occur

when the airstair extended far enough to operate the stair warning ligat

microswitch located st the aft end of the cavity. Since the sirstair

might contact the runway as the airspeed decreased aiter landing, the

aft entry door could be opened and an operator could safety initiate

stair retraction. Provided there was no structural Interference iron

a failed roller or up-latch, the airstair should retract. However, it

would be necessary to hold the control handle in the REtRACt position

and keep the trigger depreused, lecause the system is depressurized when

the control handle is in the UP position.

FD-302 (REV. 11-27-70)

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

"Dole of transcription November 30, 1971

S? LEWIS FALLICK, a Test Pilot employed by The

Boeing Company, Seattle; Washington, telephone 655-4031,

furnished the following information:

He was the Chief Test Pilot on the Boeing 727

project and he conducted the flight testing of this aircraft.

On several occasions during this testing he

intentionally lowered the rear stairs under the tail of the

aircraft while in flight: The effect of lowering these stairs

in flight was hardly noticeable on the controls and the only

positive indication he had that the stairs were lowered was -

the lighting of an indicator light on the instrument panel.

The stairs were lowered at a speed of 150 knots. While the

stairs were lowered the plane remained in the same attitude.

there was no yawing or pitching:

He furnished the following opinions in connection

with the question of whether or not a pilot would feel in his

controls a sudden loss of weight of approximately 180 pounds

from the tail of a 727. He advised that if the pilot were

flying the aircraft manually and if the air were calm, he would

feel a sudden loss of 180 pounds weight from the tail of the

It 1s doubtiul that the pilot would feel this sudden loss of

He advised that if the rear stairs on a 727 is

lowered in flight at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet a

change in pressurization occurs and this could be felt by the

crew if the door leading into the cockpit is open. If the

cockpit door were closed, it is doubtful that the crew would

experience the

EARI J. COSSEY, 349 North 10lst, Seattle, telephone

SU3-0475, appeared at the Seattle Office

furnished the following information:

He is a master parachute rigger and jump instructor

at Seattle Sky Sports, Issaguah, Washington, telephone

EX2-3050.

In May, 1971

and needed

two parachutes.

COSSEY

packed two parachutes which were furnished to

oI about May , 1971.

He described

these parachutes as

back packs, commonly referred to as "emergency" parachutes.

He also packed the two chest pack parachutes which were

furnished to Northwest Airlines on November 24, 1971.

b6

b7C

The two parachutes recovered from the Northwest

Airlines flight 305 at Reno, Nevada, on November 24, 1971,

were described in detail to Mr. COSSEY at which time he

described

the missing back pack parachute as having a sage

green nylon container, model NB6 (Navy Back pack 6) with

sage, green nylon harness, which harness has no "D" rings

to mount a chest pack.

The parachute is a 28 foot nylon

white flat circular with a specially fitted foam padded

cushion.

The pilot chute is also white.

MI. COSSEY said that the missing chest pack para-

chute is a ground training pack dummied uy

to look like a

good one. He said that by

"dummied up" he means that tie

downs were attached to the container.

This chest pack

was devised by COSSEY to teach trainees while hung in a

harness how to open the chest pack in the event of an

emergency•

The folds of the parachute are sewen together

to preclude the parachute opening in the training room.

Mr. COSSEY said that the back packs furnished the hijacker

did not have the necessary hooks on the harness to attach

a chest pack.

MI. COSSEY said that if the hijacker opened one

of the chest packs on the airplane he probably would

remove the parachute and put the money in the chest pack

as it would be impossible to hold anything in his hand

when the parachute opened.

MI. COSSEY said it would

be quite possible to parachute from a 727 jet if the jet

was below 10,000 feet and flying at a very slow rate of

speed.

The person jumping from the plane would have to

free fall to earth for several thousand feet to slow

himself down and get himself in position for the back

pack to open. Even an experienced parachutist would

experience considerable shock from the chute opening,

however, this would cause little or no personal injury.

He said

that anyone who had six or seven practice jumps

could accomplish this as the first five jumps would be

on a static line and the subsequent jumps would be free

fall.

He said that jumping at night materially increases

the chance of injury and in this case he would consider

the parachutists

MI. COSSEY said the back pack used by the hijacker is

non-steerable and he would have no chance of slowing down

or picking the spot on which to land. Also at night he

would be unable to gauge his distance to the ground which

would result in a much harder impact.

It was his opinion

the skyjacker would suffer severe ankle and or leg injuries

from this jump.

Mr. COSSEY said that the fact the hijacker wore

street shoes would also increase the chance that he would

be injured on landing as the most experienced jumpers

wear jump boots or some rigid ankle support.

Mr. COSSEY expressed the opinion that the pilot

of the jet would notice

some oscillation when the hijacker

departed the rear of the aircraft.

Seattle, Washington, provided the

upon being advised of the iden-

tity of the writer, handed the

writer a film canister contain-

ing a microfilm, upon which the serial numbers of $250,000

worth of notes were recorded. He advised that of the $250,000

worth of notes, the federal Bureau of Investigation should only

be concerned with the $20 bills, that is the serial numbers of

the $20 bills, because the hijacker received only $20 bills.

stated that there are $230,000 worth of $20 bills

recorded on the microfilm. L

Jadvised that in order

for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine the

serial numbers of the $20 bills which the hijacker actually

received, we must subtract serial numbers which he provided

me from the total list of serial numbers on the microfilm.

provided a list of serial numbers

of $20 totaling $30,000

worth of notes, which, although they

were on the microfilm itself, were not

part of the $200,000

worth of $20 bills which the hijacker received.

stated that the bank packs

$20 bills in packages of 1000

Each packet therefore contains $2,000 worth of $20 bills.

provided the first and last serial number in each

of these $20 bill packets and advised that we should subtract

both'of these numbers, as well as the 98 serials numbers

between each of these

groups of numbers in order to determine

the actual serial numbers of the bills which the hijacker

received.

These groups of numbers are as follows:

: L41197159A thru E12561828B

L33639577A thru L20458572A
