RE: Jack Coffelt, # 66674

Dear

X-ray examination of the chest reveals the previously described blunting of the left

costophrenic angle secondary to scarring.

Old healed rib fractures are noted on the

right. The lung fields are clear.

The heart is unremarkable. The aorta is elongated

calcified at the knob and tortuous. The lateral view reveals degenerative changes

of

the thoracic spine.

X-ray examination of the right shoulder girdle reveals no evidence of fracture of

subluxation. Minimal degenerative changes are noted.

dear

Several months ago you called me in Toledo, Ohio relative to

the "D.B. Cooper" skyjacking case.

matron on the incur entes tit was gave derstand ng trem infor

It was my understanding from your

conversation that you were soon to meet with Mr. Nyrop of

NiA and that you had, or expected to receive, MA's blessing

and cooperation on the film you intended to produce.

I indicated, based on the above, that I rould be interested,

pending further information, on helping you with the intended

project.

I have since learned that Northwest is not interested in the

project and are in fact very much opposed to it. On that basts

I could not participate in any way in the project and I further

request that you do not use any of the information I gave you

on the phone in connection with my name.

In view of Northwest's feeling about the project it could be

very difficult for me if you were to use my name in any way

in connection with furnishing of information or cooperating

with you on the project.

I am sorry the circumstances are such but know you will re-

spect my wishes.

against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice be-

fore we ask you any questions, and to have him with you during questioning.

You have this right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot

afford to hire one. We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be

appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court. If you wish to

answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop

answering questions at any time. You also have the right to stop answering

at any time until you talk to a lawyer.
