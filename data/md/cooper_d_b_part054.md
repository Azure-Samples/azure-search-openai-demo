$20 Bills Get Close

Look Here

For perhaps the first time,

most people in the Portland

area know whose picture is

on a $20 bill.

That's because they have

been checking serial num-

bers on bills in their posses-

sion against the list of serial

numbers being published in

The Journal-of the $20 bilis

extorted from Northwest On-

ent Airlines in the $200,000

: "D.B.

Cooper'

hijack

of

1971.

The

newspaper will pay

$1,000 for the

first of the

"Cooper cash" to be turned

in either to the newspaper or

to the FBI.

Publication of the

10,000

serial numbers began in last

Thursday's Journal and will

• be continued in installments

until the entire list is repro-

duced for the newspaper's

readers from the official FBI

list.

The fate of. the man who

bought a ticket at Portland

under the name "Dan Coop-

er" and then parachuted into

the night with money he ex-

torted from the airline is a

bafiling mystery. Not so baf-

the airline hijacker's where-

The word is out that the identity of the

finally been discovered: A CBS "60

Minutes" reporter was in town recently

interviewing witnesses to the 1970

skyjack and has got some positive

identifications. The story that bas leaked

out is that the mysterious Mr. Cooper was

a Northwest native who died a year or so

Shy divers help

ARIEL, Wash. (AP) - Sky divers plummeted into

an empty campground and souvenir sweatshirts sold

briskly as the people of Ariel celebrated the fifth

anniversary of sky-pirate Dan Cooper's mysterious

parachute jump.

The "Cooper Caper," as the weekend festivity was

dubbed, commemorated the skyjacking that gave

this town of 400 persons its biggest claim to fame.

• It was a stormy night - Nov. 24, 1971 - when the.

skyjacker who called himself Dan Cooper hijacked a

Northwest Airlines 727, collected $200,000 and bailed

out somewhere between Seattle and Reno.

Cooper never was found, Neither was the money.

Or such stuff legends are made.

One man in the Ariel bar, where Cooper, af

airplane door slam shut that night.

The yearly event in Ariel teles D.B. Cooper's 1971 disappearance

By Richard Spiro

The Daily News

ARIEL - Saturday will be Cooper's Caper

Days once more in this community, where hi-

jacker D.B. Cooper, burdened with $200,000,

might have jumped from the rear door of a

Boeing 727 on Nov. 24, 1971.

David R. Butterfield, publicity chairman for

this more or less prestigious event, plans to

whomp up 30 gallons of loggers' stew outdoors

near the Ariel Store and Tavern.

Rumors that he will not be allowed to prepare

the stew inside the store because the effluvium

would

dangerously weaken the rafters is

described by Butterfield as arrant nonsense.

There have been some changes since the

celebration was first thrust upon the helpless

populace. Dave and Laurel Fisher, one-time

Californians, now own the store. And instead of

buffalo stew, Butterfield has to make do with

loggers' stew becalise the buffalo have all gone

No one knows where Cooper has gone, but

there is more than a slight suspicion that he too

Is roaming that happy hunting ground, where

the $200,000 he extorted from Northwest Orient

Airlines will do him no good

Butterfield notes that the celebration this

year will be spiced up a bit because earlier a

sign from the rear door of a Boeing 727 was

found in the area. More recently an orange and

white parachute turned up in a wooded area of

the county. The FBI says it was not one used by

Cooper.

The only hard and fast facts, however, are

that neither Cooper — if indeed that is his name

- nor the money has ever been found.

Meanwhile, back at the Ariel Store the pot.

Legend of ahjacker comes.ia

Cricket Theater

By Mlke Steele

Staff Writer.

- 16.

On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, a mild-

mannered man using the name D.B..

Cooper hijacked a Northwest Air-

lines 727 and, somewhere south of

Seattle, parachuted. out clutching

$200,000 in $20 bills. He hasn't been

seen since.

It was a great mystery and Cooper

became something-of a folk hero.

Songs were-written about his daz-

zling escapade and D.B. Cooper took

his piace alongside Robin Hood

"17 morths to-live." He

took the money, he wrote,

"to gain a

few last grains of peace of mind."

One who didn't overlook the letter

was playwright John Orlock. "I was

fascinated by that letter," explained

the 33-year-old writer, "especially a

worked well enough that the Cricket

is presenting it on its main stage be-

Lou Salernt's direction.

The play, like most of Orlock's to

date, will be a comic drama. It won't

be the big, metaphorical statement

i he'll be after but, as he put it,

"just

"I'm of the opinion that this type of

thing doesn't need to be perpetuated.

Cooper represented no ideals and no

values. He's not a folk hero. He was

a man acting selfishly. The number

of people who can be harmed by

men who think. they'll be immortal-

ized is innumerable."

In 1971, Hubbard wrote a book

called "The Skyjacker." It's the only

psychiatric study of the "skyjacking

personality," and it's based

on doz.

ens of interviews with men who com-

mitted the crime.

Hubbard's premise is that we are

bound together by twofold gravity.

One pari is physical--which holds us

ro carth. Another is emotional-

which noids us to each other. Sky

lacking, he concludes, is a defiance

also believes in "muta-

tions." One man commits the crime:

another emulates

it. Cooper—he

points out--was not the first to get io-

gether parachutes,

bombs and dis-

guises. A Canadian tried the same

trick in Calgary three wecks before.

Hubbard assumes Cooper read about

it and tried to go the Canadian one

Rackstraw, 35, was questioned about the skyjacking

The discovery of explosives early last year in a

Stochton warehouse leased by Rackstraw, plus his back-

ground as a pilot and his extensive military parachute

training, led to his being questioned in connection with

Great Party,

D.B. Cooper

D.B. Cooper missed the party in his honor at the

Ariel Tavern in Lewis County last night on the seventh

anniversary of his $200,000 jump irom the rear exit of a

Boeing 727. Apparently.

"We're not sure,

"We kind of expected he might show up this year,"

be said. "Of course, if I were him, I wouldn't have come.

This is the year the statute of limitations on the skyjack-

Cooper hasn't been seen or heard from since some-

one giving that name parachuted from the plane on

Thanksgiving eve in 1971. It remains the country's only

unsolved airplane hijacking.

"We did have a D.B. Cooper arrive at the party,"

Tricola said. "He said he was 'dead on arrival.' But then

the party started about noon.

"At least it was already going when I got up at noon.

We're having a lot of fun. The place is jammed. There

must be 500 to 1,000 people in here," he said.

Tricola said they had planned to serve buffalo stew

but couldn't get any buffalo.

Four parachutists had planned to land right in front

of the tavern yesterday, but fog forced them to jump a

Anyway, her husband added, "it's a nice break in the

winter and we have an awful lot of fun."

And if he or any accomplices have

There is no statute of limitations fori

them - ever, says Ralph Himmelsbach,

veteran FBI agent who has lived withi

the Cooper case for the past five years,

literally day and night.

"We are continuing our investiga-

tion unabated," said Himmelsbach. "We

don't intend to give up. I still give al

•Dan Cooper. We have no more informa:

tion on his identity today than we had

five years ago."

The FBI bases its rejection of the

statute of limitations on three major

assumptions: There is no statute of limi-

tations in capital crimes and air piracy:

¿able by death in November 1971 and

passengers and crew of six could be

clusion that Cooper was killed when he

crime. If he had any accomplices, which

- is not indicated by any evidence so far,

they would be equally guilty:"

To back up his conclusions, Him-

melsbach for the first time, told the

detailed story of the hijacking:

"Cooper was given four

chutes," Himmelsbach said. "He cut the

shroud lines on one of the best para

chutes and used them to tie the 10.000

$20 bills to his belt in a bag before he

bailed out.

"He left behind the two best para-

chutes - a sky diver parachute withja

32-foot canopy and a chest pack de-

signed primarily for use as a second

parachute.

"He wore a pilot's seat pack parai

ichute with a 28-foot canopy. He als

took with him a chest pack parachute

jused for training. It was unusable. The

panels were sewn together. If it had

been usable he could not have attached

it to his parachute harness, which had

no D rings for use with a chest pack, No

one who knew anything about para-

chutes would have made this many mis-

takes.

"He also either took with him or

threw out the bag ir which he claimed

to be carrying a bomb."

Himmelsbach declined to describe

the device in detail, for security rea- •

sons. But it was earlier described as a

crude, unsophisticated device apparent-

ly consisting of highway flares and a

when they think the statute of limita-

"Cooper could not have known,

where he was when he jumped," Him-

plane was on instruments in the higher

"The first week in January, 1972,

That makes it a capital

ctime. If he had any accomplices, which

is not Indicated by any evidence so far,

they would be equally guiity."

To back up his conclusions, Hins-

melsbach for the first time, told the

detalled story of the hijacking:

"Cooper

was given

four

para-

chutes," Himmeisbach said. "He cut the

shroud lines on one of the best para-

chutes and used them to tie the 10,000

$20 bills to his beit in a bag before he

bailed out.

"He left behind the two best para-

chutes - a sky diver parachute with a)

32-foot canopy and a chest pack de-

signed primarily for use as a second

parachute.

"He wore a pilot's seat pack para-

chute with a 28-foot canopy. He also

took with him a chest pack parachute.

used-for training. It was unusable. The

panels were sewn together. If it had

been usable he could not have attached

it to his parachute harness, which had

no D rings for use with a chest pack. No

one who knew anything about para-

chutes would have made this many' mis-

takes.

"He also either took with him or

threw out the bag in which he clalmed

• to be carrying a bomb."

Himmelsbach declined to describe

the device in detail, for security nua-

sous. But it was earlier described as a

crude, unsophisticated device apparent-

iy consisting of highway flares and af

battery.

He left no fingerprints in the place,

but did leave a couple of items which

the FBl is not revealing because they.

could heip identify the hifteker or con-

found any of the expected phony fame

seekers who may claim to be Cooper

when they thlnk the statute of limita-

tions has expired.

"Cooper could not have known

Where he was when he jumped," Him-

melsbach said.

"He did not know the

cxact route of flight or the altitude. The'

plane was on Instruments In the higher

of two layers of clouds all the way from

Seattle to the vicinity of La Center.

"There was a radio marker beacon

in the general arer. but it was out of

service. The hijacker could not have

seen the ground and could not have de-

termined his position by any kind of

radio receiver, it he had one, which we

don't know for sure. There was no way

he could have known within miles of

where he was.

"It was a stormy night, with treez-

ing rain at his altitude and winds gust-

"along the Lewis River where he bailed

to the ground.

"As the load left the stairway it re

tracted to within elght inches of clos-

ing, then dropped back down. The re

sult was a marked flucquation in the

cabin air pressure which caused the

crews' ears to pop and registered a rap-

id change in the rate of pressurization

on instruments in the cockpit.

"Rataczak said: 'That's just the way

it was at 8:10 p.m. Nov. 24. Only the

crew didn't know what it meant then.

They didn't know he had bailed out

untll they landed at Reno and found the

plane empty."

The sare rapid fluctuations in air

pressure were noted in three ballouts

from

727 airliners in the next few

months, before the FAA ordered all rear

doors rigged so they could not be

opened in flight.

"There has not been a successitl

hijacking in the U.S since,*-Himmels-

bach emphasized. "And none of the hi-

with a bomb threat.

The statute of limitations on the widely publi

he will not be subject to arrest and prosecution

after that date.

It does not mean, however, that Cooper can feel

free to surface and start spending the money. The

owes the government back taxes totaling more

than $218,000 on his plunder, including interést

and penalties. A Longview FBI agerit, however,

Regardless of what happens, Cooper remains

the most celebrated, if that's the proper word, of

On the date, a man calling himself :Dan Cooper

(it somehow became D.B. Cooper in rews stories

about the crime) bought a ticket in Portland for a

flight to Seattle.

After boarding a Northwest Airlines jetliner,

the man-described as calm, middle-aged and

well-dressed, gave a stewardess a note shortly

after takeoff.

The stewardess, Florence Schaffner, then 23, of

Minneapolis, Minn., said later, "I thought he was

trying to hustle me. I stuffed the note in my

purse, and he motioned that I should read it."

The note, according to officials involved in the

hijacking investigation, said the man had a bomb,

, and wanted to go to Mexico.

At a waterfront bar in Papeete, Tahiti. I heard one of the

most bizarre sea stories of our tine.

Would you believe that D. B. Cooper, who bailed out of a

Western Airlines plane five years ago with a fortune in cash,

may be cruising the world's occans aboard John Alden's

"Malabar VIl" from Dolphin Marina?

"It's our favorite fantasy," yacht broker Dan Streuch of

British West Indies and the Bahamas aboard the 54-foot

"Malabar VII," one of a dozen and a half boats personally

owned by Alden at launching, was offered for sale by the

Streeches who left her in Fort Lauderdale and returned to the

West Coast, Dan to Dana Point where he began selling boats,

and his dad to the family home in Arizona.

"This man who called himself Mike Selzer decided to buy.

may have bought ours because we were willing to take his

camper as a trade-in. This was about two months after

Cooper had made his getaway from the airplane.

"Solver drove his camper to my folks' home in Arizona, and

they spent a lot of tie visiting before he took off for Florida,

My dad says Scler mentioned he har worked as a smoke

jumper."

Six weeks after Selzer delivered the camper "nearly new.

turned us in Las Vegas."

"Malahar VI!" with new owner Mike Selzer has never

urned un anywhere. Dan added.

BACK PACKING IN FRENCH POLYNESTA

Dan was on his way to the Tahiti airport after three wecks

of hiking around the islands of Tahiti. Moorea, Huahine,

Raiatea and Bors Bora with a back pack. He'd gone from one

island to nother as a passenger on the copra boat "Tapera

III," hiki: Jays and sleping nights ca tre beaches. He said

the land-cribs didn't chew on him (the local rumor that keeps

visitors from camping on the beaches) and very few mosquitos

took a bite: "I was taking Vitamins B 12 and B 6 and ]

understand if you do that, the mosquitos aren't interested.

Anyway, I only got one or two bites a duy."

He spent about $300 in three weeks (plus 5750 round-trip

air fare from Los Angeles) and most of the places where he

camped were near native huts "and the Tahitians brought me

food." He revalled buying "mostly uread, with lots of peanut

butter and jelly."

In his back pack: a sleeping bag, a bedsheet. swim fins and

mask, Sterne and freeze-dried food, one pair of long pants,

one pair of cut-ofts, a swim suit "and three or four shirts."

On Bora Bota. Dan spent two days reading a ship's log kept

he best hotel-bargain has got to be a place in Tahiti near

Jowntown Papcete where you pay 150 francs (52:14) for a

room. Unless you want a door, then it's 200 francs.

•Across from the cruising boats on Papeete's waterfront is

the Stewart Hotel (about $10), a favorite among cruising

peopic who want to get off their boats. At the opposite end of

the spectrum are the big glassy high-rise hotels where you pay

$50 ind more to meet other tourists.

I stumbled into a happy compromise: the aging Te Puna Be

Americans and Europeans who visit Tahiti often. Quiet,

and

inexpensive by Tahiti standards (about

$20-522), it's sandwiched between two American-style luxury

hotels and you can hike over to their white-sand beaches.

One of

the charins of the Te Puna Bel Air is its

inconsistencies: I mer four women from Sacramento who were

staying there and they had no hot water (l did), I had a wasp

ISLAND-HOPPING BY BOAT

Inter-islard freighters offer expeditions for visitors: one is a

40 day trip with stops at 116 islands and atolis. and it costs

- about $300. For the visitor on a briet vacation, John Stegenga

of the schooner "Candide," four years out of Marina del Rey,

suggested this one which he look:

"The 'Timi Hani,' a 150 foot diesel freighter, leaves

Pancate every Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. You sicep on deck with

cfler travelers, including many Tahitians who sing and dance

at night; and there re always people playing guitars.

*The freighter puts in a Huahini, Raiatca, Tahaa and Bora

Bora and you go ashore and buy food at the Chinese grocery

stores that are always close to the docks. You cook on deck.

"The 'Timi Hani' brings you back to Papcete on Sunday or

Monday and you have spent about 700 franes ($10) plus

grozerics for a weck-long tour of some of the most beautiful

islands T the South Pacific."

PREFACE

The 1970 version of the USPA Directory is

an expanded publication and considerably

• more complete than earlier editions which

listed only those drop zones operated by

affiliated clubs.

By means of a survey type questionnaire

we have been able to list many drop zone

facilities for which previously there was little

or no information available. As a word of cau-

tion; this solicited information has not always

been verifiable, and the reader should there-

fore be prepared for occasional discrepancies

between the reported and the actual facilities

available at some DZs. Generally, those drop

zones which have been visited by a USPA staff

member (preceded by a star) and those op-

erated by USPA affiliated clubs should be con-

sidered the most reliably reported.

In the event the reader discovers an error in

the listed information, or has suggestions for

the revision of future editions, please send

these comments to Box 109, Monterey, Cali-

fornia.

It is hoped that this new format of a State

by State breakdown of drop zones, area safety

officers, FAA facilities, and the USPA affiliated

clubs will provide an easily referenced index

of the information most necessary to users of

this Directory.

This publication is presented as a service of

the United States Parachute Association and is

current as of 1 May 1970.

represented by a Conference Director elected by the

members of that conference.

The twelve Conference

Directors share the responsibility of governing the USPA

with ten National Directors who are popularly elected

by the national membership. These twenty-two Direc-

tors are elected for two-year terms and meet as the

Board of Directors twice annually during those terms.

Their directives and the daily administration of the or-

ganization are managed by a full-time executive staff

headquartered in Monterey, California.

Re memo by SA|

dated 11/27/71.

Referenced memo sets forth information regarding

a KABC talk show wherein a caller called in and thought the

unknown subject in this case

might be her husband.

The radio station did not obtain any identifying

data of the caller and there is no way that she will be able

to be identified based on information we have in this phase.

A tape recording of this female and her conversation was

obtained. The tape recording has been transcribed and is

attached to this memo.

I have reviewed this transcription and there is no

information to Indicate who the caller was

who the individual

she was talking about or anything else that would make it

logical to pursue this phase any further.

Based on review of

numerous complaint forms Irom

duty Special Agent's, it does not appear that the caller has

furnished information set out in the transcribed tape recording

to this office.

It is recommended no further action be taken.

But why would he do such a thing as this?

Why did he leave me after seven years?

I don't know. But that, only he can answer. But

why do you think he would jump out of an airplane

badly?

Female:

Not really, because he was the kind of a guy that

didn't really care much about money but he knew

what money could do.

Is he the type of man that would do such a thing,

do you know?

would do that?

I would like to find out if you contact the FBI

On 12/3/71 SAs

reviewed registration cards of parachutists who have

jumped from the Elsinore Paricenter at skylark Field,

Elsinore, california.

It should be noted that there are approximately

25,000 registration cards on file going back to 1957,

however, records containing descriptive data only go back

to sometime during 1969.

Each person tho makes a jump at Elsinore must

fill out a registration card before making a jump, regardless

of how much prior experience they have had elsewhere.

on succeeding jumps, if the individual is not known,

card is roferred to and the jumper may jump without

filling out any further logs or cards. Although receipts

are given to jumpers when they pay for tickets to jump,

names are not recorded.

After reviewing the registration cards, all

cards where the individual was between 35 - 55 years of

age and was between 519 - 6'1, and between 150 - 190

pounds, was pulled aside and photographed, including

narginal descriptions.

The title is marked "Changed" to reflect the code word

"NORJAK" to facilitate the handling of the numerous communica-

tions in connection with this investigation. This matter was

formerly captioned, "Unsub; Northwest Airlines Flight 305,

11/24/71, CAA - Hijacking.

00: Seattle." All offices are

instructed to use the code word "NORJAK" in all communications

in this investigation.

In connection with the additional dissemination of

the ransom list already furnished the field, all offices are

instructed to further disseminate this list on any basis

considered practical and appropriately advise the Bureau and

office of origin of any positive information developed.

The

loot in this matter consists entirely of $20 bills and it is

questionable that large banks and bank-type institutions would

effectively screen their $20 bills due to the volume of this

type of bill that would be handled.

All offices should insure that the composite drawing

of the unknown subject is thoroughly disseminated to parachute

And alias D. B. Cooper was highly orig-

final. He exited from a 727 in flight with

$200,000 strapped to his middle-aged body,

and no one had thought of doing that be-

fore.

3' But Dr. Otto Larsen, a University of

Washington sociologist, thinks Cooper

cornered the publie taney for reasons far

more complex. "It was an awesome feat

in the battle of man against machine," he

said. "One man overcoming, for the time

being anyway, technology, the corpora-

tion, the Establishment and the system."

People-watchers with Ph. D.'s are al-

ways carrying on like that. Skip a stone

¿across a puddle and they accuse you of

manifesting a desire to walk on water.

Tell them you almost have to admire a

middie-aged man who parachutes from a

727 with $200,000, and they suggestit's

actually gratitude you're feeling because

she beat the Establishment.

D. B. Cooper was not out to beat the

•Establishment for us. Nor the corpora-

tion, the system or technology. He was out

"to beat Northwest Airlines out of 200

grand. For himself. For the same, simple,
