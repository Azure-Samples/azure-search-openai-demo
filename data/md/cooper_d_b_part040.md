He recalls that they left Montreal on Highway 25,

going north. They traveled north on Highway 25 approximately

five miles from Montreal, at which time Highway 25 passed

under Highway 640.

They stayed on Highway 25 for another

seven or eight miles, at which time Highway 25 runs into

Highway 341. They took a left on Highway 341 and went two

or three miles on Highway 341. After traveling the two or

three miles on Highway 341, they turned right on a paved

road which was marked with a sign which contained the

letters

"OAK," followed by possibly an "E," followed by

"RD." They traveled on this road for approximately one and

one half miles, at which time they came to a farmhouse on

the left side of the road, which was the only farmhouse on

this road.

Located adjacent to the farmhouse was a barn.

The farmhouse was a white frame house, which had approxi-

mately ten rooms, and the barn was constructed of natural-

looking wood.

Just prior to arriving at the farmhouse,_

told

him that the man who owned the house was an American named

D. B. COOPER, who is the person who hijacked an airplane

somewhere in

the northwestern part of the United States and

jumped out of the airplane over a mountainous area and who

had never been caught.

Upon arriving at the farmhouse, he could tell

Re Portland airtel to Seattle, 8/10/78.

On 10/11/78, one day prior to his trial in

Stockton, California,

ROBERT RACKSTRAW rented a $55,000

plane from Bridgeford Flying Service and later that

day called in a "Mayday" advising that his plane was

fire and he was forced to ditch in the ocean approxi-

mately 12 miles out of Monterey, California.

Investigation by the U.S. Coast Guard failed

to find any sign of wreckage and

it is believed that

subject flew the plane to Mexico.

In view of the above, Sacramento is conducting

no further investigation on this matter; however, if

subject is located and arrested he will be returned to

Stockton, California and major case prints will be

obtained.

would indicate a disparity of approximately 20 years, and RACKSTRAW

would not appear to be a very good suspect.

RACKSTRAW has been the subject of highly publicized

prosecution for major crimes in California, and is now incar-

cerated in a California penitentiary. The Sacramento OIIICE

advised in May, 1978, that at that time RACKSTRAW was ir

custody feigning a back injury which required him to be transported

in a wheelchair. Custodial personnel felt he was doing this in

an attempt to effect a possible escape.

It was noted that

RACKSTRAW is a former U. S. Army Green

highly skilled in the use of his hands and feet as weapons.

RE: DB Cooper

Dear Agent

On 22 February 2000, the History Channel presented a 30 minute documentary called

. b6

b7C

not believe what I was seeing. Then the announcer said, "Robert Wesley Rackstraw, age

35 was being held on another arrest charge and was later cleared in the D.B. Cooper

case." I could not believe what I had just seen, but from the profile of the hijacker, I can

see why Robert W. Rackstraw would have been a suspect.

This letter is not really about DB Cooper, but rather about Robert W. Rackstraw and who

he really is, if anyone knows.

I am a former Air Force Officer and recently took an early retirement from

CA. I was

Jfor the military and JPI.

Last summer, University of Riverside Extension offered an accelerated (4 week)

certificate program in Conflict Management. I felt that with

Mediation and Arbitration would allow me to use my background to start a

new career. Robert W. Rackstraw was

Jand taught Mediation Il

Robert Rackstraw held himself out as an attorney, but finally stated he had a JD but had

not taken or passed any state bar exam. I have my JD, and I asked him where he got his

degree, he mentioned several different schools but you could not get him to state the

exact school or year he graduated.

He bragged about all the international arbitration and mediation he did for a living. He

then told our class about all his military experiences. Robert was very hard to pin down to

specifics or time frames. He mentioned or bragged about all types of military operations,

awards etc. The man would have had to be over 100 years old to do all he said he has

done in life. His military career was like Forrest Gump. He was in on every action, some

CIA, that our country has encountered since WWII.

Robert showed me a picture in an Army Class A uniform with jump wings, and pilot

wings. Since I have three children in the military, two of them at West Point, and being

former Air Force Officer, he talked to me about his military experience

formed a group to conduct mediation and

arbitrations. Because of his "experience" in mediation and arbitration, we asked Robert if

he wanted to join our group to set up a web site.

He agreed to join our group but provided a very limited resume for our website. He listed

BS, BS, JD and LLM but gave no school. He them mentioned mediating 3100 cases but

he was never specific. We worked on expanding his resume but had very little facts to

Our group is composed of professional's in law, contracts, real estate and government.

After seeing the History Channel program, I taped the second showing and got our group

together to review the tape. We are all in agreement that the man shown on the History

Channel, "In Search of, DB Cooper" is Robert Wesley Rackstraw, a member of our

mediation group. He was 35 when he was a suspect in the DB Cooper case. That was

1979, and he would be 56, which is his age now.

Our concern is that Robert Rackstraw holds himself out as a non practicing attorney,

dealing with all the various judges, courts and dispute centers of Riverside and the

surrounding areas. He was hired for a short time at UCR Extension as director of Public

Law and Policy. The FBI had him arrested for something else and he was a suspect in

the DB Cooper case. Our group is very concerned being associated with him, if he has a

felony record.

Our group has tried to check him out and has been unable to find any law school from

which he might have graduated, the address he gives in Lake Elsinore is an industrial

park and his military experience is very questionable.

The History Channel stated that he was arrested, it did not say convicted. We would like

to know if we should be concerned about associating professionally with this man.

The group has always been concerned about Robert and his stories but felt it was better to

have him on our side, than to have him mad at us because of his mouth and contacts all

over the court system.

There are a few of us that feel that maybe you did have your man and he talked his way

out of the situation. The man is very much a loner. They stated the suspect wore sun

glasses, was a chain smoker, had military experience, possible jump and flying

experience. Robert matches all of those clues. We have checked and he owns no property

in California, he has several different email addresses, and phones that forward to other

numbers. Just a strange man. None of us would be surprised if he was DB Cooper.

Please let us know if any infermation on Robert Rackstraw's arrest is open to thie public

forreview and if so how we can obtain a copy.

Dear

In reference to your letter dated February 29, 2000

concerning Robert Rackstraw, I am sorry to tell you that the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can't assist you with what

you are looking for.

While arrest records are usually

considered open records, the FBI can only supply an arrest recora

about a living person to

another person if the person whose

record is being sought signs a waiver giving up his privacy

rights.

As for the issue of Mr. Rackstraw passing himself off

as an attorney, you may want to contact California law

enforcement authorities.

Most states have laws making it illegal

to practice law without

a license.

For your information, I will pass your letter on to

those investigating the D.B. Cooper case.

Sincerely,

Charles E. Mandigo
