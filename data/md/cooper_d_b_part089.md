To Whom It May Concern:

МГ .

Duane L. weber was an employee of Interlock Screw:

and, Bolt Corporation For approximately one (1) year.

His past record with this company was ohe of the best.

He started here as Sales Desk Representative and worked

his way up to Purchasing Agent of Interlock in this

Branch.

As. his former supervisor,

I would like to say that his

attendance was perfect, his attitude very good, quality

of work was very good,

quantity of work was excellent,

and his relationship with his fellow employees was the

very best:

I would recommend tir. Weber for employment with any

company because of his qualifications and his past re-

cord with our company.

Unfortunately when our company was faced with a cut-

back of employees due to circumstances we had to re-

lease some of our manpower in order to survive. -Mr.

weber being one of the younger members of our organis

zation was faced with release.

It is

sincerely hoped that this correspondence will

serve

as

a spokesman in

Mr. Webers

behalf.

sincerely,
