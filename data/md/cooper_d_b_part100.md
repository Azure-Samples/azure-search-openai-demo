On the 727, the rear stairs cannot be lowered fron

the pilot's compartment.

They can be lowered only from the

passenger compartment in the rear of the plane or externally

if the plane is on the ground.

advised that once the operation of the rear

stairs has started there is no way to stop them until they

have extended to the full position. On the ground when the

rear stairs are extended, the weight of the stairs actually

carries them to the full open position. If the stairs are

extended in flight, the pressure of the wind keeps them from

opening to the full position.

On several occasions

extended the rear stairs while in flight.

This was done at speeds of approximately 150 knots. Opening

the rear stairs in flight at speeds at 150 to 170 knots would

not suck any items from the passenger cabin.

There would be

a slight change in pressurization but this would not remove

any papers or cushions from the passenger cabin.

individual known to him as MIKE SULLIvAn, who worked with ADAMS

as a volunteer fireman in the kellogg, Idaho, Volunteer Fire

obtained work as a baggage handler for one of the major airlines,

although, ADAMS could not remember which airline SULLIVAN worked

ADAMS stated that he has not seen SULLIVAN SinCe SULLIVAN

left the fire department and traveled to California.

ADAMS thought SULLIVAN would have been in his mid to late

20s at the time of the hijacking incident. ADAMS stated SULLIVAN

was approximately 6'0 tall, well built, 150-160 pounds, having

dack black hair which may have been curly, and sometimes wore a

RE: DANIEL, LEWIS COOPER

SAC TOM FARRON Called from Springfield on

12/1/71. He says they have developed a suspect in one

DANIEL LENIS COOPER who was a Groon Beret; is a con

man; has an arrest record and has a hobby of aviation.

They

have a photo which is 10 years old, but they think it is a

good photo and it looks like the composite.

They are going to send us a teletype and put

the photo on the facsimile machine.

I requested also that they send it to

Minneapolis and that they pursue this vigorously in ordex

to determine COOPER's background and particularly where

he is now.

Major

axwoll Air Force Baso, Almbama, advised he is acquainte

ith sport parachutists and skydivine activities in th

northwestern section of the United States.

The U.S. Parachute Association has divided the

country up into about seven rogions with a total menbership

of about 25,000 to 30, 000 pooplo.

He further indicated that ho firmly beloved that

If this had been a skydiver who committed the hijacking, the

skydiver would not have come from the Northwest section

of the

United States.

He belleved that sinco most skydivers know each

other in a section of the country, this would preclude it being

an individual from that section of the country.

MAJOr

Jadvisoú the jump tom 10,000 fcot in

bad weather is not a great physical feat and there would be no

problem in jumping at that altitude in bad weather.

He advised

that an individual would not need jump boots and stated that

he, himself, has skydived with tonnis shoes on.

At this time Major

was shown an artist con

ception of an individual,

allegedly the hijacker of Northwest

Air lines flight sos, and he indicated he did not know anybody

an his section of the country who tit this description.

Major I

further stated that whoever sot up the hijacking

operation in this casc knew quite a lot about airplanos.

further indicated that probably the roason behind the four

parachutes given to the hijackor was that the hijacker wantod

to test the good faith of the people on the ground inasmuch as

a skydiver would be able to tell whother or not parachutes wore

operable. He tuxther

indicated that if two parachutes were left.

bohind in the aircraft, the hijacker could have dropped onc

chuto:and activated it as a decoy to ward off any trailing nir-

craft,

and then could have batled out after the decoy "chute was

dropped.
