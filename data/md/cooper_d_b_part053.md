THE AVIATION INDUSTRY has estimated

are being borne by the airports and airlines,

Most of the major carriers already have

asked the Civil Aeronautics Board to authorize

modest fare increases.

Uncle Sam, instead, to pick up the tab. Either

By BYRON JOHNSRUD

Soft breezes brush the fir and hemlock

along the Lewis River dividing Clark and

Cowlitz Counties in what, natives say, has

"been the loveliest autumn in years."

Bright leaves spiral down and an occa-

sional cone chunks into the leafy under-

growth.

But, alas. Nary a D. B. Cooper $20 bill.

So now, on the anniversary of the first

parachute-skyjacking, D. B. Cooper grows

larger than life in lore and legend in the

area. But what actually may have happened

to him is as much a mystery as ever.

"About the best we can do in the way of

Cooper bills," said Anna Friday of Ariel,

"are some reasonable facsimiles. The Oaks

Restaurant has printed its Thanksgiving

menu on them. as a sort of anniversary me-

mento, Cooper and Thanksgiving all in one."

IT WAS a misty,

cloudy, miserable

Thanksgiving Eve when Cooper, obviously

an alias, jumped from a Northwest Orient

Airlines 727, $200,000 in $20 bills attached to

his person.

Along with the ransom, he had asked for

four parachutes and (demanded that the plane

be fidwn at 10,000 feet and 200 miles an hour.

When the 727 landed at Reno, Cooper, the

money and one of the parachutes were gone.

The Ariel-La Center-Woodland area has.been

fixed as the most probable spot of his drop..

"Around here," said Mrs. Friday, a writ-

er on The Lewis River News, "people de-:

plore the horrors of the skyjackings that

came after. But Cooper never hurt anybody

Mrs. Friday wrote a Cooper skyjacking

Only at the end of the se-

Bones found

in rugged

Cougar area

COUGAR. — Cowlitz County' sheriff's

deputies went into a rugged area near

Cougar today to check what were re-

ported to be human bones found by

• three hunters on Sunday.

The sheriff's office reported that the

'bones were found in an area east of Cin-

namon Peak, which is about three and

one-half miles north of Cougar, not

far from the Skamania County line.

The remains were scattered over a

large area; the hunters reported.

No clothing was found, and deputies

said the identity probably would have

to be established through examination

of the teeth.

Hunters who found the bones weife

pi Amboy and Glen C. Johnson of Cam

His.

• The area being checked is brush and

tree covered

containing

' lava

caves.

Although identification of the victim

would be only speculation at this time,

the area is not far from where James

Annis, 16, of Hockinson, disappeared

while on a hunting trip in November

1971.

Annis apparently was seen for the.

last time by two hunters southeast of

Grass Lake, which is on the Cowitz-

Skamania county line. This is northeast

of Cougar and southeast of Cinnamon

Peak.

Some speculation also has been voicell

that the remains might be those of D. E

Cooper, who parachuted from a jet lind

with ransom money late last. year. The

The following information concerning the $25,000

reward being offered by Northwest Orient Airlines was made

available to various organizations and newspapers in the

Woodland, Washington, area:

On October 12, 1972, SA THOMAS J. MANNING gave a

speech to the "Cowlitz Game and Anglers Society."

At that

time, SA MANNING passed out the circular describing the location

which UNSUB parachuted into as well as information on the

reward to approximately 200 members of the society.

On October 18, 1972, SAC, Seattle, spoke to the

Longview Rotary Club and, in addition, distributed approximately

130 information circulars.

Information contained in the circular made available

to the Vancouver "Columbian" newspaper, Longview, Washington,

SKYJACKING: THE PLANE STORY OF D.B. COOPER

It's the crime with the "young look."

Everyone hates the airlines. Everyone

loves a hijacker. If the thought of being

considered anti-social has kept you from

a life of crime, consider the crime with

the wings onl

Before 1960 there were only 33 air-

craft hijackings. In the last ten years

there have been 150. More than half of

these have been in the U.S. Clearly air-

of Cubans, unhappy with the new gov-

the Cuban pilot wasn't'a part of the rip-

off and as a result, he was wounded, à

guard was killed, and the plane limped

into Key West, Florida. The gunmen

were hailed as Freedom Fighters.

Then on July 24, 1961, the worm

turned.

An American plane, an Eastern Air-

lines Electra with 38 passengers on

board, was forced to fly to Cuba. The

U.S. Air Force was notified of the ac-

tion when the plane was en route. They

sent up a F-102. which flew helplessly

since the Bay of Pigs. America wasn't

looking for more: trouble.

The Electra made a safe landing. The

passengers and crew--only

months

after a Bay of Pigs invasion-were sent

back to Miami.

Not the Electra. Why should it be

sent back? Uncle Sam had kept the last

land as "D.B. Cooper" literally vanished

into the air that November night and as

this issue went to press nothing new had

been unearthed in the recent search.

This fact, coupled with a popular theory

that the skyjacker ended up entangled

in a tree in below-freezing weather and

never made it any farther, may make look-

ing for "D.B. Cooper" and the $200,000

ransom a recreational fad on the Lewis

River this summer.

"Cooper' Swindle Charged

Herei

BY CRAIG SMITH -

Two Kitsap County men were arrested

yesterday and charged in federal

cou't

with scheming to swindle a former News-

week contributing editor out of $45,000 in

return for an "exclusive interview" with

airline skyjacker "D. B. Cooper."

Arrested and held in King County Jail

following

a bail hearing were

• William

John Lewis, 32, of Seavue Estates,

Sea-

beck, also known as Jack Lewis, and Don-

aid Sylvester Murphy, 49, of 540-4th Ave.,

Bremerton.

U.S. Attorney Stan' Pitkin said during

the bail hearing he believes the two men

have $30,300 obtained from Karl Payne

Fléming,

the former Newsweek

editor,

who got the money from Platypus Publica-

tions, Inc., of Los Angeles. An affidaiit by

FBI Agent Charles E, F'arrell said $15,000

was to be paid when Fleming was con-

vinced he was talking to the hijacker,

$15,000 to be paid after the inverviews and

a final

$15,000 after publication of the

story.

• The complaint said Fleming gave Lew-

is $300 for expenses.

The complaint said Fleming conducted

interviews with Murphy, who was dis-

guised as "Cooper," on Feb. 22 and 23.

According to the complaint, the sound

man and cameraman recording the inter-

view Feb. 23 at a Seattle-area beach had

to work from "an extreme distance while

wearing earplugs"' to give "added credi-

bility 1o the fraudulent scheme." a

~"D. B., Cooper" is the name stu by a

Skyjacker

extorted

$200,000 from

Northwest Airlines, then apparently bailed

out with his money after the plane left Se

attle en route to Reno last Thanksgiving

eve. "Cooper" has not been arrested.

Pitkin said Newsweek was not a party

lo the interview agrecment and

Fleming is no longer employed by the

magazine.

Bail for Lewis has been set at $50,000,

$5,000 ol which must be posted in a cash-

ier's check and the remainder in a proper-

ty-bond agreement to be signed by his

wife and parents. Murphy, who told Us

Magistrate Charles Schaaf that he went

bankrupt two scars ago, is required lo

post an $8,000

cashier's check or "suffi-.

cient sureties."

the complaint said the scheme started

after Fleming placed a classified adver.

tisement Feb. 1 seeking a confidential in-

terview with "Cooper."

The complaint says Fleming flew to Se-

attle, and on Feb. 16 met Murphy who was

disguised as "Cooper" at an airport mo-

tel.

On Feb. 21 according to the govern-

ment, copies of three $20 bills said to have

ween taken in the hijacking were shown to

Fleming. In the complaint, the govern-

ment said the bilis in the copy were phon-

ies because serial numbers of hijack mon-

ey had been superimposed.

The government claims that on the

same day Fleming paid $30,000 to Lewis,

Who was acting as the go-between lising

the name "Seth Thomas,

'and that on the

next day, the interviews began.

The search for skyjacker "D. B. Cooper"

$200,000 ransom last Thanksgiving eve from

Northwest Airlines officials in Seattle.

At least one of the photographs appear-

That photo - of a man with stylish long,

dark hair - apparently was taken on the

sidewaik in front of Li'H. King Imports,

Another 'Look-alike' Has

Problems With Police

LOS ANGELES - (AP) - A suburban West Covina

• man says he was detained by police three hours because

he resembles the Northwest Orient Airlines plane hi-

jacker who parachuted to freedom after

$200,000.

Jiri Fencl, 38, said Monday that he was picked up by

police at Sacramento Airport four days after the Nov. 24

hijacking and questioned and photographed by officers.

"I went through it calmly because I knew I was

innocent," Fenel said

Authorities are still looking for a middle-aged man

identified as "D. B. Cooper" who bailed out of a Boeing

727 jet last month between Seattle and Reno, Nev., after

extorting the $200,000 with a bomb threat.

The FBI has reported no leads in the Case - and has

not said whether other middle-aged men with parachut-

ing experience have been questioned.

Fencl said when he was arrested he had $800 in his.

wallet to pay a moving van company for transporting his

property from Rocklin, near Sacramento, to West Covina.

He said a card in his wallet indicated he had been an

Army parachutist, and a check of his driver's lidense

further disclosed he once had lived in Seattle.

Fencl is the new manager of the Pomona Natiónal

WHILE WITNEY'S facial features

resembled the F. B. I. composite

witnesses, his height, weight, age and

complexion didn't match those given

for the hijacker.

Whitney is 5-feet-s and about 140

pounds. Witnesses said the hijacker

was 6 feet and 175 pounds. They said

the hijacker had an olive complexion.

Whitney is fair-skinned. The hijacker

was described as middle-aged - be-

prematurely receding hair.

Hijacker

Hunt Near

Woodland

BY DICK CLEVER

The search for the skydiving hijacker of

a Northwest Airlines 727 jetliner was nar

rowed yesterday to a five-mile corridor in

upper Clark County, sources said.

Meanwhile, The Post-Intelligencer

learned that one of the two parachutes ap-

parently used by the hijacker who escaped

with $200.000 ransom was a nou-functional

training chule.

Linn Emrick, of Sky Sports, Inc.. said

he supplied the two chest pack parachutes

that were put onto the plane Wednesday al

Seattle-Tacoma Airport.

" The hijacker, known as "D. B. Cooper"

to the FBI, had demanded the money

parachutes before releasing the 36 pasten-

ga's and two

stewardesses. He comman-

deered the plane on a flight -from Portland

to Seattle.

Passengers and crewmen described the

hijacker

as in his mid-forties, with dark i

hair,

about 6-feet-1,

175 pounds, wearing

a black business

suit and dark

giasses.

They said he was

"very cool."

Along

with the two, chestpack chutes

from Sky Sports, located in Issaquah, the

hijacker was provided with two backpack

chutes by Norman Hayden, of Renton Avia-

tion.

The parachules were obtained by North-

midnight, the night of the hijacking.

After he heard the noise he got a shotgun and rifle and

put them by his chair, he said.

But the person who had tried Hatfield's back door didn't

push again, and Hatfield never fired, and it was too "lealy"

to see any footprints the next day, Hatfield said.

Earlier Wednesday Hatfield had been in Woodland,!

: As of last night, the hijacker's identity

remained a mystery, as did the wherea

composite sketch of a thin, dark, middle-

aged man wearing dark glasses.

And FBI agents vowed to search the en-

flown by the hijacked Boeing 27.

Along with the FBI sketch, a personality

WOODLAND, Clark County - (UPI) - A parade of

antos, pickup trucks and motorcycles wound through the

olling foothills of the Cascade Mountains yesterday, carry

1g people seeking a fortune that might never be founc

In fact, although the Federal Bureau Investigation was

üsing the Southwest Washington foothills as their operations

base in searching for the hijacker, they were merely work

ing on a hunch no solid evidence- that he had bailed out in

the area.

BUT THEY came anyway, 1971-style gold rushers tempt-

ed by the lure of easy money and undaunted by the long

odds against their success.

In a gas station, three Portland-area girls home fron

college for the Thanksgiving holiday admitted they enter

tained fantasies of finding the hijacker's loot.

One girl identified herself only as Anita. She and her two

companions had driven to this area "just to have a look

around." That was the initial reason.

Would she turn it in? Anita smiled.

"It would be tempting to keep it," sie said, "even il

they offered a reward for its return."

A YOUNG farmer in a battered pickup truck stopped at

a combination gas station-general store at one of the maity

crossroads in the search area.

As he manned the gas puny himself, his two children

smiled and waved from the cab of the pickup. At first his

story was that he was "headed into Battle Ground for a few

things at the grocery."

But as the conversation covered the lijacking and the

unusually heavy traffic on the North Clark County roads,

his talk turned to "what a man could do with that kind of

money."

He removed an old rag from tie cab, carefully wiped

some spilled gas from the side of the truck and commented

how "evert a good Christian man" would be tempted to keep

the money.

"A lot of people in Clark County are having to go on

welfare because they lost jobs," he said,

"and a man could

buy himselt a pretty nice farm with that kind ofanoney?..

even if he had to go lo Australia."

Washington countryside

with his $200,000 ransom money.

At least that's the best hunch law offi-

cers had to work with yesterday, based on

information passed to them by Northwest's

headquarters in Mineapolis.

• The "cool" middle-aged air pirate, who

vanished Wednesday night somewhere be-

tween Seattle and Reno, Nev., left law offi-

cers and airline oficials stunned by disbe-

lief. Some even expressed admiration for

the hijacker's skill and daring.

"You have to admire the guy, in a

way," said one Clark County deputy pri-

vately.

. "If he made it, he's really pulled

one off."

Crew members of the 727 jetliner said

in Minneapolis yesterday they had no idea

when the hijacker parachuted from the

plane.

capt. William Scott, pilot of the air

craft, said the hijacker ordered the rea

door of the plane opened shortly after take-

off from Seattle-Tacoma Airport.

"We never heard from him again, but

we assumed he was there," Scott said.

The hljacker had enforced his demands

for money and parachutes by displaying i

device

made from two red cylinders con-

nected by wires to a briefcase.

Tina Mucklow, the stewardess who re-

mained aboard for the flight to Reno after

the 36 passengers and

radioed to Northwest

"Everything is ready for your ai-

Flight 305 had been in the air for

more than 2% hours,

much too long

for a flight from Portland to Seattle,

A calm hijacker was in control i

the 80-ton Boeing 727 and he hat

refused to allow the plane to land un-

flot Bill Scott radios to the tower:

"We will ask you to stay right there

The hijacker apparently had suent

much of the fight in a rear lavalory

with his hostage, stewardess Tina

Muckiow.

Flight 305 rolls south along runway

1GR and stops halfway down the field

about 2,000 yards west of the airport

the runway lights on bright?"

The hijacker had expressed a de-

sire to land in a lighted place, scoit

had messaged earlier, "so he can see

what's going on."

But now Scott replies to the lower:

"No, you better turn them down."

Immediately,

With the hijacker out of earshot of,

cussion between pilot and tower of

the options available to the crew once

the passengers are safely removed.

A Northwest Airlines ground super-

visor suggests by two-way radio that

the crew can evacuate the planc "and

*"'That's

37 Released

BY DICK CLEVER

A man who hijacked a Seattle-bound jet-

liner and collected $200,000 ransom here

before releasing 35 passengers and two

stewardesses had vanished by the time the

plane taxied to a stop in Reno last night.

The hijacker, thought to be armed with

a dynamite bomb, picked up the money

and four parachutes during a tense refuel-

ing stop at Seattle-Tacoma Airport before

ordering the crew of the Northwest Air-

lines 727 to fly him toward Mexico by way,

of Reno, Nev.

He was holding a stewardess, Tina Muck-

low, as a hostage in the rear of the plane.

Assoclated Press Writer

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - It has been three years since the

askyjacker called Dan Cooper parachuted from a Northwest

Airlines jet with $200,600 in ransom money and wrote himself

Into the folklore of the Pacific Northwest.

Two more and he'll be home free — if he's alive.

"The federal statute of limitations on that crime is fivé

years," said Sidney Lezak, U.S. attorney in Portland.

According to.the U.S. Department of Transportation, Cooper

is the only person ever to hijack a domestic airliner who has not

been killed or brought to justice:

"We know nothing more about him today than we did at 11

p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 24, 1971," says Julius Mattson, special

agent in charge of the Portland FBI office. "I just wish we had

He wanted 10,000 $20 bills to be delivered to him at Seattle in a

laundry sack, along with two sets of parachutes. Otherwise, he

would blow up the plane, he said:

Airline officials and FBI agents complied and Cooper allowed

the passengers and two of the three stewardesses to disembark

at Seattle.

Then he ordered the plane to fly south to Reno, Nev., at 200

** miles per hour, at 10,000 feet, flaps down. The crew was to stay

in the cockpit.

After takeoff from Seattle, a red light flashed in the cockpit

indicating the plane's rear boarding ramp had been unlatched.

Nothing was heard from Cooper for about 20 minutes. At8:10

The skyjacker,

carefully reclaimed his note-to the stewardess, had left no fin-

gerprints.

Authorities pinpointed Cooper's jump point near Woodland

Wash. The little town was transformed into a bustling command

post for a small army of newsmen, FBI agents, police and

soldiers from Ft. Lewis, Wash.

With planes, helicopters, jeeps and track dogs, they combed

the vast, densely wooded region northeast of Woodland:

The skyjacker had left the plane clad only in a light business

suit arid street shoes. He parachuted into the blackness of a*

raging thunderstorm, into a 200 m.ph. wind and 7-degrees-

below zero temperatures.

He could not have survived, the police reasoned. They were

simply looking for a body and a bag of money and that could

wait until the spring thaw. A week later, the searchers went

home.

Cooper soon became a legend.in the Northwest. A hit record-

ing lauded him as a Robin Hood who beat the establishment.

Somehow in the first hours

D.B. Cooper cropped up and.

cause the FBI was checking

on an individual whose name

he was in jail at the time of

the hijack.

When the hijacker bought

D.B.'s pants? 'Unlikely'

By DAVID KERN

Columbian Staff Writer

ARIEL - It is "highly unlikely" that the tattered

slacks found by hunter William Lynch on Green

Mountain near here could have been worn by famed

skyjacker Dan Cooper, according to a highly in-

formed law enforcement source.

"It is generally felt from looking at the crime

laboratory report that the pants are not five years

old," said the official, who asked that his name not

ferred to him as D.B. Cooper and the

initials stuck.

Wednesday the FBI sent the torn,

gray plaid pants to FBI laboratories in

Washington, D.C., for, analysis.

Agents said neither laundry nor

cleaning marks were found on the

trousers, nor were there any blood-

stains.

Back in Portland, the U.S. Attor-

ney's office, in what was described as

"an abundance of caution," secured an

indictment based on grand jury findings

against Dan Cooper for hijacking the

plane.

Jack G. Collins, first assistant U.S.

Attorney, said the indictment was

sought because there had been some

legal decisions that would contend a

five-year statute of limitations applies

to the case.

"It was out of an abundance of cau-

fion," Collins said, "that the indictment

was sought. We have no present knowl-

page of his (Cooper's) whereabouts."

He said the indictment was request-

ed by Deputy Atty. Gen Richard. Thorn-

burg, head of the criminal division of

the U.S. Justice Department.

• Collins said the penalty for air pira-

cy (Count 1 of the indictment) was a

prison term of not less than 20 years. If

anyone had been killed in the hijacking,

he said, the punishment would have

been a death sentence.

On Count 2 of the indictment, Col-

lins said, the maximum penalty is a

$10,000 fine or 20 years in prison or

both.

The government asked for a bench

warrant for Cooper's arrest and bail of

$500,000.

Cooper's official description is that

artist's conception of captioned unsub.

Shortly after 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST)

11/24/71, a lone white male traveling from Portland, Oregon, to

Seattle, Washington, on captioned flight displayed the contents of

his brief case to a stewardess indicating to her it was a bomb

which would be exploded unless his demands were met. The hijacker

indicated his willingness to exchange the safety of the 36 passen-

gers and crew for $200,000 in cash and four parachutes. He

instructed that the plane circle the Seattle airport until his

demands were met at which time the plane landed. Once the money

and parachutes were loaded and the plane was being refueled, the

hijacker allowed the passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane leaving a flight crew of three males and one female and

the hijacker aboard. The hijacker indicated a desire to fly to

Mexico City and instructed the plane to take off flying at a low

altitude and slow speed, maintaining a southerly direction. Upon

demand the hijacker was

instructed on lowering the rear passenger

door while the aircraft was in flight. He was last seen in the

aircraft by crew members at 8;05 p.I. PST, when he instructed

the hostage stewardess to go forward to the first class section and

close the curtains behind her.

Stewardess complied, going through

first class section into pilot's cockpit and locking door behind her.

Prior to departing from passenger cabin, hijacker told stewardess

the money bag was not in accordance with instructions and to cut

up one of the parachutes to rewrap the money, which was done. When

the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, for refueling, the hijacker,

two parachutes, the ransom money, and the vinyl brief case had

disappeared.

Investigation determined that the hijacker had purchased

his ticket at the Portland Airport shortly before the plane's departure.

Upon arrival at Seattle, all passengers were accounted for except a

white male using the name Dan Cooper. There were no sky marshals

aboard this flight and at no time did subject show any firearms.

From information available, the subject is described as

white male, mid 40's, 5'10" to.6', 170 to 180 pounds, average to well

built, olive or swarthy complexion, medium smooth, dark brown or

black

hair parted on left side, combed back, sideburns to low ear

level, dark eyes, probably black or brown.

Subject wore a dark suit,

white shirt, with narrow black tie. He wore dark glasses with plastic

rims (possibly prescription lenses) most of the time. He had dark

overcoat and was described as cool and calculating. His voice was

low. He spoke intelligently and was a heavy smoker of Raleigh filter

tip cigarettes.

All leads should be handled immediately and set out tele-

phonically and confirmed by teletype.. The Bureau must be kept advised

of all pertinent developments as they occur. A list of the loot is

being prepared and will' be disseminated. Consider subject dangerous.

Enclosed for each office is one artist's conception

of the captioned subject. The Bureau is preparing a circular

for field-wide circularization concerning captioned case and

will include an artist's conception of the hijacker. The Bureau

has been asked to prepare a sketch showing the unknown subject

without glasses. Additional distribution will be made from

time to time to parachute clubs, flight instruction schools and

airports, etc., in an effort to identify the unknown subject

which undoubtedly will result in various field divisions receiving

calls on this case.

For the assistance of all offices in conducting

investigation and to evaluate complaints from citizens, the

following information is furnished:

The unknown subject boarded captioned flight at

Portland, Oregon, using the name DAN COOPER. As the plane

was taxiing toward the runway, Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved for the stewardesses on the right

side of the plane and behind the last row of passenger seats.

the unknown subject, who occupied the center seat in the last

row of three seats,

turned and handed her an envelope

which she did not open for a few minutes until he glanced

at her several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said:

"Miss - I have a bomb here

and I would like you to

sit by me."

then called the pilot on the intercom.

Stewardess

then sat next to the hijacker

who opened

a black attache case and showed her what he said

was a bomb. She described the contents of the attache case

as a bundle of red sticks, which she believed was dynamite.

The bundle consisted of six or eight red colored sticks

approximately six to eight inches long with no writing on the

outside.

The hijacker was holding in his hand a wire which

lead to

the bundle of sticks-and indicated that he could

detonate the bomb by touching the wire to a contact. Also in

the attache case was a cylindrical shaped battery about eight

inches long.

At first the hijacker asked for $200,000 and, two

parachutes.

sat beside the hijacker who, after

showing the contents of the attache case, told her to,

"Take this down."

From her purse she obtained a pen and note

pad and he dictated the following message:

"I want $200,000 by 5:00 PM in cash. Put

it in a knapsack. I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes. When we land,

I want a fuel truck ready

to refuel. No funny stuff, or I'll do the job."

At the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac)

in answer to his demands, the hijacker was provided with the

four parachutes and $200,000 in 20 dollar bills in a canvas

bank bag.

When the plane landed at Seattle at 5:45 PM (PDT) ^

he instructed Stewardess

Ito go after the money

which she did. He opened the bag; inspected the money and

told them that the passengers as well'as the two other

stewardesses could leave the plane.

They did deplane.

remaining crew members were the three male members of the

flight crew as well as Stewardess

then made several trips out of the

plane to obtain the parachutes which she brought to the subject.

The hijacker instructed that he be flown to Mexico

City and also told the pilot that he wanted the plane flown at

not more than 10,000 feet with the flaps at 15 degrees, the landing

gear down and the rear steps of the plane also down.

The

plane involved was a Boeing 727, a Tri-jet with stairs at

the rear which lowered for passengers. The hijacker finally

agreed to having the steps raised and a flight plan was

arranged from Seattle to Portland and down south to Rec

Bluff, California and then to Reno, Nevada for refueling.

The plane departed Sea-Tac with the three crew

members in the cabin and

in the rear with the

hijacker. Within minutes after take off at 7:36 PM, the

hijacker had the stewardess show him how to lower the steps

and he then ordered her to go to the first class section

which she did, and she then continued on to the cabin.

At 8:05 PM the captain was in touch with the

hijacker by the intercom. This was the last communication

he had with

the hijacker. Just prior to this communication,

the captain had a signal indicating that the stairs had been

lowered.

At 8:12 PM, the captain experienced "oscillation"

in the plane and thought perhaps the hijacker had departed

the plane.

Air Force fighter planes were escorting the craft

but because the 727 was flying at 170 knots, the fighter jets

• were too fast.

Further, the weather was overcast and

visibility extremely low.

When the plane arrived at Reno, the hijacker was

gone and two of the parachutes were still in the airplane.

The attache case also was not in the plane and has not been

found.

Extensive search of the southwestern part of

Washington State, which was indicated by the 8:12 PM oscillation,

has been conducted but with negative results to date.
