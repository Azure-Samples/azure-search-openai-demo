During the Spring of the year, 1971, two white

males appeared at the Bastern Airlines Counter at La Guardia

Aixport and attempted to purchase a ticket to Miami, Florida.

The ticket agent became suspicious of the credit card used

by these men and attempted to stall them. When the two men

realized that a problem had arisen, they departed the ticket

counter leaving behind their baggage.

The property left behind by these two men became

the property of the Port Authority Police Department and was

subsequently opened and searched. Located in this baggage

were the following personnel items:

Your hijacker - A "smoke jumper" probably, whose I.D.

might be in the personnel files of District 6, U.S.D: Ag, Portland.

A person probably who had done some jumping, fits the general

description, and was seen in company of a person who claimed to

have piloted a 727 on several missions to drop "personnel and

supplies" and who had junped from a 72? "in training we all

jumped. It was a hell of a thrill," who could have inadvertently

or deliberately given the technical information. He, the pilot,

would have to have been an employe of the C.I.A. or one of its

private companies.

To have known "smoke jumpers" he might also

have flown for the USDA during fire season.

When I first saw the sketch of the hijacker, my reaction was

"I have seen that man." Then I said aloud, "impossible." But on

later recall, I believe yes - it fits the pattern.

Flight 45, Northwest 727, Monday, September 13. "The Pilot"

got on at Miles City. Stewardess put a "Seattle" pin on the back

of the seat. He did not occupy the seat after Missoula, and the

stewardess removed the pin after Sand Point.

At either Missoula ox Sand Point, four persons got on with

this "pilot," who caused quite a commotion by their identical dress.

The man directly behind me objected violently, and asked

"what the hell's going on. "

And that is when I am sure I looked

into a face similar to the one in the sketch, as he replied -

"knock it off. We each purchased one seat - and that's all you bought. "

One of the others murmured a word which I thought might be "paratroopers"

but probably was "smoke jumpers." The man apologized.

The voice was about two to three notes below normal.

Even

and pleasant. And even the words, "knock it off" had no rasp or

harshness.

The costumes were totally black. Leather or shiny plastic.

The coats hung from shoulders to knees, straight without any form

fit. The caps were a half-kepi. Instead of a bill the right edge

was twisted into an upright piece in the middle of the forehead.

All wore the type glasses in the sketch. At the hinge, the

earpiece was wide, but of a lacy pattern. No part of the eye

visible.

Iwo of them sat in the back seat left. The "pilot: said

to the others to come up front, and he would "arrange" so they could

sit together, and talk. So I got a height comparison. The pilot

about 5' 10". The next one 6' 1" or 6' 2" and slim, slim. The

' third man 5' 11" or 6', and roader.

Question-—-

I. Is there a military specialty center, or hospital at

Sand Point - fox either survival training, jumping or recuperation?

there is no Dept, of Ag. smoke jumpers camp

at Sand Point, but there are at least four in Montana and Idaho,

all of whose personnel records are at Portland.

3., I think I recall an article on smoke Jumpers, where it

described the outlandish costumes some units adopted.

4. If the C.I.A. or its companies used a 727 for personnel

drops why keep it classified information? If they have, the Chinese

intelligence would certainly have known it by now. How many pilots

or jumpers have returned to private life?

and pleasant. And even the words, "knock it off" had no rasp or

harshness.

The, costumes were totally black. Leather or shiny plastic.

The coats hung from shoulders to knees; straight without any form

fit.

The caps were a half-kepi. Instead of a bill the right edge

was twisted into an upright piece in the middle of the forehead.

All wore the type glasses in the sketch. At the hinge, the

earpiece was wide, but of a lacy pattern. No part of the eye

visible.

Two of them sat in the back seat left. The "pilot: said

to the others to come up front, and he would 'arrange" so they could

sit together,

and talk.

so I got a height comparison. The pilot

about 5' 10".

The next one 6'

The

third man 5' 11" or 6', and broader.

Questions:

Is there a military specialty center, or hospital at

Sand Point - for either survival training, jumping or recuperation?

2. I am told there is no Dept. of Ag. smoke jumpers camp

at Sand point, "but

ere are at least four in

htana and Idaho,

all of whose personnel records

are at portland.

3. I think I recall an article on Smoke Jumpers, where it

described the outlandish costumes some units adopted.

4. If the C.I.A, or its companies used a 727 for personnel

drops why keep it classified information? If they have, the Chinese

intelligence would certainly have known it by now. How many pilots

ox jumpers have returned to private life?

ground search was conducted on December 2, 1971 14 extremely wet, hazardous

and uncomfortable conditions.

I feel that the efforts of the below listed Special Agents who were

Involved in the above activity were noteworthy in that their accomplishments

were extremely productive in running down current information in a professional,

• well organized and competent manner. Their attention to detail and desire to

accomplish as much as possible in the shortest time reflects most favorably

on then as Bureau agents.

The writer wishes to coumend each of the agents

listed below for a job well done:

do you think you're doing.

I suceeded in pulling off one of the nost successful, talked about

crimes of today. Then sore guy credits himself with the masterplece and

thanks everybody, for their cooperation an hospitality.. Well Damn-it, this

is making se look very stupid. Those prank letters must stop....

No one was indangered, the caper was only committed to show the un-

belleving world that a perfect crine nas rossible. (I believe it must be

perfect since the F.B.I. are still investigating in the southern part of

Wash).

I have notified the F.B.I. asting that they grant me Amnesty.

The money will be returned.

NO HARM DONE.

SUBJECT: NORJAK

F.

W.

On 12/20/71 I talked to SAC HELD in Minneapolis.

I told him that we had made extensive efforts to search the

area where the hijacker is believed to have jumped, without

discovering any evidence of his whereabouts or identity.

The Northwest Airlines people here have advised

that they would be glad to simulate his flight, having a

man jump to see whether the crew experienced the same

reaction as recorded on the initial flight, and if the

flight recorder records the same movement of the plane.

If it did not, then it would appear that there was little use

searching in

the area we were searching in.

If it did have

the same reaction, then we would have to search an area

approximately 2½ miles by 6 miles of virgin timber.

I told SAC HELD I thought it would be well if

possible to have the same airplane used with the same crew

but I did not see any reason for them to actually jump in

the same area since it would be too dangerous and we may

lose the jumper, but I did think it wous be a good idea to

simulate it in

an area where the jumper could be recovered.

He advised he had taked to Mr. NYROP about this

and that he had instructed that the crew and plane be put

together for this purpose as soon as possible.

I inquired of him the status of their proposed

offer of a reward and he advised MI. NYROP had told him

that the Seattle P-I Secret Witness

Program had announced

a $5,000 reward, which was true, and that he would give

consideration to making another $5,000 offer for information

furnished to Northwest Airlines or

the FBI, furnishing the

identity of the hijacker and evidence to assist in his

conviction.

Aberdeen,

Washirigton, advised that the had heard that the FBI was extending its invest-

igation into the Aberdeen area in captioned natter. She was advised that

the Bureau was answering inquiries in many localities.

She reported that the evening of the hijacking, she had the television

on and was listenting to reports of the hijack while the plane was enroute Seattle

fron Portland.

While listening to this report, a helicopter flying easternly

went over her house a an unusally dow altitude.

She was unable to further identify

the aircraft, but thought it way have sorething to do with the hijacking.

Although this, in itself is of little investigative yalue, the question

arose that the unsub may have had an accomplice and was removed from the ground

after landing by aircraft.

Has the FiA and/or the suitable sonitoring agency beer

contacted for identification of all aircraft in the pertient area where the hijacker

could have landed. It has been the writer's experience to be a passenger in a

small plane south of the Codumbia River near Mount Badex Hood and hear radio

FAA Auburn report they had our plane on radar and told us exactly where we were

as well as what to expect in other aircraft passing through the area.

Upon hearing the newscasts and reading the papers

conception of the individual who perpetrated this crime.

Jadvised he believes he talked to a man who closely

resemoles the subject during July or August 1971. Basea upon

his conversation with this individual he strongly suspects

the man may be the person connected with this crime.

recalled that he talked to this man for

approximately ten to fifteen minutes concerning different

aspects of parachute jumping and during this conversation

the man asked several unusual questions. such as how would

one go about jumping out of jets.

specifically

recails telling the man it,could be done li

the door of the

aircraft opened inward or if it had a rear stairwell that

could be raised and lowered. The man appeared interested

and they discussed this further, to the point where air

speed and drag was talked about.

The fact was brought up

that full flaps and lowered landing gear would supply the

drag needed to exit from a jet.

The man also asked

where jump centers were

located in the northwest. C

Told him about three

locations In the State of Washington,

one by the Boeing

Azy frela in seattle, one on the washington side of the

Columbia River, just

north of Portland, Oregon, and the other

nished the following Information:

July or August 1973, who

believes could be identical to

the subject that hijacked the Northwest Airlines aircraft on

November 24, 1971, he recalled that the man he talked to must

have been a smoker of Raleigh Cigarettes because he observed

Raleigh coupons in the man's possession and remarked to him that

he smoked those

to buy a "?. C"igarettes with the coupons and could save enough

, meaning zara-commander type parachute, the

kind used by parachute enthusiasts and most sport jumpers.

Jadvised he recalled this while studying the

Government memorandum containing the description of the man who

hijacked the aircraft on November 24, 1971. He further advised

that he doubted that the man he talked to belonged to any para-

chute or jumping clubs inasmuch as. the average age of jumpers

is between 25 to 20 years and they would not hang around wich an

"old guy like that"

, and too because most clubs an calliornia

have disbanded in the last year and a hall.

Concerning clubs and their locations,

Washington, on November 24, 1971, and upon seeing an artists

conception of the individual who

advised he believes ne talked to a man who closely

resembles the subject during July or August 1971. Based upon

his conversation with this individual he strongly suspects

the man may be the person connected with this crime.

recalled that he talked to this man for

approximately ten to fifteen minutes concerning different

aspects of parachute jumping and during this conversation

the man asked several unusual questions. such as how would

one go about jumping out of jets.

specifically

recalls telling the man it could be done it the door of the.

aircraft opened inward or if it had a rear stairwell that

could be raised and lowerea.

The man appeared interested

and they discussed this further, to the point where air

speed and drag was talked about.

The fact was brought up

that full flaps and lowered landing gear would supply the

drag needed to exit from a jet.

The man also asked

where jump centers were

located in the northwest.

'one by the Boeing

Air field in seattle, one on the Washington side of the

In addition, they discussed altitude of Jumps, but

who was thinking in terms of altitude records, answered

in terms, implying world record altitudes, oxygen supplys time

and distance of free fall.

also recalled the individual rather vividly

in his mind because he wore

"Cochrane "boots. He explained that

Cochrane boots are peculiar to military jumpers and are not

worn by teans, clubs, sport or novice.

He stated that serious

Jumpers wear a French boot and first time jumpers have zone with

sureet shoes, tennis shoes, sandals and even baretooted, but

the cochrane boots were noticable because they are not used by

too many people. ...

He also stated he belleved the man may have jumped

on several occasions at the Elsinore center. If he did. there

would be a registration card. on file with

elsinore paricenter, inc. He advised that

each person that jumps must fill out a registration card before

jumping, regardless of how much prior experience the person has

had elsewere.

These cards are maintained at Elsinore Paricenter.

'On succeeding jumps,

, the cards are referred to if the individual

1s not known, and a receipt for jump tickets is given to the

jumper with no name or further recording of the jump being made.

An individual with prior experience and a license issued by the

United States Parachute Association (USPA) would have the USPA

Iscense number written on the registration cara.

concerning the individual he talked to sometime during

udy of August 1971, who

believes could be identical to

the subject that hijacked the Northwest Airlines aircraft on

November 24, 1971, he recalled that the man he talked to must

have been a smoker of Raleigh Cigarettes because he observed.

Raleigh coupons in the man's possession and remarked to him that

he smoked

those

to buy a "p. C.

"cigarettes with the coupons and could save enough

, meaning Para-Commander type parachute, the

kind used by parachute enthuslasts and most sport jumpers.

advised he recalled this while studying the

Government memorandum containing the description of the man who

hijacked the aircraft on November 24, 1971. He further advised

that he doubted that the man he talked to belonged to any para-

chute or jumping clubs inasmuch as the average age of jumpers

Is between 25 to 28 years and they would not hang around with an

"old guy like that"

, and too because most clubs in California

have disbanded in the last year and a half.

Concerning clubs and their locations,

advised

that they could be identified through the U. S. Parachute Asso-

ciation which prints a brochure with the clubs in alphabetical

Northwest Airlines, called and advised he

would arrive in Seattle at 12:40 PM on 12/28/71,

on Northwest Airlines Flight $15 so that he may confer

with Agents of this office in order to plan for the

simulated flight during the week of 1/3/72.

He then called later and asked if it is

possible to determine the identity of the person who

drew up the flight chart map from MeChord AFB so that

he can discuss with them the time schedule and minute

variations and locations of the flight at given times

during the night.

I contacted SA OLROG and told him to obtain

this information and let me know so

I certainly hope I can be of some help in finding this

sky pirate, although this is just a hunch!

I am sure you remember when those gas station attendants

were killed...executed. I was in my late teens then and read

about that horrible episode. I called the Seattle Police

Station, I am sure it was, and told them I realized that all

those men killed. had last names that had four letters in them

and they all had a meaning in every day life. For instance,

others

Fair was one of the names. I do not remember the offers off

hand. Now this was just a hunch but it was in the papers the

next day as being a possibility that the killers worked this way

for some weird reason.

As for the guy who parachuted out of the plane with

$200,000 and gave a name as D. B. Cooper---that's hardly his

real name---i think he may have used a name that is part of his

real name, like Cooper Beatty, which could be possible. He

is a sort of clever fellow, he appeared calm and did not seem.

to have a care in the world, according to passengers. It could'

be cooper Beatty is another alias--but ,maybe not. He may be

laughing up his sleeve, thinking he pulled this off, just

because the authorities did not think of, such a simple thing

as reversing his name---reversing the last name with the first

two initials.

With regard to the recent hijacking of a plane involving

My son. has a friend who drops. by the house occasionally.

One evening about a week ago the friend came by and, in the

process of the conversation, he mentioned that he was going to

have a $200,000 wedding. Jokingly I asked if by some chance

he was in on the hijacking of the airplane. His answer was

yes, and my uncle who lives in the vicinity of Vancouver,

Washington, even looks like the hijacker and even owns a

Cessna 310, is an ex-paratrooper and does sky diving.

In regards to "D. B. Cooper" who hijacked the North-

west Orient Airlines 727 on the night of November 24, 1971,

I have the following information:

There is a man named

who works as

Oregon. The man fits the

physical description and wears dark glasses most of the time.

After the time of the hijacking he has become very much less

sociable. The man's history has been somewhat unstable as

far as employment, which includes work in a bank. The above

information is hearsay but was convincing enough to be very

believable in addition to other information I cannot ac-

He noted that he

has heard that the parachutes furnished to the man were a.

commercial brand-named Up roneer and-a-now surplus-Navya

parachute designated "NB-8", He stated if this is a fact,

he doubts the man is a sky diver inasmuch as anyone with

sky-diving experience would have asked for a sky-diving

type parachute, which neither of the above are.

further advised that the above parachutes

would be hazardous to use inasmuch as that type of chute

would open very quickly, with a possibility of tearing,

and both have a high rate of descent and very limited

control. In his opinion, 'a person using such a chute would

probably have prior military jumping experience. but would

not have sky-diving experience.

He further noted that an

exper ences say aver would have asked for a chute such as

a "Páre-Comer

ider!, which would be readily avartable in' an

area such as Seattle, Washington. This type of parachute

opens more slowly, is very maneuverable, and has a much

slower rate of descent.

commercial brand named "Pioneer" and a now surplus Navy

parachute designated "NB-8", He stated if this 1s a fact,

he doubts the man is a iky diver inasmuch as anyone with

sky-diving experience would have asked for a sky-diving

type parachute, which neither of the above are.

further advised that the above paradates

would be hazardous to use inasmuch as that type of chute

would open very quickly, with a possibility of tearing,

and both have a high rate of descent and very limited

control. In his opinion, a person using such a chute would

probably have prior military jumping experience but would

not have sky-diving experience. He further noted that an

experienced sky diver would have asked for a chute such as

a "Para-Commander"

, which would be readily available in an

area such as Seattle, Washington. This type of parachute

opens more slowly, is very maneuverable, and has a much

slower rate of descent.
