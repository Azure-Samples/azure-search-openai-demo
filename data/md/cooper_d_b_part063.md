years in river

nine miles northwest of Vancouver,

Wash., where a family building a camp-

fire found three packets of badly deteri-

orated $20 bills.

The FBI said the money, believed; to

be several thousand dollars, was part of

the $200,000 ransom paid to a man

known only as Dan Cooper. Cooper,

popularly known as "D.B. Cooper" be-

cause of an croneous news agency re-

port at the time, received the money

after hijacking a Northwest Airlines jet-

liner after it departed from •Portland

Nov. 24, 1971.

Palmer's research discounted an ini-

tial FBI theory that the cash had been

deposited on the river bank during a

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers channel-

dredging operation in 1974. Palmer said

there were two other distinct layers of

sand and sediment on top of the materi-,

al dredged from the river

The money was found in a layer of

coarse sand ranging from several inches

to 4 feet thick, Palmer said. He said the

top layer of sand probably was deposit-

ed by wave action caused by passing

ships.

Palmer sald he believed the money

found its way into the water not long

r after the hijacking, because it would

have deteriorated within weeks if left

exposed on the surface.

Palmer offered a theory for what

happened, based on what little evidence

exists and on geological information. It

bills and three parachutes.

FBI agents believed he left the plane, during a

storm, about 20 miles northeast of where the crumbled

and weathered bills were found.

It is the nation's only unsolved hijacking.

"We'll work today and tomorrow and probably knock s

it off and bring my troops back up here and reassess the

*situation," said Jack Pringie, assistant agent In charge

fol the Seattle office which took over the search

*operations.

"Some of the area is inaccessible and there's no way

we can search the whole river," Pringle said.

*. • He said geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State

University concluded that the dredging operation in 1974

did not put the money onto the beach, because the bills

were lound above clay deposits put on the banks by the

dredge.

Brian Ingram, when scooping out a place for 'a

campfire,

found the money, tied together by rubber

bands in three clumps, under a thin layer of sand.

The bills were matched to the Cooper loot by serial

numbers.

HOW HE FOILED FBI

Last Norember?4th, a man Identitying himself as

'D.B. Cooper' parachutedtrom a Northwest Orient

slines.727 jetliner between Seatle and Reno Nevada

ith a parcel containing 10,000 twenty dollar bulls which

was the ransommoney that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattle-

Tacoma international airport.

The F.B.I. and other state and local law enforcement

ageats assisted by companies of G.L's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payers dollars looking for cooper.

So far Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same ingenious manner that he pulied off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

danger.

The F.B.I. headquaters" in Seattle has vowed to scr-

utinize every foot of land between the Sea-Tac airport

and Reno to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias "

Fink on your Friends" programe the public has generally

granted Cooper adoration and somewhat a hero status.

An ancaymous interviewer from the twice weekly

spaper the 'Seatlle Flag' has produced a story from

caped interview with D.B, Cooper which is validated

by the, presentation of one of the recorded twenty dollar

bills Included in the ransom money,

This story was run in the 'Flag' because the inter-

viewer was unable to send it to the 'Post-Intellingener'

because they had the 5,000 dollar reward out for Coopers

head also television stations would have requested a tape

from which voice prints could possible be produced.

Therefore, running the story in the Flag was the only.:

solution.

Cooper said that the witnesses description were off

by about tilteen pounds and a couple of inches. Also that

the artist's impression were very poor. When asked way.

Cooper book could

blend fact, fantasy

OOK FOR a book or two on D.B. Cooper to show up in

L the next few weeks or months.

A news source claims a writer has secured documents

on the case from the FBI through the Freedom of In-

formation Act and hopes to weave a tale out of the sky-

jacking that has kept people wondering for 8½ years.

It wouldn't be surprising to see more than one author

try to cash in on the recently rekindled publicity about

the incident. Cashing in like that seems to be more in

vogue these days than it was in 1971, when Cooper disap-

peared..

Authors of those kinds of books often report theory and

supposition as well as fact. Sometimes it's hard to tell the

difference between what the writers know and what they

think or assume.

• Some authors make no bones about mixing fact and

fantasy. Take .44, the semifiction book about the Son of

Sam murders in New York by Jimmy Breslin and Dick

Schaap. Brestin and Schaap admit in the foreword to the

book that they changed the names of the characters and

the sequence of events, and embellished on the story.

They graphically detailed what their deranged killer

was thinking about, for example, but it was obviousiy

what the authors thought the killer was thinking. Of

course, it added greatly to the drama of the book.

Breslin and Schaap said the embellishmont was

legitimate because they wanted to recreate the di-

mosphere of the murders, to portray in fiction, the gut-

level realism of the erimes..-miéedoine

Alfhough the skyjacking was hardly as heinous a trime

as a New York murder spree, that mixture of fact and

fantasy might be what you'll see in the D.B. Cooper book,

assuming there indeed is one in the making. The Cooper

author would have an easy time cooking up a tale of

where the hijacker came from and what happened to

him, and the story could be quite readable.

It he has any trouble making up a story about who

Cooper was or what happened to him, he could look piles

of newspaper clippings that report on different people's

theories on the subject. But with all the leads the FBI

says it has tracked down, there can hardly be a lack of

ideas about Cooper's fate.

As far as distinguishing fact from fantasy, we hope the

newspapers have done their duty in labeling theories as

what they are. It would be nice if any books on the matter

did the same.

We probably can't take the word of anybody but Cooper

Finder of Cooper loot

gets frayed $20 bill

VANCOUVER, Wash. = Eight-

year-old Brian Ingram, who found bun-

dies of $20 bilis last week but had to

turn them over to authorities, has been

given one by the FBI.

The boy jumped into the national

spotlight Feb. 10 when he'discovered

several thousand dollars of the $200,000

ransom paid to skyjacker Dan Cooper in

1971. The money, frayed around the

edges, was identified by FBI agents

who have been looking for Cooper since :

he jumped from a Northwest Orient

Airlines plane over Southwest Wash-'

ington.

The $20 was given to the boy by

Mike Heywood,

Hough Elementary

School PTA president. Accompanying

the bill was a certificate praising the

boy for his find.

Since finding the money, Brian and

his parents, H. Dwayne and Patricia,

have been the subject of network televi-:

Sion newscasts and newspaper articles.

Saturday night, the three were satirized

on the

"Weekend Update" segment of

the weekly televisiony show "Saturday.

Night Live.",

Geologist's finding

A thorough search of a Columbia River beach where part of D:B.

Cooper's ransom money was found Sunday has turned up no new

clues as to the fate of the legendary skyjacker.

day, then probably be suspended temporarily.

Brought to the beach to aid in Wednesday's search were

backhoe and a geologist.

The FBI said the backhoe was used to dig a trench near the

discovery site, making possible a study of the layers to sand.

An associate professor of geology at Portland State University,

Leonard Palmer, was retained to inspect the sand and to assist in-

vestigators in determining when the bundled money may have been

deposited there.

Palmer, to the surprise of some authorities, concluded that the

money was deposited on the beach in the past year or two because it

Was above clay deposits put on the beach in a 1974 channel dredging

operation.

Accordine to the FBI, a coarse laver of sand sloped from a height

of about six inches at the river's edge to two feet or more some

distance up the river bank.

i Earlier, Ralph Himmelsbach, a Portland FBI agent who has had

charge of following new leads in the Cooper case for a number of

years, said he believed the money must have been deposited within

a couple of years aiter the skyjacking.

He says discovery of the money provided a major break in the •

case, but puts authorities no closer to locating Cooper, whom Him-

melsbach believes is dead.

Idents say the money was tied to Cooper when he bailed out of

he plane, but was no longer with him when it was deposited on thei

beach.

Il it had still been attached to his body at the bottom of the river"

when the channel was dredged in 1974, the body would have clogged

up the dredge and have been found, agents believe.

Jack Pringle, assistant agent in charge of the Seattle FBI Office,

told The Daily News this morning that small bits and pieces of $20

bills were located Wednesday when agents continued digging in

sand surrounding the spot where a Vancouver family discovered

money Sunday.

The Harold Dwayne Ingram family was on an outing north and

awest of Vancouver when their 8-year-old son, Brian, uncovered

several thousand dollars in decomposed bills.

Ingram contacted the Portland FBI Office, and a check of serial

numbers conclusively established that the

money was part of

$200,000 in $20 bills Cooper had when he bailed out of a Northwest.

Orient Airlines jet over the Lewis River area on Nov. 21, 1971.

Pringle Said the area was still being searched today, but no nevil

evidence had been located as of this forenoon.

"Some of the arca is inaccessible, and there's no way we can

search the whole area, Pringle said in Seattle this morning:.

The weathered bundles of $20 bills

Columbia River nine miles northwest of

Vancouver on Sunday were the first

solid ciues to the mystery of the "Dan

Cooper" aircraft hijacking, FBI agents

One of the more intensive searches

in the FBI's history had failed to turn up

any clue to the fate of the mysterious

hijacker or his loot during the eight

years since he bailed out of a Northwest

Orient Airlines Boeing 727 fiying at

7,000 feet over La Center, Wash., on

rNov. 21, 1971, FBI spokesmen said.

Cooper's was the first hijacking of a

commercial airliner for money, and

started a chain of simitar attempts,

• which was responsible in part for the

rigid security system now enforced at

all United States airports and most ma-

jor airports abroad.

Because of an erroneous report of

the name used by the hijacker, he be-

although the airline manifest showed he

the rear door had been opened. Later •

tests showed this was when the hijack.;

er had bailed out, taking with him the

money and the device that he claimed

was a bomb.

Computer calculations and a later

reconstruction of the flight persuaded

Woodland, Wash, and would haye:

Reno, Nev., at 11 p.m.

The "target area" was searched rel

peatedly by the FBI, other law enforce-

ment officers and soldiers from Forf.

Lewis, Wash., but no trace of man or

money was found. Northwest Airlines

offered a reward, since expired, and

hunters and woodsmen continued the

search for years without success.

The man who called himself Cooper

paid cash for a ticket and boarded

Beach residents

groan

By Donna duBeth

The Dally News

The handful of residents who live along the beach

where part of D.B. Cooper's loot was found Sunday

are kicking themselves for not building more sand

They also wonder whether they should have paid

more attention to the sand dredging operations along

Tina Bar is a stretch of sandy beach on the

Washington side of the Columbia River northwest of

Vancouver. The lonely country road that winds along

the beach, Lower River Road, dead-ends about three

miles from where a Vancouver family found about

$3,000 beneath the sand Sunday while on a picnic.

Rabbits bounce on the side of the road at night, startl-

• ed by occasional passing cars.

Less than 10 houses are along the 12-mile stretch of

beach road. Host of the land belongs to large dairy

farms. The Fazio Bros. Sand Co. also fronts the river.

A road leading through the Fazio gate is a popular

path to the beach. It is the same path used by the

family the day they found the money. On the east side

of Fazio Bros. is Leeward Isle Marina, with a public

fishing boat launch and one or two house boats.

During fishing season, the beach is packed from

end to end, say local residents Clarence and Barbara

Dilis. They have lived in their mobile home just down

› the road from Fazio Bros. for the past 30 ycars.

Every day Clarence takes his outboard skiff along

rina Bar patrulling the river and the beach for

renegade logs that could damage other boats.

Ellis says that the Army Corps of Engineers con-

tinuously dredges sand directly off the shore from

where the money was found.

"I betcha that dredging brought that money up and

they were working closely with the FBI, checking out

that lead. The sand sucked up from the bottom of the

river and spewed onto the beach could have contain-

ed some or all of the long-sought money. While the

deposited in that spot was in October 1974.

Another resident of the area said that the money

was found too far irom the water to have washed up.

"It had to be the dredging. Maybe I'll go gel me a

shovel," said Mrs. J.W. Frceman.

The FBI dug all day Tuesday, finding bits and

pieces of $20 bills. An agent guarding the site Tuesday

evening said the amount they found during the day.

was less than the $3.000 orginally dug up.

Tuesday night the Eltis family sat in their home

decorated with fishing gear and large plants, amazed

that some the D.B. Cooper money was snowing up on

the same beach their children grew up on.

"To think I worked like a slave all my life and here

this money was right in my front yard," said Ellis.

"When I think of the times my kids took the four-

His wife, Barbara, said she felt "kinda sick" not

finding it. But she added that she would have turned it

How it all

started

On Nov. 24, 1971, a calm,

middle-age

man

calling

himself Dan Cooper bought a

ticket for a Northwest Airlines

flight to Seattle.

Shortly after takeoff,

he

handed a note to stewardess

Florence Schaffner.

Thinking the man was try-

ing to "hustle" her, she stuff-

ed the note in her purse, but he

motioned for her to read it.

The note said he had a

bomb, and wanted to go to

Mexico.

While the jet circled Seattle

before landing, the skyjacker

also ordered that $200,000 cash

and

four

parachutes be

brought to the plane.

The airline agreed, 36

passengers and part of the

crew were allowed to leave,

and the plane took off with the

,man and his ransom.

As it flew south, the rear

airstair was

lowered,

and

minutes later the plane

treacted in a manner that con-

vinced the crew that the sky-

jacker had

bailed

out

somewhere in

the

Lewis

River-Lake Merwin area east

of Woodland.

Thus began the legend of

D.B. Cooper (the name Dan

Cooper somehow got lost in

news media accounts of the in-

cident.)

Cooper has never

been

found, but interest in the case

is still strong, and flared Tues-

day when the FBI announced

a Vancouver family had found

1 several thousand dollars of the )

ransom money on a Columbia:

River beach northwest of Van-

couver.

Several stories

about the

case appear in today's issue of 1

Enclosed for the Bureau are two copies of an agreement

has been

in contact with the Seattle

He states he has done considerable

research in connection with an individual whom he feels is a

suspect in captioned hijacking and has a book which he has pre-

pared concerning this.

He has obtained fingerprints of this

individual and desires to furnish them to the FBI for comparison,

with latent fingerprints which were located in the aircraft

following captioned hijacking. It should be noted that there

were some latent fingerprints as well as palm prints located in.

the aircraft.

It has been explained to

that he can make available

to the FBI, the fingerprints which

he

has and that a comparison

will be made and he will be advised of the results. He states,

however, that on advice of his attorney, he does not desire to

make these fingerprints available until

the FBI has signed an

agreement with him that they will not prevent him from publishing

his book.

It has been explained that the FBI will in no way inter-

fer with the publication of his book and that obviously an

Re telephone call to ASAC

Exon Representative secluskey, california.

on 4/22/80,

Referenced telephone call was made by an Aid to

Congressman McCluskey of California, who requested the name,

composer, and lyrics to a song referred to as "The Ballad

of D. B. Cooper".

This inquiry was made pursuant to a

constituent's inquiry and was referred to this office,

specifically ASAC

by the Portland Division.

A review of Seattle files, indicate the following

references: In Seattle file 164-81-SubB, Vol. I, newspaper

clipping dated 11/23/72, final edition of the Seattle Post

Intelligencer, Seattle, Washington, page Al8, written by

Eldon Barrett, reports that a Portland nightclub singer,

Tom Bresh, wrote and recorded a short lived success record

entitled "D. B. Cooper, Where Are You?". Additionally, in

the same file, a Seattle Post Intelligencer article written

by Dick Clever, appearing on 11/23/72, in the final edition,

at page Al9, there appears an article penned by Clever and

copyrighted story, the copyright is held by the Seattle Post

Intelligencer, dated 1972, entitled "A Ballad to the Man

Called D. B. "

That story and the words in their entirety are:

"He was cool, he was calm, the man with the "bomb", who

boarded flight 36 with ease.

And pilot Bill Scott, not

suspecting the plot, took off with the man called D. B.

They were just in the air, when

the stew caught the

stare,

of the man in the back of the plane.

He passed her a paper,

which he thought shead the notte", she thought him a flirt

and quite vain.

his wave told, and she

thought him quite bola, to make such a pass in mid flight.

But she did

as he asked, and she read

and she gasped, as the

jet flew on into the night.

"I hate to think the thoughts people will be

thinking

about

me

over the United

States," said Harold Dwayne Ingram as he

sat in his boss's office Thursday afternoon.

The 28-year-old Vancouver resident said he

now regrets his 8-year-old son.Brian's finding

of D.B. Cooper's hijack ransom money last

"I regret it for myself, but not for Brian,"

who, he said, has enjoyed all the attention.

Brian and his family made national

headlines after a family outing on

Columbia River beach near Vancouver Feb.

10 turned into a major media and FBI event.

Brian was preparing a campfire when he

scooped out about $5,000 of the $200,000

Cooper had demanded and received before

jumping out of an airliner in 1971.

Since last month Ingram has:

© Lost 1½ days pay - about $100 - in

order to return the money and attend an FBI

press conference.

• Watched as a fire caused about $1,000

damage to the woper floor of his home at

* 1500 Markle St. Saturday.

• Been arrested Monday on an Oklahoma

warrant alleging he left that state unlawfully

with mortgaged property * a car.

Officials in Oklahoma said they recognized

Ingram

from newspaper photographs that

appeared after the famous find, ingram had

been wanted for about six months before the

story first appeared in the paper, they said.

The warrant was issued because Ingram

allegedly is behind in payments for his car.

every receipt," Ingram

Thursday. "I don't have a payment due on

that car until the 20th of next month."

"I fecl confused, really confused," Ingram

said Thursday.

"And I feel pretty unlucky.

I'm not angry; I'm kind of hurt. I really care

what people think about me."

Ingram said he bought his car from a new

car salesman, paid $200 or $300 down, and

arranged for financing. He said he notified

the finance company when he and his family

moved here from Oklahoma last winter.

His arrest Monday

was an unhappy

surprise, he said.

"I had no idea I had a warrant on me," he

"That's obvious,

or I wouldn't be

flashing my face all over the world."

164-81-8318

Last Novemberz4th,

a man identitying himself as

¿ Cooper" parachutedirom a Northwest Orient

ines. 727 jetliner between Seattle and Reno Nevada

with a parcel contalning 10,000 twenty dollar bills which

was the ransommoney that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattle-

Tacora International airport.

The F.B.L. and other state and local law enforcement

agents assisted by companies of G.L's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payers dollars looking for cooper.

So lar Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same ingenious manner that he pulled off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

danger.

The F.B.L headquaters" in Seattle has vowed to ser-

utinize every foot of land between the Sea-Tac airport

and Reno to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias "

Fink on your Friends" programe the public has generally

granted Cooper adoration and somewhat a hero status.

anoayinous interviewer from the twice weekly

newspaper the 'Seattle Flag' has produced a story from

a taped interview with D.B. Cooper which is validated

by tie, presentation of one of the recorded twenty dollar

bills included in the ransom money,

This story was run in the 'Flag' because the inter-

viewer was unable to send it to the 'Post-Intellingener'

because they had the 5.000 dollar reward out for Coopers

head also television stations would have requested a tape

• from which voice prints could possible be produced.'

Therefore," running the story in the Flag was the only

solution.

Cooper said that the witnesses description were off

by about fifteen pounds and a couple of inches. Also that

the artist's impression were very poor. Whea asked why

sit was saler to hide where no one would imagine him to

it was a

calculated risk that's why he jumped in bad

weather and at night, also he waited a little longer than

usual before pulling his ripcord. Adding that his free

fall was about 5,000 of the total 7,000 feet, Which was very

risky doing at night.

He came down about a hundred miles away from S.W..

Washington contrary to the F.B.I. report that he touched

down near Vancouver Washington.

The first thing he did on landing was bury his chute,:

: he was within five miles of shere he had intended in an

evergreen wooded terrain. He credited this accuracy

to his projected calculations and his japanese watch.

He wouldn't say whether he had an accomplice on the.

ground. He said he had lived in Seattle and had once'

Title:

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

Cooper book cöuld

blend fact, fantasy

OOK FOR a book or two on D.B. Cooper to show up in

IL the next few weeks or months.

A news source claims a writer has secured documents

on the case from the FBI through the Freedom of In-

formation Act and hopes to weave a tale out of the sky-

jacking that has kept people wondering for 8½ years.

It wouldn't be surprising to see more than one author

try to cash in on the recently rekindled publicity about

the incident. Cashing in like that seems to be more in

vogue these days than it was in 1971, when Cooper disap-

peared.,

Authors of those kinds of books often report theory and

supposition as well as fact. Sometimes it's hard to tell the

difference between what the writers know and what they

'think or assume.

• Some authors make no bones about mixing fact and

fantasy. Take 11, the semifiction book about the Son of

Sam murders in New York by Jimmy Breslin and Dick

Schaap. Breslin and Schaap admit in the foreword to the

book that they changed the names of the characters and

the sequence of events, and embellished on the story.

• They graphically detailed what their deranged killer

was thinking about, for example, but it was obviously

What the authors thought the killer was thinking. Of

course, it added greatly to the drama of the book.

-Breslin

and Schaap said the embellishment

WaS

legitimate because they wanted to recreate the

ăt-

mosphere of the murders, to portray in fiction the gut-

level realism of the crimes. i cateria

SUBS: B,4

Although the skyjacking was hardly as heinous a trime

as a New York murder spree, that mixture of fact and

fantasy might be what you'll see in the D.B. Cooper boon,

assuming there indeed is one in the making. The Cooper

author would have an easy time cooking up a tale of

where the hijacker came from and what happened to

him, and the story could be quite readable.

If he has any trouble making up a story about who

Cooper was or what happened to him, he could look piles

of newspaper clippings that report on different people's

theories on the subject. But with all the leads the FBI

says it has tracked down, there can hardly be a lack of

ideas about Cooper's fate.

As far as distinguishing fact from fantasy, we hope the

newspapers have done their duty in labeling theories as

what they are. It would be nice if any books on the matter

did the same.

We probably can't take the word of anybody but Cooper

himself on what actually took place. Bub although

Finder of Cooper loot

gets frayed $20 bill

VANCOUVER, Wash. ÷ Eight-

year-old Brian ingram, who found bun-

dies of $20 bills last week but had to

turn them over to authorities, has been

given one by the FBI.

The boy jumped into the national

spotlight Feb. 10 when he discovered

several thousand dollars of the $200,000

ransom paid to skyjacker Dan Cooper in

1971. The money, frayed around the

edges, was identified by FBI agents

who have been looking for Cooper since :

he jumped from a Northwest Orient

Airlines plane over Southwest Wash-

ington.

The $20 was given to the boy by

Mike Heywood,

Hough

Elementary

School PTA president. Accompanying

the bill was a certificate praising the

boy for his find.

Since finding the money, Brian and

his parents, H. Dwayne and Patricia,.

have been the subject of network televi

sion newscasts and newspaper articles.

Saturday night, the three were satirized

on the

"Weekend Unidate" segment of

the weekly television, show "Saturday.

The Bureau has instructed that whenever an inquiry is

received from a newsman, whether or not this particular

reporter has or has not written favorable or unfavorable

articles about the Bureau, he should be treated as courteously

as possible.

Naturally, if the person is inquiring about

policy matters, the inquiry should be referred to the SAC,

or in his absence, the ASAC.

With regard to matters pertaining to pending inves-

tigations, future arrests or major cases, there appears to be

some confusion, therefore, for the purpose of clarification,

I would like to point out the following:

Routine inquiries in Headquarters City should

be directed to SA

(News Media Representative

for this Division), and in his absence the SAC or ASAC.

Routine inquiries at Resident Agencies are to

be handled by the Senior Resident Agent unless it is a case

Whenever a case Agent has an investigation of

any consequence or a major incident occurs, i.e. shooting,

arrest of well-known figure, it is his responsibility to

promptly notify the SAC, ASAC, and SAL

in order that

all inquiries can be properly handled.

The case Agent should

not hesitate to notify the above, even though the incident

occurs over weekends, holidays, or after normal working hours.

4.

Case Agents are not to offer opinions, state-

ments, or speculations about cases when they are approached

by members of the press during or after investigations.

out that the D. B. COOPER case is receiving a great deal of

publicity because of the approaching anniversary date of the

hijacking. In order that the FBI can speak in "one" voice

about this case, it is important that all press inguiries be

referred

to headquarters.

This is to

avoid inconsistencies

as individual Agents speculating about what might have

happened in the COOPER case and these inconsistencies being

pointed out by the members of the media.

I again want to point out that the FBI's policy with

the press has been established by the Director and has been

approved by the Attorney General. This policy is general in

nature and common sense

should dictate in most instances

how a

particular incident should be handled; however, the above

guidelines are being reiterated at this time.

If there is any

doubt in your mind about how to handle a particular situation,

it should be resolved in favor of immediately notifying the

SAC, ASAC, or news media representative.

HUNT STILL ON FOR D. B. COOPER

The fact that the hunt is still on for

the skyjacker known as D. B. Cooper

whose story was told in the August

Issue of MISSING, became apparent

recently when Jerry A. Cooper, 3

Virginia man, learned he was being

investigated by the FBI as possibly

being the mystery man.

It is not surprising that Jerry Cooper

was suspected of being the skyjacker.

Jerry, a 30-year-old heavy equipment

operator, was a sport skydiver for

about eight years until he gave it up

five years ago. And at one time he

worked

as a fueler at Washington

National Airport where the hijacked

Northwest flight originated four years

ago.

"You come right down to it, the guy is

almost the same as me. The same

weight,

same height,

same com-

plexion." Jerry said when interviewed

by reporters.

"You put glasses on that

man and look at me four years ago and

you're pretty

close.

My hair was

shorter then. The ears are the same.

It's scary."

The skyjacker who bailed out of the

Northwest 727 somewhere between

Seattle and Reno on the night of

November 24, 1971, was described by

witnesses as being about six fect tall,

180 pounds with dark hair and com-

plexion.

He was thougit to be bet-

ween forty and fifty years old, but

the resemblance is startling as shown

in the photographs below,

At last report, the FBI was still inves-

tigating Jerry Cooper's whereabouts

on that wednesday, tour, years ago,

but Michael A. Morrow, the assistant

special FBI agent in charge of the

Alexandria, Virginia office said, "We

feel very certain that he isn't D. B.

Cooper, but unti we are one hundred

per cent sure we'll keep checking"*

Jerry's comment was, "D. B. Cooper,

come out of liding and

get me out of,

this!"

dollar bills delivered to him at Seattle

in a laundry sack along with two sets

of parachutes. Otherwise he would

blow up the plane.

According to Bill Hawkes, assis-

tant chief in the Seattle-Tacoma Air-

port Tower, the first indication they

had of the trouble was when the cap-

tain radioed he had "a little trouble

in the cockpit." While the plane

circled Seattle for two and one-half

hours, the $200,000 in twenty-dollar

bills was collected from several

Seattle banks and the parachutes

were obtained from nearby McCord

Air Force Base. The hijacker refused

to let the

plane land until

the money, the

parachutes and

a fuel truck were

ready and waiting.

Newspaper accounts say

that during this time

Captain Scott

negotiated

with the hi-

jacker. But

from later

reports it seems evident/that there

was little negotiation on Cooper's

part. He wanted the money, the para-

chutes, and transportation to Mexico.

When these were ready and waiting

he would allow the airplane to land

and park in a remote section of the

airport to be refueled. Then, when

the money was on board, the passen-

gers and two of the stewardesses

could deplane; after which, they

would depart immediately.

Captain Scott apparently did not

alarm his passengers. Later Assistant

U. S. Attorney Larry Finegold, one

of the passengers, told newsmen that

they were informed by the crew that

there were some minor difficulties.

"Then we saw they were dumping

gas and I thought there was some

landing gear problem.' Finegold said.

"After we landed, I saw this gas truck

drive up and I thought to myself,

Why don't they get us off first?" i

then saw the money bag being handed

over and I realized that there had

been a hijack."

The plane was parked in a remote

section of the airport and the pas-

sengers were required to walk a dis-

tance to a bus since the hijacker

wouldn't allow the vehicle near the

aircraft. Landings and takeoffs were

delayed while the passengers walked

across the runway to the waiting bus.

Route of Flight Selected by

the Captain

Reports are

a little vague about

the sequence of events but the FBI

firmly states that Cooper's requested

destination was Mexico City. When

he was told by Captain Scott that the

plane could not fly there without

refueling, the hijacker suggested a

stop at Yuma, Arizona. The Captain's

reply was that even Yuma was beyond

the range of the 727, but that he could

safely make Reno, Nevada. Cooper

apparently agreed to this

destination

but twenty minutes after departure

the Captain became aware that

Cooper was extending the stairs.

"Anything we can do for you?" the

Captain called back over the plane's

interphone.

There was no answer but a few

seconds later another light flashed in

the cockpit indicating the ramp was

fully extended. Then Cooper came

on the interphone and answered a

brief, "No." That was the last that

was heard from him.

fallen snow made it virtually

impassable.

The search resumed on Friday, but

by now police doubted that Cooper

could have survived.

"We're either looking for a para-

chute or a hole in the ground," Under-

Sheriff Tom McDowell of Clark

County was quoted as saying. After

a week the search was called off.

Then, late in March, 1972, 300

soldiers from Ft. Lewis searched the

thawing terrain for 18 days. They

found no traces of Cooper although

they did find a body and cleared up a

local murder.

What happened to him? And what

happened to the bag of money which

was reported to be 6"x8"x27" and

weigh 24½ pounds?

Four Theories

While there has been much specu-

lation all theories fall into one of four

basic categorys:

:

(1) He bailed out where the FBI

thinks he did and got away before the

search started.

(2) He bailed out where the FBI

thinks he did and is still there, hung

in some remote tree or possibly at

the bottom of Lake Merwin.

(3) He bailed out elsewhere and

got away.

(4) He bailed out elsewhere and

did not survive.

Let's examine each of these in turn.

No one seems to give much

credence to the first theory. If FBI

agent Harrington's statement is cor-

rect and the search was started im-

mediately after the plane passed over

the area, Cooper could hardly have

landed, hidden his parachutes (or

taken them with him) and gotten out

of the area with his bag of money

without attracting attention. It was

raining and even if he was lucky

enough to come down on a paved

road, he could not have hitched a

ride without the incident being re-

ported. And what did he do with the

parachutes? Could he have had a car

or an accomplice with a car waiting

for him? This is a good possibility,

but if he did, how did he know exactly

when and where to jump to meet

this accomplice in time to get away

before the hunt started? While he did

not specify the route of the flight the

plane was to take, it is possible that

he knew that for the airliner to fly to

Mexico City, Yuma or Reno, at an

altitude of 10,000 feet, it would have

to take the airway it did, at least as

far as Portland. And it is possible that

he could estimate their position by

knowing the amount of time it would

take them to fly to that point from

Seattle at the speed of two hundred

miles an hour. But even at 200 miles

an hour, the plane was traveling at

better than three miles a minute. To

do all these things and then be lucky

enough to land close enough to his

planned point of landing in that

weather to get away, money, para-

chutes and all, before the search

started would indeed be incredible.

Another point against this theory

is the absense of the parachutes. If

he did indeed come down in a planned

spot and have transportation nearby,

it would seem he would leave the

parachutes. He had no further need

for them and he certainly wouldn't

carry them if he had to walk any dis-

tance or had to hitch a ride out.

Theory number two is a little more

likely than number one, but never-

the-less seems to have been abon-

doned. From all reports, the searches

that were made, both at the time im-

thorough. Still the possibility re

that the body, the money and all are

still there either in a tree or in the

lake. Clark County deputys who were

questioned about this theory won't

discount it completely. Even though

this area is crossed by state route 503

and is walked over by hunters and

timber men, they say that the under-

growth is dense in places and that a

body might be missed. The shores of

the lake were searched carefully for

any sign of the man, the money or

the chutes and no traces were found.

But the FBI has given up searching,

so they must feel this is no longer a

reasonable possibility.

Theory number three therefore

seems more plausible than one or

two. Perhaps he didn't jump when the

Captain thought he did, but stayed

out there on the extended stairs until

a later time. Perhaps he did wait for

the flatlands of the Williamette Valley

before he took his leave.

But if he did, and if he survived,

what happened to him after he landed.

He still had no way to know exactly

where he was. Therefore when he

came down he would have to leave

his parachutes and either walk or

hitchhike to a town where he could

obtain transportation. According to

the FBI, authorities all along the

route of flight were alerted that night

and it wasn't until the next day that

it became general knowledge that the

search was being concentrated in

the Lake Merwin area. And if he

left the parachutes, isn't it reasonable

to think that they or their remains

would have been discovered by now?

Another factor that supports the

theory that Cooper did not survive

is the fact that none of the money has

ever turned up. The numbers of the

10,000 twenty-dollar bills were circu-

lated to banks in a 34 page booklet

and have been widely publicized by

the Portland Newspapers, the Oregon

Journal and the Oregonian. They

have a reward offer which still stands

of $1,000 for the first twenty-dollar

bill on the list to turn up.

This brings us to theory number

four. Could he have bailed out some-

where other than the Lake Merwin

area and not survived?

PRESS RELEASE

DONALD W. NYROP, President, Northwest Orient Airlines,

Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, has authorized a finders

fee of twentyfive thousand dollars total reward, or fifteen

percent for any portion of the D. B. COOPER ransome money

that is returned.

A man identifying himself as COOPER extorted two

hundreded thousand dollars from Northwest Orient Airlines

on November 24, 1971, while on a flight from Portland

to Seattle. He parachuted into an area east of loodland,

Washington with the ransomb money and it is possible the

money, which is comprised of ten thousand, twenty dollar

bills, is still in a wooded area in southern Washington.

The ransome money is marked and all the bills can

be identified. Nr. NYROP stated on October 5, 1972, in

Ninneapolis, that he would not hesitate to authorize a

finders fee of twentyfive thousand dollars total reward

or fifteen percent for any portion of the ransome money

that is returned.

Reference Seattle airtel to the Bureau dated

In order that this case be given more publicity,

the following leads are being set forth for Bureau

consideration and approval:

1. Mats should be made of the artist's conception

of Unsub so that small publications with limited

funds can feature articles concerning this matter

and include with the story a picture of Unsub

without incurring the additonal expense of having

new mats made (Note: • An editor of the Veterans'

of Foreign Wars publication for the State of

Oregon has requested such a mat to print a

picture of Unsub in his next issue).

2. If the artist's conception of Unsub is changed

as suggested in referenced airtel, mats of the

new picture should also be made.

Ft. Lewis, Washington, telephone

advised that it was his intention

if FBI approval is given, to make a "low keyed response"

to the press to the effect that "we are resuming the

search in the south."

advised that, since the movement of

troops and helicopters from Ft. Lewis to the Vancouver area,

would generate press inquiries" he planned to contact the

press on his own iniative, possibly on 4/7/72, to advise them of

the above.

advised that the Department of the Army had

given its approval and felt that the previous search had

been an excellent training vehicle.

was advised that any clearance would

have to come from SAC MILNES who was unavailable at the time

and he requested that when MI. MILNES was available that

_be contacted at the above telephone numbers.

After discussing this with Mir. MIINES I called

Assistant Director BATES called from DivisonG. He

said that they had a call from the Public Affairs Officer

of the Army.

The Army is sending out to their Public Affairs

officers in the field certain questions and answers which they

anticipate using in connection with publicity in regard

to the search.

Question 1: Is the Army assisting the FBI in its

search for a sky jacker?

Answer:

At the request of

the FBI

approximately 200 U. S. Army troops from Ft. Lewis

are assisting in the search for a sky jacker, believed to

have parachuted in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon, on

the 24th of November 1971.

There is a possibility this

sky jacker could have died in his jump. (The Bureau suggested

to the Army that they change Portland to LaCenter, Washington)

Question No. ? relates purely to the justification for

the U. S. Army, which is supposed to be defending this country,

being used in a situation like this and in answer to it the

Army sacalthey feel it is justified since th it came

the request of a responsible government agency and is related

BATES did not give me this verbatim since we would not

be concerned with it.

Thax No. 3 is another Army question which raises

is such support legal and the Army answer is Yes.

BATES suggests that we make no comment otner than to

say, Yes, the Army is assisting us in the search and we

have no further comment.

He said that with regard to SAC MILNES' phone call earlier

today, they had arranged with the banks to check any

large deposits of 20's and to advise the FBI of any suspicious

situation where anybody attempted to change 20's for other

denominations.

They have also alerted the casinos in the

In regard to the newspaper, he advised that

the newspaper in Reno was not willing to publish the ransom

IF THE PAPER WOULD BE WILLING TO PUBLISH THIS LIST.

HAS ADVISED THAT A STUDY OF THE COST OF THIS

MATTER REVEALS THAT LABOR COSIS IN COMPOSING WOULD RUN APPROXIMATELY

SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE NEWS PRINT COST WOULD RUN APPROXIMATELY

ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SHOULD THEY PUBLISH THIS AT THE PUBLIC SERVICE

RATE, THE COST WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND DOLLRAS AND AT

THE REGULAR COMMERCIAL RATE, II WOULD RUN APPROXIMATELY FIVE

THOUSAND DOLLARS. HE HAS ADVISED THAT BY PROVIDING A REPRINTED MAT,

THE COMPOSITION COST WOULD NOT BE ELIMINATED SINCE THEIR UNION

CONTRACT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE COST BE PAID NONETHELESS.

HAS INQUIRED IF THE BUREAU WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY THE

ACTUAL COST UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PUBLISHING THIS LIST.

I PRESUME THE COST WOULD BE COMPARABLE IF OTHER DAILY

NEWSPAPERS WERE REQUESTED TO PUBLISH THE LIST SINCE ALL WOULD BE

FACED WIT THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

OF THE SEATTLE POSI-INTELLIGENCER,

HAS ALSO BEEN APPROACHED BY ME CONCERNING THIS MATTER BUT HAS NOT

RESPONDED THUS FAR TO MY INQUIRY.

I KNOW OF NO WAY WHERE THE LIST COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO AS

MANY PEOPLE AS PUBLICATION THROUGH A DAILY NEWSPAPER. THE SEATTLE

TIMES CIRCULATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF WASHINGION, ITS

PRINCIPLE CIRCULATION AREA BEING THE SEATTLE METROPOLITAN AREA.

IN THE EVENT MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS TO BE ONTAINED,

THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THE SAME STEPS BE TAKEN BY A DAILY NEWSPAPER

IN PORTLAND, SANRAMENTO, SAN FRANCISCO AND POSSIBLY RENO, NEVADA.

BUREAU IS REQUESTED TO ADVISE IF IT WOULD AUTHORIZE THE

EXPENDITURE OF UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PUBLICATION OF

THIS LIST IN THE SEATTLE TIMES.

Dear

I appreciate your thoughtfulness in

writing to me and forwarding your suggestion

concerning the distribution of the list of

currency paid in the hijacking of Northwest

Airlines Flight 305.

While undoubtedly there is considerable

merit to your suggestion, we have not been in the

practice of selling the material we distribute.

We are trying to get this published through the

news media.

Whether we succeed or not will be

determined in time.

Sincerely yours,

MEMO TO EARL MILNES

Dear Earl:

After I called you this morning, I told

I would call back in the

afternoon but I was

Jand didn't get back as early as I had figured.

With current events as they are, I know that you have your hands full

and i don't intend to take but just a moment of your time.

were discussing the extensive list which had to be printed

and sent out with regard to the currency which was turned over to the

hijacker and the cost (to the taxpayers) which was run up in getting the

booklet printed and mailed all over the country. This may or may not

be a matter of particular interest to you,

came up with an idea

which might help recover some of those printing costs and, with any

luck, might even turn up some of the items which are listed.

That is for the FBI to get a news release out to every daily newspaper

(thru AP or UPl wire) that copies of the list of bills, in booklet form,

are available to anyone interested at a cost of $1.00 apiece. Not that

she nor I subscribe to the "hero-worship" concept we've been reading

about, but we believe there'd be hundreds who would like to get ahold

of a copy... either for curiosity's sake or as a souvenir item. In addition

to making the books available for a buck apiece, the news item could

also point out that if an actual bill was turned up, J. Edgar Hoover

would buy it back for $21.00, thereby returning their investment on

the book.

I know it may sound weird but, on the other hand, I can see how it

also might even turn up some real good leads.

M

On 12/10/71 I called SA HENRY SHUTZ at the Bureau.

I told him we were contacting a number of daily

newspapers, urging them as a public service to publish serial

numbers of the bills taken in this case.

I suggested that

as an economic matter it might be more desirable to have the

Bureau prepare a mat containing these numbers, which could

be distributed to newspapers and used by them as a means

of printing and thereby, hopefully, be able to encourage

more to print the list.

I talked to SA BLAND about this matter and he

advised that it would have to be initiated by the investiga-

tive division.

.. SA SHUTZ called me back on 12/10/71 and advised

they were exploring the possible costs of this matter and

would let us know Monday.

In the meantime I had talked to

of the SEATTLE P-I, and tol

of the SEATTLE TIMES, inquiring of them if as

public service would they be interested in publishing

the list. Both advised it would be considered and they

would let us know.
