On

February 14, 1974,

Washington State Board of Prison Terms and Paroles,

made available the file, number 6737 concerning HAROLD RAY

HARDESTY, FBI Number 109 477. Also made available was a

photograph of HARDESTY taken

1 on July 2, 1954, which is the

most recent photograph available in this file.

According to the file, HARDESTY committed 19 armed

robberies during the year of

1941; was the ring leader of

three robbers; used a pistol in the execution of these

robberies and offered as an explanation after being caught

that he was obtaining money for which to buy an airplane.

He was

sentenced out of King County for a 9-year minimum

sentence on January 30, 1942. On July 4, 1944, HARDESTY

escaped from the Walla Walla Penitentiary by fire bombing a

guard tower and

using grappling hooks and lines to scale the

walls. Subsequently he was apprehended by Federal authorities

in the Detroit, Michigan area and was convicted for interstate

transportation

of stolen property. For this he was committed

to the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth. At the expiration

of this term he

was returned to the Walla Walla Penitentiary

on March 3, 1950.

He was then tried and found guilty of escape

and sentenced to 10 years. He was paroled on September 28,

1954 to the custody

of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. D. HARDESTY,

14301 East Burnside, Portland, Oregon.

He was handled by the

Portland Office of the Probation and Parole Division in the

State of Oregon.

He was still interested in flying at that

time; he found a job in a cheap hotel and was still living with

his parents at the time of his conditional discharge From-

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

This list in no way represents all the means avail-

able to process a suspect.

Each individual case prompts a

different method; one or more of the below listed methods

have been used in the past.

1.

Obtain current descriptive data (particularly

useful is age, height and complexion),

2. Ascertain location on November 24, 1971, by

(a) checking employment records.

(D) checking cancelled checks or credit card

transactions.

(c) interviewing acquaintances or relatives

(note November 24th was the day before

Thanksgiving, 1971).

3.

Ascertain present location to determine if he

is alive or if he appears to be in hiding.

or parachuting li.e. private pilot's license,

skydiving experience, or nilitary jump

experience).

5.

Obtain

current photograph, color if possible,

to display to witnesses.

(Note: All NORJAK

eyewitnesses

have been repeatedly contacted

and have reviewed numerous photographs.

Up

to now

they have been extremely cooperative,

not withstanding the many contacts they have endured both at

work and at home. Based on the above, these witnesses will

not be contacted to view photographs unless there is no other

way to eliminate

a suspect).

6. Compare suspect's fingerprints and palm prints

with

tion

NORJAK partials on file it the Identifica-

Division

7. Ascertain if he is in any way familiar with

the Pacific Northwest area and in particular if

he ever flew over this area.

8. Check current financial situation and contrast

it to his situation prior to NORJAK.

9. Determine if he smokes cigarettes or if he

ever

smoked cigarettes. (Note: Unsub smoked

Raleigh cigarettes).

10.

Determine if he was registered at a motel or

hotel near the Portland Airport just prion to

NORJAK.

11. Determine if he made any trial runs prior to

NORJAK on

airlines flying between Portland and

Seattle.

13.

Compare his hair to hair fiber found on NURJAK

It should be noted that this crime was committed

San Francisco Division advised by communication

dated 1/2/74 as follows:

Ju. S. Parachute Associa-

tion, Monterey, California, has advised his office staff is

rather snall and his own work schedule usually crowded and

therefore, he would prefer checks of his records be limited

to those suspects on whom he might provide worthwhile infor-

mation.

If any suspect has not been eliminated through other

investigation, and should

the FBI desire other specific infor-

mation not otherwise obtained but which might be available

from the U. S. Parachute Association,

DETAILS:

Investigation to identify Unsub. to date has been

negative.

Prior to the hunting season which began in October,

1973, the Seattle Division again disseminated information con-

cerning this matter to hunters via the Washington State Game

Wardens responsible for the area into which Unsub. parachuted.

At the end of the 1973 hunting season, no positive

results were achieved from the leads that were received because

of the publicity made available to Pacific Northwest hunters.

On 12/17/73, EARL COSSEY advised that the parachute

supplied to Unsub. was made of a white "rip-stop" material in-

vented since 1945. Several of the canopies shown to him as.

possibly being identical with Unsub.'s parachute were made of

a "twill" material manufactured prior to 1945.

Further, COSSEY

stated, the parachutes supplied to Unsub. were of a nonstearable

variety with no stearing devices whatever.

It is noted that although COSSEY "packed" Unsub. 's

emergency.

The main parachute used by Unsub. is described as

follows:

Model NB6 (Navy Back Pack 6) in a sage green nylon

container with matching harness, without "D" rings to attach

an auxiliary parachute.

The parachute has a 28-foot white

nylon flat circular canopy with a specially fitted foam padded

cushion.

The pilot chute is also white. The "chest pack"

parachute used by Unsub. was a training pack dummied up to

look like a good parachute for training purposes. It has no

pilot chute and its canopy is white in color.

On 11/22/73, the Portland, Oregon Journal Newspaper

offered a reward of $1,000 for the first missing $20 bill

"racovered from the loot collected two years

ago by D. B.

COOPER, the still missing parachuting airplane hijacker."

In a Portland, Oregon Journal article dated 11/26/73, the

following information was published:

b7C

$200,000 that disappeared the night of Nov. 24, 1971, with

the parachuting hijacker popularly known as D. B. COOPER.

"The plan can be used with or separate from the

newspaper's offer to pay $1,000 for the first $20 bill to be

turned in that can be verified by the FBI to be part of the

money Cooper obtained from Northwest Orient Airlines prior

to jumping from a jetliner he had commandeered. It can be used

to return the money, enter into negotiations for its returnor

to provide information on the whereabouts of the elusive hijacker.

"The 'Secret Witness' plan will enable someone with one

or more of the missing bills to surrender the money and still keep

his or her identity secret.

"Here is how to use the plan:

corners of the first page write a code, using any combin-

ation of numbers and letters.

tear. Keep the torn off corner bearing your code and: mail

report containing the duplicate code to 'Secret Witness,'

• Journal, 1320 SW Broadway, Portland, Ope. 97201.

"The Journal will forward your information to the

FBI which will pick up the money and verify whether it is

indeed from the Cooper ransom. If it is, that fact will be

published in the newspaper.

"After that, give the torn off corner you have kept

to a trusted friend or to an attorney or to your minister with

instructions to take it directly to the Secret Witness plan

coordinator at The Journal.

If the codes and torn edges match,

your agent will be given the $1,000 for the first

$20 of the

"Cooper cash' to be turned in."

In addition to the above reward,

Northwest Orient Airlines, authorized a finder's

fee of $25,000 total reward or 15% of any portion of the D.B.

COOPER ransom money that is returned.

Finally, the Seattle Post Intelligencer Newspaper

has offered a $5,000 reward in connection with its "Secret

Witness Program"

for information leading to the arrest and

conviction of the person responsible for this crime.

On 11/29/73, the following article was published

in the Iacoma, Washington News Tribune under the headline

"Skyjacker Cooper: Still A Folk Hero, Still A Mystery":

"Two years after parachuting from a Northwest

Airlines jet with $200,000 in ransom money, the skyjacker

known as Dan Cooper remains a folk hero and a mystery..

"He is, according to the U.S. Department of

Transportation, the only person ever to hijack a domestic

airliner who has not been killed or brought to justice.

instructions to the pilot.

"He wanted 10,000 $20 bills to be delivered to him

at Seattle in a laundry

sack, along with two sets of parachutes.

Otherwise he threatened to blow up the plane.

"Airline officials and Federal Bureau of Investiga-

tion agents complied with his requests and Cooper allowed

the passengers and two of the three stewardesses to disembark

at Seattle.

"Then he ordered the plane to fly south to Reno,

Nev., at 200 miles per hour, at 10,000 feet, flaps down. The

crew was to stay in the cockpit.

"After takeoff from Seattle, a red light flashed in

the cockpit indicating the plane's rear boarding ramp had been

unlatched.

"That was the last ever heard of him.

"When the plane landed in Reno, the rear ramp was

down and Cooper was gone. The 21-pound sack of money was

gone. One set of parachutes was gone. The skyjacker, who

had carefully reclaimed his note to the stewardess, had left

no fingerprints.

"Authorities believed Cooper jumped from the plane

near woogland, Wash. The town was transformed into a bustling

command post for a small army of newsmen and dozens of FBI

agents, police and soldiers from Ft. Lewis.

"With planes, helicopters, Jeeps and track dogs,

they combed the vast, densely wooded region northeast of

woodland. Much of it was rugged terrain, thick with freshly

fallen snow, and virtually impassable.

"The hijacker left the plane clad only in a light

business suit and street shoes.

He parachuted into the black-

ness of a raging thunderstorm, into a 200 m.p.h. hour wind

and temperatures of minus 7 degrees.

"He could not have survived, police reasoned. They

said they were simply looking for

a body and a bag of money

and that could wait until the spring thaw. A week later

the army of searchers was disbanded.

"In the ensuing months Cooper became a legend in

the

on the case, to no avail."

The Seattle Division advised Minneapolis by airtel

dated 7/23/73 as follows:

It is possible that Unsub. made a trial run or

runs prior to NORJAK, with the purpose of perfecting his

hijack plan. If passenger lists of flights from Portland

to Seattle for two weeks prior to NORJAK could be obtained

the names on these lists could be compared to NORJAK indices,

and other lists currently on file at Seattle in order to

possibly identify Unsub.

In an attempt to determine if Unsub. made a trial

run prior to NORJAK,

_ Northwest Orient

Airlines, Seattle, Washington, was contacted and furnished

the following information:

Records of reservations arestored in Northwest Orient

Airline Univac Computer Systems and can be retrieved as far

back as

5 years. Copies of tickets sold by Northwest Orient

Airlines are on file and can also be reviewed.

Concerning the above, the Minneapolis Division ad-

vised that tapes recording passengers of alt Northwest Orient

Airlines flights are maintained by Northwest Orient Airlines

only six (b) months.

The tapes are then erased and reused.

No passenger lists for Northwest Orient Airlines flights fron

Portland to Seattle from 11/10/71 to 11/23/71 are in existence.

Novato, California, advised as follows:

Since he had seen

the movie "Airport" on television

he has given a great deal of thought as to how this crime was

perpetrated. He stated that he was principally interested in

obtaining any reward that might be fortheoming for furnishing

information concerning this case.

He also

• stated that he had

formally worked on airplanes and

was familiar with them; how

e 95? he did not know the difference between a Boeing 727 and

in essence,

theory is that the hijacker was

probably a mechanic

for Northwest Orient Airlines and at sone

access to this particular

aircraft.

According tol

any confident mechanic, if

given enough time, could remove panels from the airplane,

either in the floor or restroom area, secrete, himself in the

space after fashioning some kind of

device to pull the panel

or floor in behind him. He suggested that

the hijacker could

above manner.

tave gotte into the cathe ne a tat mechan o with the

Airline could have

accomplished these things at any time when

the aircraft was having a major overhaul.

It should be pointed out that in all probability

the hijacker jumped from the aircraft since there was evidence

of a pressure change when the stairwell closed apparently

after a heavy object jumped from the stairs.

The

same pres-

sure change occurred when a subsequent demonstration was con-

ducted by throwing a 150 lb. object from the stairs.

The Minneapolis Division advised by communication

dated 1/4/74 as follows:

Northwest Orient Airlines, was contacted on 12/17/73.

advised that it would be

virtually impossible for

unknown subject to remove panels from the airplane, either in

the floor or restroom area, in order to secrete himself under

the floor of the airplane:

He advised that in order to remove

the panels, rivets must be removed. He advised that the floor

panels are

small and it would require the removal of several

of the panels in order for a man to secrete himself under the

Jadvised that an individual very familiar with

the aircraft could get from the cabin area

to the

cargo area

using internal passages.

He advised that if the individual

accomplished this feat,

he would experience extreme cold. He

advised that the air pressure in the cargo area is adjusted

and could be tolerated by an individual.

She also noticed a large path going down the hill

Part of the tree is still crushed.

At approximately 1030 hours this date while on duty at "C" Checkpoint, a man

came up to the Scanray who looked very familiar to R/O. The first thing that

aught my eye was his hair, and I thought it was_D. B. Cooper who hijacked

description I got fron

looking at him was as follows: approximately 6' tall, 170 Ibs., black hair

(receding), W/M/A, age in 40's, olive complexion, wearing a brown suit and

carrying a briefcase approximately 14" long, 10" high and 4" wide.

When he

arrived at the checkpoint the first thing he did was put out a cigarette in

the ash can. He looked at me and immediately turned his head. .

The description

of subject on composite is as follows: W/M, middle 40's, 5' 10" to 6',

170 - 180 lbs., dark brown or black hair, heavy smoker, wearing black or

brown suit, carrying brief case.

After I had been relieved on the checkpoint, I came up to the office to

see if we had a picture of subject and none could be found.

I went back to

the detectives' office

and asked L

him if he saw him. We both then went down to C-6 and they were boarding

the flight.

said that it was very close resemblance. We stood

so that as they were walking to the gate we could get a face-on view and

when he saw us, he put his boarding pass under his nose to hide his mouth.

We let him board and I then contacted FAA and gave them the information and

they took over.

AT SIERRA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

On October 25, 1974, Sheriff SAM DOYLE Of

the Sierra County, California, Sheriff's Office,

telephonically advised

Sacramento Division of

the FBI that some hunters in the vicinity of Sierra-

ville, California, had located some property which

he wished to bring to the attention of the FBI in

view of the skyjacking case in which an individual

known as D. B. COOPER parachuted from the craft

approximately two years ago.

DOYLE stated that the hunters found among

other things a harnass which probably was a portion

of a parachute or parachutes.

He advised that there

were other quantities of what appeared to be camping

equipment.

He stated that the material found, however,

was extremely deteriorated and it appeared that it

probably had been exposed to the elements for ten or

more years. He advised that he believed that his

two or three years.

said there were large quantities

of what appeared to be camping equipment and it was

felt that the property had been exposed to the elements

for at least ten years.

He stated that there formerly was a para-

medic training facility operating out of the stead

Air Base near Reno, Nevada, and that trainees and

instructors from that facility often parachuted into

and trained in the Sierraville area.

He stated that he was quite certain that

the highly deteriorated property found had been left

by those trainees.

Jadvised that after coming to

that conclusion he had disposed of the property at

the Sierraville dump.

On October 25, 1974, a physical observation

at the Sierraville dump

concluded the discarded property

could not be located.

Memorandum

TO

: SAC, SEATTLE (164-81) (P)

DATE: 12/4/74

FROM : SC

SUBJECT: NORJAK

On 12/3/74, an anonymous male caller, loud and possibly

elderly, telephonically called the Seattle FBI. Office anc

isked the writer if he was an "authority or a fluniy." j

gave him my name and position,

and he demanded he be connected

to a special, agent.

I asked

him what information he had, and

he then explained that he tried to talk to SAC JULIUS MATTSON,

FBI Poraland, but could not get through to him. He said

he will mail

a List of questions in a couple of days,

and those questions will deal with captioned matter. He

said the crime was a "great thing," and that fifteen people

took part in it, not one.

He then

said he would like to

be there when the Victim plane is basearched by the FBI.

He would not explain further.

The caller was asked if he will have his name on the

communication, so as to enable the FBI to contact him in

the future if

something needed clarification. He said

that he would put a lot of numbers at the end and we could

figure out the rest.
