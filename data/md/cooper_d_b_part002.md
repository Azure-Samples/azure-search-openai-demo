Next morains, he drove to a remote

spot, burned part of his gear and buried

the rest, along with the money, "in a spot

whete nobody will ever, ever find it."

• Several days later, Cooper inadvertant-

•ly discovered that although the money

was not marked, authorities had the

serial numbers of every $20 bill he

possessed. So though he had the money,

he couldn't spend it. What to do? He

thought of taking it to Mexico, or Europe,

X and "fencing" it. But he was an engineer,

not a criminal. Therefore, operating on

alien turf, he figured to lose not only

the money, but his life as well. He was

"furious. He felt he had been double-

crossed. Here he had a fortune, and

couldn't spend a dime of it.
