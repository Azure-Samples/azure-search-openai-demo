of the alrcraft passengers, I

believed

unsub was & Moxican-American.

She had & short

encounter

with the unsub prior to hor deplaning at seattle, at which

time she sald unsub did not appear to know exactly where he

wanted to go after he left seattle, but spoke of lexico city,

Phoenix, und San Francisco.

Stewardese

then

acted as a communications modla between

the unsub and the

captain of the aircraft until about five minutes after tho

aircraft depaited

the Seattle-Tacona National Alxport (Saa-Tac)

when she was instructed to go to the cockpit by the unsub.

The aircratt landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 p.w., PST,

at which time $200,000 in twenty dollar bille, velghing

19 pounde, two back chutes, and two chest chutes were made

available

to him.

The passengers then vere allowed to deplane

as vere Sterardoss

and another stewardess. This is

normally a thirty-six minute

flight.

Shortly prior to the aircraft taking off from

Bea-Tac at 7:36 p.n., PST, the unsub informod stewardess

that they

ware going to Moxico City or soneplace

In Mexico and that the aircraft could stop unywhere la Mexico

to reluel, but nochere in the united states.

Then unsub was

Informed that the fuel would not permit the alrcralt gosng to

Mexico, unsub compromised and said he would prefor a refueling

landing in RenD, nevada. The last communscation had with the

unsub was by interphone at 8:05 p.u,, PST, and it was felt

that the unaub deplanod from the aircraft at 8:12 p.ll. The

alicraft landed at Reno, Nevada, at 11:05 p.t., PST,

extensive ground search of the area where it was believed

the unsub exited the aircraft has proved negative.

Then the adrcraft landed at Reno, Nevada, a

chest pack chute and a back-type chute were found on the

plane.

The missing chest back chute is a training pack

"dunnied up" to look like a good one. The missing back

pack chute, sometiues referred to as an amergency chute, la

non-steerable and anyone uttlizing this type chute would

have no chance of slowing down or picking his spot on which

to land.

Also located in seat 18E of the aircraft at

Reno, Nevada, was a black clip-on tie which contained a tie

She observed him using a book of

matches, the cover of which was blue and bore the nave

"Sky Chef."

Stewardest

asked him why he had chosen a North-

west airplane to aljack to which he replied that he had a

grudge but not against Northwest Alrlines, but that Northwest

happened to be at the right place at the right time.

7)

he used the expression "No fuss" on one occasion to

Stewardess

and "No funny stuff"

on one occasion

to Stewardess

You should place strong euphasis on the fact that

the unsub could be possibly a former employee of one of the

West Coast aircraft or related industries, particularly

Boeing aircraft:

These industries have been hard pressed

economically; causing a number of lay-offs among professional

personnel as well as nonprofessional personnel and fron a

review of the matorial available at tho Bureau, it is entirely

conceivable that the unsub falls in this category.

In 710V

of this,

the following avenues of investigation should be

investigated by both the Seattle and Portland Offices:

1) Contact professional placement agencies, counselors as well

as, omploynent contractors hiring temorazy professional

employees.

2) Contact unemployment agencies.

3) . Identify and contact professional societies or

organizations associated with the aircraft industry, being

alert for anyone that possibly terminated nembership or

activity after 11/24/71.

The age bracket of the unknown subject could probably

make him a Veteran of World War Il, or the Korean conflict

and in this regard, you should contact

Veteran groups and

the American Legion.

5) Seattle should submit to the PBI Laboratory the black

clip-on tio and clasp found on tho aircraft at Reno, Nevada,

and request the FBI laboratory to examine this materinl for

soil and dust particlos in an effort to possibly pinpoint

the aroa of the

country fron which the unsub came fron.

In order that this case be given more publicity,

the following leads are being set forth for Bureau

consideration and approval:

1. Mats should be made of the artist's conception

of Unsub so that small publications with limited

funds can feature articles concerning this matter

and include with the story a picture of Unsub

without incurring the additonal expense of having

new mats made (Note: • An editor of the Veterans'

2. If the artist's conception of Unsub is changed

as suggested in referenced airtel, mats of the

new picture should also be made.

SUBJECT: NORJAK

RE: ARVIST'S CONCEPTION

Enclosed is a copy of photo Kk5-1 in the Facial

Lines Section of the Facial Identification Catalogue, and a

copy of the artist's composice of UNSUB.

The following information is being submitted for

Bureau review, and the enclosed leads are being set forth

on an UACB basis:

On 12/2/71,

a key witness,

insisted that the artist's conception was not a good likeness

166

b7C

of the hijacker.

She requested permission to examine the

Facial Identification Catalogue and immediately picked out

photograph KK5-1 in the Facial Lines

Section stating,

"that

is him, except for the ears and hair."

She explained that the

person depicted in that particular photograph resembled

the man; however, the ears of the hijacker did not protzude

as far from the head and she felt that the hair line should

be somewhat lower than that on the man depicted on photo

KR5-1.

She was very adamant in her insistence that the

artist's conception shown to her was not a good likeness

of the hijacker.

A comparison of the artist's composite.of UNSUB

and photo KK5~1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man nuch

younger than the man depicted in photo KK5-1,

The man in

KK5-1 appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite

the man in his late 20s or early 305. 64-41 - 14

In addition, the following witnesses

indicated

their dissatisfaction with the artist's sketch:

Witness

advised on 11/29/71, that

the artist's composite of UNSUB depicted a man too young.

Witness

I advised on 11/29/71,

the man depicted in artist's

composite appears younger than

UNSUB actually is.

Stewardess

on 11/25/71,

advised the man dopicted in artist's composite 1s "too young.

To date 475 suspects have been developed based on

appearance, as well as other Features.

Many of the suspects

were developed because of their resemblance to the artist's

composite of Unsus. A great number of these suspects have

turned out to be in their 20a or early 30s, with light or

fair complexion.

According to witnesses, UNSUB's age is in

the nid-40s and his complexion is olive or Latin in appearance.

The artist's composite clearly looke like a man in his late

20s or early 30s and his complexion is difficult to determine

fron the black and white sketch.

Many agent hours are necessary to eliminate a

suspect once developed.

Redoing the artist's composite to

better approximate the age and complexion of uNSuB should

save many fruitless hours of agent investigation time.

Fron a revlew of Seattle report of SA CHARLES E.:

FARRELL dated 2/16/72, it is apparent that the only witnesses

to see UNSUB for any longth of time, at a close distance,

were the three Northwest Airlines stewardesses.

Therefore,

their opinions should be given more consideration and any

artist's conception of UNSUB should reflect nore of their

views than those of the other witnesses.

In view of the above the following lead is

being set forth on an UACE basis:

A Bureau artist will recontact the three Northvest

Airlinos stewacdesses and amend the current composite to botter

reflect his age and complexion.

the sketch should be done in

color, showing full face, ful tace with dark glasses, 3id€

profile and a sketch showing the hijackers height and baili

in a standing position.

All sketches should be in colór to

indicate UNSUB's swarthy complexion,

The FBI Laboratory vill provide information to

the Bureau artist as to color of hair based upon a single

hair sample submitted previously by the Las Vegas Division.

It is noted that thie

hair was found on the head rest towel

the back of the seat reportedly occupied by UNSUB.

It is further noted that this hair is boing held by the

Las Vegas Division as evidence,

If the exact color of the

hair was not determined in the initial Laboratory

examination, the las vegas Division should be dilecteo

to forward it to the Laboratory for a color exanination.

The Seattle Division will, upon receipt of copies

of the amended sketch, supervise its distribution.

Dear Sir:

On Septembor 15, 1972,

National Bank of Oregon, Coos Bay Branch, Coos Bay, Oregon,

exhibited to Special Agent LeRoy R. Elliott of our office, a

$20.00 Federal Reserve Note, which on close analysis was found

to be segments of four different $20.00 notes scotch taped

together on the back side.

The purpose in this would appear

to be to change the serial number as each segment contains only

one-half of the original serial nunber.

The decoption is easily noted on examination, because

the two serial numbers appearing on the face of tho bill, one

on the lover left, the other in the upper right corner, are

not identical.

Attached is a penciled sketch made of the bill,

which l

advised he would retain and make available

to your office.

Very truly yours,

Approximately one year before the actual hijacking,

he had been in the Six-Pack Bar in Kelso, Washington, when he

overheard a conversation involving several individuals at an

adioinine table.

The only person he recognized was

kelso, Washington, He

knew this individual to be a pilot and sky jumper who spent

The conversation concerned a hypothetical

He indicated he

would have 14 or 15 hours head start because he is so often

out of the country.

The entire conversation was very similar

It was further ascertained that HAGAN has paid

$200 per month child support payments

and in 1972, a bench warrant

was issued for HAGAN's arrest for delinquency in making support

payments since 1968.

This warrant was dismissed when HAGAN

appeared and satisfied Superior Court In Los Angeles regarding

the delinquency in mid 1972.

Records of the California Department of Motor Vehicles,

Division of Driver's Licenses, reveals driver's license number

B0821308 was issued to HARRY

residence. 13423 Excelsior Drive, Norwalk, California, effective

2/16/73.

This record indicates other address of "Route 2,

BOX ITIA, Silverton, effective 3/5/71"

A review of U.S. Postal Guide reveals there 1s

no post office of Silverton in California; however, indicates

there is a post office at Silverton, Oregon in Marian County.

Recorâs of the Glendale, California Police Department

reveal HAGAN was arrested in 1960 for battery and sentenced

to 180 days, suspended. He was fined $250 and placed on two

years probation. Index cards retained by the Glendale Police

Department reveal he came to their attention in 1962, 1965,

1967 and 1958, with no arrests indicated. He was the

complainant four times in 1960 regarding auto theft, two

burglaries and one petty theft. He furnished a different

address on each occasion.

Discreet inquiry in the vicinity of 3400

San Fernando Road, Los Angeles, reveals HAGAN claimed

to

be a successful salesman for Open Road Campers in the

Seattle, Washington area prior to setting up business

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

I and the

fact was noted that he could not have been on the plane since

he was at The Dalles.

There was no FBI release to the press concerning

the above suspect, but the press coverage in Oregon, and in

the state of lashington was so intense, it may have become

known to the press, that the above

contacted by a police officer.

It is suggested that the fact that the name "D.B.

COOPER" is not involved in this matter not be given publicity

outside the Bureau in order to utilize this fact as an aid

in the initial evaluation of new leads.

INVESTIGATIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

This list in no way represents all the means avail-

able to process a suspect. Each individual case prompts a

different method; one

or more of the below listed methods

have been used in the past.

1. Obtain current descriptive data (particularly

useful is age, height and complexion)

2. Ascertain location on November 24, 1971, by

(a) checking employment records.

(b) checking cancelled checks or credit card

transactions.

3.

(c) interviewing acquaintances or relatives

(note November 24th was the day before

Thanksgiving, 1971).

Ascertain present location to determine if he

is alive or if he appears to be in hiding.

Up

to now they have been extremely cooperative,

not withstanding the many contacts they have endured both at

work and at home.

Based on the above, these witnesses will

not be contacted

to view photographs unless there is no other

way to eliminate a suspect).

6. Compare suspect's fingerprints and palm prints

with NORJAK partials on file in the Identifica

tion Bureau.

Ascertain if he is in any way familiar with

the Pacific Northwest area and in particular if

he ever flew over this area.

8. Check current financial situation and contrast

it to his situation prior to NORJAK.

9. Determine if he smokes cigarettes or if he

smoked cigarettes. (Note: Unsub smoked

Raleigh cigarettes).

10. Determine if he was registered at a motel or

hotel near the Portland Airport just prior to

NORJAK.

11.

Determine if he made any trial runs prior to

NORJAK on

airlines flying between Portland and

Seattle.

PROFILE

ne purpose of the following information is t

conveniently list all the known facts concerning the hi

jacker's profile

and to combine them with suppositions that

can be reasonably inferred from those facts.

The suppositions

have been included to aid in processing a suspect.

should not be considered as concrete facts, nor should they

be used as the sole determining factor in drawing investi-

gative conclusions.

SUMMARY

Unsub was a well spoken, conservative gentleman;

probably a Catholic with Mexican

or Indian blood.

He was

not an alcoholic. He probably lived in the Portland or

Seattle areas or had flown more than once over these areas.

He apparently had no accomplices.

He was not an experienced

skydiver and most probably received his jump training in

the military. His hijacking plan was not well thought out,

and he was probably not an experienced criminal. He was

apparently having financial troubles prior to November,

1971, and he may have previously worked in an airline-

related indus try.

The reasons for the above suppositions are in-

cluded below.

BACKGROUND

It is felt Unsub was not an experienced criminal

because of his mannerism exhibited after he received the

ransom money.

Unsub reportedly became somewhat childish

in his actions and comments while counting

• the money.

Unsub was familiar with

the seattle area, as

indicated by his comments concerning the plane's location

as it flew over Tacona, Washington.

In addition, Unsub

made a comment as to the distance MoChord Air Force Base

in relation to Sea-Tac Airport.

Unsub reportedly

because of a grudge.

he may have had a

relative, possibly

a son, killed in Vietnam or he may have had recent finan-

cial problems which would foster such a grudge.

Unsub's complexion has been described as swarthy

or dark.

The grudge

associated with his backpround

which could possibly be Indian, Mexican or possibly

Italzan descent. Note unsub has been described by withess

las definitely having some Mexican or Indian

"blood" in him.

It is noted the northwest area at the time of the

hijacking was suffering from a depressed economic condition,

and since Unsub was familiar with the Seattle area as in-

it is possible Unsub was out of work at the

In addition, Unsub demonstrated considerable

knowledge of

aircraft and of

flying, and it is

felt he was

employed in the aircraft industry, either civilian or

military at one time in his life, therefore, it is logical

to assume unsub may possibly have been out of work in an

airlines-related industry.

His actions and reactions that occurred throushout

the hijacking indicate unsub

probably was not a desperate

man, nor was he mentally ill such as a paranoid type.

exhibited an unusually calm manner throughout the whole

hijacking.

Unsub was probably a "loner" and carried out the

hijacking by hinself, with no partners. Throughout the

hijacking, he exhibited a competency in reacting to various

situations that arose.

It is believed that Unsub was not

an experienced criminal, but a victim of circumstances.

Unsub's physical build and his handiness with the

parachute shroud lines indicates coordination and some

physical ability as will as inventiveness.

(It is noted

that during the hijacking unsub requested

a knapsack to put

the money in and he received

a small white bag instead.

bably always carries a small pocket knife with him.

1. Short style hair

2. Age mid 40's

3. Dark colored suit, dark colored raincoat,

white shirt, narrow black tie.

4. Unsub did not swear and showed a great deal

of respect for the stewardesses on the

airline because they were women.

(Unsub

engaged in a small argument with one of the

passengers, as well as experiencing extremely

tense and nervous situations, and through it

all he never used profane language - this

mighe indicate he is possibly a religious

Since he did drink, and since he is

possibly religious, he probably is not a

Badtist or Mormon. )

The following information tends to indicate Unsub

possibily possessed athletic ability:

1. His physical build was described as average

to well built, even though his age was

described as in his mid-40's.

2. His eat bited sual peel deterity using

small degree of physical ability.

It is felt unsub possibly maintains his physical

well being through regular exercise.

The following information tends to indicate the

Unsub was a gentleman:

1. He offered to tip the stewardesses on the

NORJAK flight after he received his ranson

money. He did not offer them ransom money

as the tip, but used his own money.

2. During the entire hijacking he did not use

profane language.

3. Throughout the hijacking he maintained a calm

demeanor and spoke low and intelligently.

The following information tends to indicate

Unsub lived in the northwest area at some time in his life:

I. Unsub knew the distance fron MeChord to

Sea-Tac and recognized Tacoma, Washington from

the air.

2. Unsub was dressed in a suit and lightweight

overcoat which is commonly worn by many north-

west area residents.

3. No accent or unusual speech mannerisms were

detected by the Northwest Airlines stewardesses

who had a chance to observe him.

SPORT PARACHUTIST

The hijacker is probably not a sports parachutist

nor is he a member of a sport parachute

club.

The reasons

for this are as follows:

The hijacker requested two back parachutes

and two front parachutes. He gave no specific

instructions as to

the type of parachute that

he desired.

(i.e. a sports parachutist would

probably have requested a steerable sport

• I

## Page 256

SE 164-81

2. Several sport parachutists have advised that

a sport parachutist possesses an emotional

attachment to his parachute and probably would

not jump from an aircraft with anyone else's

chute, nor would they jump with a chute they

had not packed themselves.

The hijacker was furnished a parachute that

opens quickly, has a high rate of descent, and one that was

not steerable.

3. The hijacker was furnished two front parachutes,

commonly called chest packs which are to be used

in an

emergency when the back pack parachute

or main parachute fails to open properly.

chest pack parachute the hijacker took with him

was a dummy parachute.

It was designed for lectures to demon-

strate to new parachutists the proper method of opening a

chest pack parachute. It is felt an experienced sports para-

chutist would probably have noticed this defect.

4. Unsub's age has been described as mid 40's

and it is noted that the average age in most

sport parachute clubs is mid 20's.

If Unsub

a member of a sport parachute club he would

certainly be an unusual member, one that would

be easily recognized by the other members, as well as one that

was well known because of his unusual age.

It is felt that due

to the large amount of publicity aforded this case, someone

in a sport parachute club would have recognized his fellow

"sky diver"' as being identical with Unsub if in fact Unsul

was a member of any sports parachute club.

When the stewardess presented the parachutes

to the hijacker she also presented an instruction sheet on

now to utilize a parachute.

At that time, Unsub stated he

11d not need anv instructions concerning the use of

parachute.

Since Unsub did not specify a specific type of

chute and because of the above reasoning concerning Unsub's

age, it is felt Unsub was not an experienced jumper or even

a sport jumper.

In addition, Unsub probably had some jump

training most probably obtained while in the military.

HABITS

Unsub drinks in moderation and is probably not an

alcoholic.

Unsub ordered one bourbon and seven at the be-

ginning of the flight and although he was offered several

free drinks later, he turned them down. This would indicate

that Unsub possessed sufficient willpower to refuse alcohol

in a tension-filled situation.

It is believed an alcoholic

on a former alcoholic who had just had one drink and was

placed in a situation of similar stress would succumb to the

pressure and imbibe in the free drinks offered him by the

stewardesses.

Located in the ashtray utilized by Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter cigarettes,

the eighth cigarette

is possibly the same.

These cigar-

ettes

are sold in a "soft pack". Unsub was in the aircraft

eight hours in an extremely tense situation. During the

eight hours, he had eight cigarettes. A two-pack-a-day

smoker would have consumed 20 cigarettes in eight hours

under normal circumstances. It is felt Unsub may possibly

smoke less than one pack a day.

CLOTHES

Located in Seat 18 E (the seat Unsub occupied)

was a black clip-on tie which contained a tie clip des-

cribed

as yellow gold in color, with a white pearl circular

stone in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name

"Towncraft" and bore the legend "Store 3, Penneys".

The

label in this tie showed it to be

a "Snapper" patent type

tie.

Investigation

at Las Vegas indicated this type tie

was sold for about $1.50 and that this particular tie was

about a vear to a ayear and a half old.

It was a favorite

• for individuals such as waiters, busboys and barten-

Stewardess

has said that this tie, found

on the aircraft, was probably Unsubs and other witnesses have

indicated he wore a similar type tie.

Since Unsub wore a tie during the hijacking and

for other reasons described above, it is felt he was possibly

an executive.

However, since the

tie was narrow and

clip-on type not currently in

style, Unsub was possibly

not on a top-level executive.

Unsub carried with him a cheap briefcase that

appeared to be new.

It is thought the hijacker probably

purchased this briefcase just prior to the hijacking to be

used during the hijacking only.

Unsub wore a white shirt with small collar points

indicating he probably did not have the money to obtain a

more fashionable wardrobe (i.e. more colorful shirts with

larger collars currently in style).

The white shirt could

also indicate the hijacker's conservative taste in clothing.

EDUCATION

Unsub was accessed to be a high school graduate

possibly with some college training, based primarily on

vocabulary used during the hijack.

Further, Unsub impressed

stewardesses as possibly being experienced in dealing

• with

people.

They, therefore, concluded he was the executive

type and seemed to naturally dictate the ransomed demands

to the stewardesses in lieu of writing the notes out himself.

Character:

CRIME AROARD AIRCRAFT - FIJACKING; FXTORTION

Synopsis:

On November 24, 1971, a white male skyjacked a North-

west Airlines

Flight

from Portland to Seattle. The

hijacker demanded and received $200,000 and four para-

chutes upon landing at Seattle-Tacoma International

Airport.

After receiving the ransom money, the hilacker

allowed the passengers to leave. The plane then took

off for Reno and

at 8:11 p.m. a pressure oscillation

noted by the plane's crew.

That pressure oscillation

was probably caused by the hijacker

leaving the aircraft.

Search of the aircraft at Reno revealed the hijacker

was not in the plane when it landed.

Extensive searches

of the area into which

the hijacker would have landed

failed to locate the hijacker or any evidence of value.

The initial black and white artist composite drawing

of the hijacker was changed to a color sketch to mure

accurately reflect the hijacker's age and swarthy

complexion.

The Unsub, akaL

at 2:00 PM, Pacific

Standard Time, November 24, 1971, purchased a one-way coach

ticket at the Portland International Airport, Portland,

Oregon,

for travel from Portland to Seattle, washington,

on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight Number 305, which was

a Boeing 727 aircraft.

Unsub paid for this flight with a

twenty dollar bill and had no luggage. He occupied seat

number 18 E on the aircraft.

The Boeing 727 has three seats on each side of

the aisle.

Row 18 is the last one on both the right and

left

side of the aisle.

The seats are identified from left

to right as you face the front of the aircraft with A, B,C

on the left side of the aisle and D (aisle seat), E (center seat›

and F (window seat) on the right side.

Almost flush against the back of row 18, except

for some eight inches near the

forms the wall for the lavatories, located behind row 18;

i the lava

aisle, is a bulkhead which

one on the right and one on the left.

Beyond the lavatory

doors is the door leading to the air stairs.

The door to the air stairs is always closed and

Locked, except when loading or unloading passengers.

It is

located straight away at the end of the aisle beyond row

18

and is perhaps some 3½ feet from the last row and is in

easy reach for someone sitting in row 18.

Built into the lower portion of the door to the

i staing

air stairs is the stewardess seat which is pulled down when

in use, so that a person sitting in that seat looks straight

down the aisle toward the front of the aircraft. On take-off

ront of the stone t

Prior to the time the aircraft taxied on the zun-

way, he purchased a bourbon and Seven Up from Stewardess

As the aircraft taxied toward the runway for

takeoff,

Unsub turned and handed Stewardess L

envelope containing a note written in black felt-tip pen on

plain white unlined paper which said:

"Miss, I have a bomb here and I would like you to

sit by me".

The hijacker then dictated the following:

"I want $200,000 by

' 5:00 p.m. in cash".

(No

specification as to denomination, age on sequence of bills).

"Put it in a knapsack.

I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes" (no other specification concerning para-

chute types).

"When we land I want a

fuel truck ready

to refuel"

(probably his flying experience

caused him to

add this).

"No funny stuff or I'll do the job" (the first

attempted parachute skyjacking had been foiled about 12

days earlier by the hijacked aircraft's crew.)

The hijacken showed both Stewardesses the contents

of his briefcase and stated it was an electrical device and

requested the aircraft radio be used as little as possible.

The hijacker explained why he hijacked this plane

by stating "it's not because I have a grudge against the

airlines, it's because I have a grudge."

The hijacker then added that the flight suited

his time, place and plans (probably the convenience of a

Portland to Seattle flight suited the hijacker).

The hijacken very carefully demanded that each and

every note either written by hin or dictated to the stewardess

by him be returned to him and he also had a used match cover

which was used to convey notes returned to him.

Stewardess

the demand notes and then went to the cockpit where she

displayed them to the

captain of the aircraft.

She thereafter

remained in the cockpit where she prepared thirteen pages of

notes concerning the hijacking.

The aircraft landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 PM, PST, at

which time $200,000. in twenty dollar bills, weighing i9 pounds,

two back chutes

and two chest chutes were given to him in a

white canvas bag.

The passengers then were allowed to deplane

as were Stewardess

and another stewardess.

The hijacker went to the lavatory just behind row

18 (the now he which he was

i sitting) and as he exited

lavatory he was seen

carrying the briefcase on its side in

both arms, with

a 12"x16"x4" light-colored package on top

of the briefcase.

Stewardess

I then acted as a communica-

tions media between the Unsub and

the captain of the air-

craft until about five minutes after the aircraft departed

the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when she was instruct-

ed to go to the cockpit by the Unsub.

The hijacker's instructions after receiving.

the money were vague.

He probably wanted to jump from the

aircraft as soon as

possible after the takeoff.

jacker put two of the parachutes, a back pack and a front

pack, on prior to take off.

also wanted the air stairs

lowered prior to takeoff, which subsequently proved to be

impossible.

Finally the hijacker Jumped as soon as practi-

al aften the stairs were lowered in flight. The hijacker

SEE

was delayed from jumping by the trouble he experienced in

lowering the air stairs

and by the fact he was not provided

a knapsack but rather a small white canvas

bag which he had

to affix to her person utilizing parachute shroud lines from

an unused parachute.

or five minutes after take-off,

was sent to the

cockpit by the hijacker. Some ten minutes after she entered

the cockpit, one of the officers received a call on the

interphone

from the hijacker, advising he could not get

the air stairs down. The pilot then leveled off the aircraft

neduced

the air

speed.

Within a very short time,

the

officer's panel showed that the stairs had been lowered

and approximately five minutes later, (8:05 PM), the officer

contacted the hijacker who said everything was okay. That was

the last communication with the hijacker.

At 8:11 PM, While the plane was at 10,000 feet, the

crew experienced a pressure bump or oscillation and the Cabir

Pressure Rate of Change Gauge also reacted violently and it

was thought, at that time, that the hijacker might have left

the aircraft.

When the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, a chest

pack chute and a back type chute were found on the plane.

The missing chest pack chute, sometimes referred to as an

emergency chute, is a training pack "dummied up" to 100k

like a good one.

The missing back pack chute is non-steerable

and anyone utilizing this type chute would have no chance of

slowing down or picking his spot on which to land.

Also located in sear 18 E of the aircraft at Reno,

was a black clip-on tie which tontained a tie clasp described

as yellow gold in color with a white pearl circular stone

in the

center.

The label in the tie bore the name

"Town-

craft" and bore Store #3, Penneys.

The label in this tie

showed it to be a

• "Snapper" patent type tie.

Investiga-

tion in Las Vegas indicated that this type sold for about

$1.50, that it was

about a year to a year and a half old,

and it was a favorite

item for individuals such as

waiters,

busboys and bartenders.

Stewardess

has said thai

this tie was probably the Unsub's and other witnesses have

indicated that he wore a similar type tie.

Located in the ashtray utilized by the Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter tip cigarettes and

The two seats which she had observed to be oc-

cupied by the unknown subject were processed for fingerprints.

In addition the telephone, the area around the rear door,

the rear door and four plastic drinking glasses found in

the trash receptacle by the back door were also processed

for fingerprints.

In addition, a cloth towel affixed to the

rear of one of the seats reportedly occupied by the unknown

subject was removed and examined by Reno Agents.

On that

towel was noted what appeared to be a short human hair.

The FBI Laboratory by communication dated Decem-

ber 9, 1971, advised that an examination of the towel sub-

mitred by the bas Vegas Office, disclosed a brown head hair

clipping and a brown limb hair, both of Caucasian origin.

The report continued that the head hain clipping is suitable

for significant comparison results, but that the limb hair

possesses to few unique microscopic characteristics to be

of value for that purpose.

sion as evidence.

It is apparent from the following excerpts,

from lops maintained by ground nersonnel on November 24,

2971, that the hijacker exited the airplane at 8:11 D.m.

local time.

When the hijacker Tumned, the air stairs were

forced closed causing an increase

in air pressure similar

to shutting a car door with the windows up. As this pressure

increase occurred the co-pilot turned to 100k at the cabin

rate of clinb meter and in doing so his communications ear

plug

was pulled from his ear.

The co-pilot's comments at this time were being

recorded on a tape recorder which had previously been started

on a time standard signal.

Through careful dlay back and

sequencing,

the time

of the pressure oscillation caused by

the air stairs closing after Unsub departed was determined

to be 8:11 p.m. local

time.

Ransom money in the amount of $200,000 was made

up entirely of used, random 20 dollar bills.

It was obtain-

ed From the seattle First National Bank, Main Office, anc

was part of a ranson package of $250,000. which had beer

maintained by the bank for such emergencies.

The package

measured approximately one foot by one foot by eight or

nine inches and weighed 19 pounds.

A check of the Federal Aviation Administration

flight section at Portland International Airport reflected

that on November 24, 1971 between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM,

there was

a ceiling of 5,000 feet, 3,500 feet broken clouds,

and at 1,500 feet scattered and broken clouds at times

with a wand of 12-14 knots.

The temperature at the end of

On October 5, 1972, Mr. DONALD W. NYROP, President,

Northwest Orient Airlines, Minneapolis-Saint Paul

Interna-

tional Airport, advised he

• authorized a finers fee of

$25,000 total reward or 15% for any portion of the ransom

money that is returned.

On 1/6/72, the NYA 727 which was actually involved

in the hijacking, was flown to seattle, by

for the purpose of conducting a test to see if the "pressure

bump" experienced during the hijacking, was caused by some-

thing leaving the aircraft.

The conclusion from that test was that the cabin

pressure change occurred when the stairs were forced upward

by the air pressure after the veirht had been removed.

according to

_, who was a member of

the hijacked crew, and also a member of the crew when

the test was performed, the occurrence was identical with

incident on the night of the hijack. Also the

instrument in the cabin which reacted so violently on

night of the hijacking, also reacted the same way when

Further house to house coverage was afforded in

an area near the midpoint of a circle specified by Northwest

Airlines as the center of the suspected area in which the

subject exited the

airplane. Every house and business

establishment in a 20 mile

area was contacted or

recontacted and it was found all individuals contacted

had information on the subject but no information of value

other than that previously reported.

On November 30, 1971, all doctors, clinics,

hospitals, and agencies which could render medical assistance

to an individual who could have broken limbs or severe

abrasions from being in a heavily wooded

area were contacted

and were also circularized with a composite photograph

and description of the subject in Clark, Lewis; Cowlitz,

Wahliakum, and Skamania Counties.

A Bonneville Power Administration helicopter and

one fixed wing aircraft upon a partial clearing of the

which has a center point of a circle as furnished by

Northwest Airlines.

The search took in an area approxi-

FIRST TERRAIN SEARCH

The purpose of the first terrain search was to

search for possible evidence left behind by Unsub and to

possible evidence

find the remains of Unsub assuming he made an unsuccessful

jump.

The first terrain search commenced at 2:00 PM on

March 21, 1972 with 218 Army troops including officers:

20 Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigatio

and 9 helicopters.

The area to

• be searched covered approxi-

mately 25 square miles.

Due to snowfall in search area on March 25, 1972,

the search was temporarily held up. Army troops remainec

on location and the search resumed at 12:00 Noon or

March 26, 1972. The search was temporarily discontinued

at 12:00 Noon March 30, 1972 to allow search personnel to

rest and enjoy the Easter Holiday.

ment was retained at search headquarters at Merwin Park.

sleet and

areas to be searched were reached only by helicopter in-

sertion of search personnel and landing zones in most

cases were under 6 to 12 inches of snow.

The search of the entire area was completed at

1:00 PM, April 17, 1972 with nothing found.

HUNTERS SEARCH

Prior to the 1972 hunting season, the following

information was made available to Washington State Game

Wardens who supervise the area into which

the hijacker

parachuted:

"On November 24, 1971, a man parachuted into the

below-described area with $200,000 in $20 bills. If, while

camping or hunting, you should discover any evidence con-

cerning this skyjacking please contact the nearest FBI

office.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

"I) The remains of a man, possibly dead for one

3) 10,000 $20 bills wrapped in a parachute

4) Deteriorated raincoat or overcoat.

5) Small briefcase or attache case.

REWARD:

results were negative.

SECOND TERRAIN SEARCH

In attempt to determine the accuracy of the first

search area, the following was learned:

The first search area was calculated using a

• system of plotting known as "GEOREE" (i.e. Geographical

Reference) which has a plotting error of plus or minus

one mile. A new plotting system using a computer generated

latitude

minus 1/2 mile.

longitude has a plotting enor of plus on

new search area is partially outside the first area. (See

maps.)

It is felt that if Unsub's parachute opened, he

is no longer in the southwest Washington area, but 1f h1:

parachute did not open he would be in a corridor along

the flight path.

The time of jump is known, and an area

approximately one mile by seven

miles represents the area

Unsub would have landed in if his parachute did not open.

Because

some of the above corridor fell in the

old or first terrain search area, only an area 2 miles by

1/2 mile was searched during the

second terrain search.

The second terrain search commenced March 12,

1973, and involved 10 Special Agents of the Seattle Office.

It was temporarily interrupted on March 16 and resumed again

March 26, 1973.

The second terrain search was completed March 29,

1973 with nothing found.

FAA RECORDS

The Seattle Division advised the Bureau by Nitel

on June 8, 1972 of the following information concerning

the Federal Aviation Administration records for licensed

pilots:

In considering the feasability of checking FAA

records for all licensed pilots, the Oklahoma City Office

has advised that FAA Aeronautical Center maintains records

of over 850,000 licensed pilots.

These records are filed

by name or license certificate number, but not by age.

Further, they do not include photographs of each licensed

pilot.

The FAA

at Oklahoma City advises that records are

permanently maintained at FAA on those pilots whose licenses

have been revoked, expired

or lapsed.

FIRST SKYJACKING UTILIZING PARACHUTES

In an effort to determine the origin of the

The below quoted newspaper article described the

first known skyjacking in which a parachute was used by

the skyjacker.

The Seattle Times, November 13, 1971:

"Calgary, Alberta - (UPI) - A masked hyjacker

carrying more than

40 pounds of dynamite was knocked un-

conscious today by an Aiy Canada crewnan wielding a fire ax.

The crewman's action 3,000 feet in the air ended a six-

hour hijacking which skipped back and forth over the United

States - Canadian border.

"The hijacker, reported in fair condition today

with a possible skull fracture, was putting on a parachute

Accordingly, weather on flight date cannot be accurately

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken then with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly contained

a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case from

the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous other

items he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to jumping,

it would fall almost

directly in the path of the aircraft.

has been suggested that infrared photography might possibly

indicate non-living material,

such as an attache case, in a

darker shade than living material, thereby enabling the

to be found using infrared high resolution photography.

Since Unsub possibly. discarded the attache case

prior to jumping, he could not have buried or hidden it.

with infrared imagery, that efforts to locate the attache case

by this means would prob bly prove futile.

The terrain, as

described, would neutralize any effort, particularly if

tall

mountains

are part of its makeup.

Further explained

was the necessity for the presence of heat which would nced

to be rencrated by the object (attache cane) in contrast io

the surrounding terrain for successful infrared high resolution

photography. The size of the attache case provides a poor

target for any type of aerial photography, including visual

photography.

All three individuals interviewed continued to

express their negative feelings as to the success of either of

the aerial photography procedures in this particular instance.

The Alexandria Division was requested to determine

the feasibility of routing a visual aerial photopraphy training

mission over the area of interest.

Alexandria advised by

airtel dated February 8,

1973, that

was contacted and he advised that

he had made inquiry into this matter and stated that in the

event Seattle wished to have military assistance in this matter

then

seattle should request the Director to submit a letter

of request to the special Assistant to the secretary of defense,

Office of the secretary of Defense,

Pentaron, Washington, D.C.

20301. In this letter the full particulars of the matter should

be set forth as well as whether or not the Bureau or Department

of Justice is willing to observe the additional cost if any

to the Air Force.

advised that he could not state

positively that the reoues: would be granted, however, advised

that it was his opinion t! t if this were to

be a reimbunsable

project, that it would probably receive more favorable action.

lowever, in any event, upon receipt or the letter a conterenc

sould be held within the appropriate military organization to

ascertain the feasibility of

such missions and the Pureau would

be properly notified.

In view of the above information no further request

was made to have a visual

aerial photography training mission

at this time.

Consideration may be given to this type of

survey if new methods or monies become available.
