IN ORDER TO SECURE MAXIMUM DISTRIBUTION OF THE SERIAL, NUMBERS

OF THE MONEY PAID IN THIS CASE,

SEATTLE TIMES, SAC CONTACI, HAS BEEN APPROACHED BY ME TO DETERMINE

IF THE PAPER WOULD BE WILLING TO PUBLISH THIS LIST.

HA'S ADVISED THAI A STUDY OF THE COST OF THIS

MATTER REVEALS THAT LABOR COSTS. IN COMPOSING WOULD RUN APPROXIMATELX

SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE NEWS PRINT COST WOULD RUN APPROXIMATELY

ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SHOULD THEY PUBLISH THIS AT THE PUBLIC

SERVICE RATE, THE COST WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND

DOLLARS AND AT THE REGULAR COMMERCIAL RATE, IT WOULD RUN APPROXI-

MATELY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. HE HAS ADVISED THAT BY PROKIDING

A PREPRINTED MAT, THE COMPOSITION COST COULD NOT BE ELIMINATED

SINCE THEIR UNION CONTRACT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE COST BE PAID

NONETHELESS.

HAS INQUIRED IF THE BUREAU WOULD BE

WILLING TO PAY THE ACTUAL COST UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED FOR PUBLISHING

OF THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, HAS

ALSO BEEN APPROACHED BY ME CONCERNING THIS MATTER BUT HAS NOT

RESPONDED THUS FAR TO MY INQUIRY.

I KNOW OF NO WAY WHERE THE LIST COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO

AS MANY PEOPLE AS PUBLICATION THROUGH A DAILY NEWSPAPER. THE

SEATTLE TIMES CIRCULATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, ITS

PRINCIPAL CIRCULATION AREA BEING THE SEATILE METROPOLITAN AREA.

IN THE EVENT MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNIQUE IS TO BE OBTAINED!

THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THE SAME STEPS BE TAKEN BY A DAILY NEWSPAPER

IN PORTLAND, SACRAMENTO, SAN FRANCISCO AND POSSIBLY RENO, NEVADA.

BUREAU IS REQUESTED TO ADVISE IF IT WOULD AUTHORIZE THES

EXPENDITURE OF UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PUBLICATION OF THIS

Re Seattle letter 12/13/71 transmitting copy

of a letter received by the managing editor of the

SEATTLE TIMES On 12/13/71, signed "D. B. COOPER."

On 12/14/71 SA BOB MATHESON called from the

Bureau. He advised that the UPI carried an article today

concerning a letter received by the LOS ANGELES TIMES; and

wanted to know where the original of this letter could be

located since Los Angeles advised they had a copy.

I told him that the SEATTLE TIMES likewise re-

ceived a copy, as did the WASHINGTON POST and the NEW YORK

TIMES, and that we had sent a wixe to Los Angeles, New

York and WO to get the copy

While talking to SA MATHESON, I called

Jat the SEATTLE IIMES, who had furnished the letter

originally and he said he had given us everything they

received.

I advised MATHESON that I suspected that very

likely the original was still in the hands of the

writer.

a chartered helicopter can result in economies far ex-

ceeding the charter cost.

A helicopter can also be in-

valuable for searches

or surveillance operations.

We have two types of helicopter available for your

charter.

The Hughes 300 is a small two passenger

machine

that is ideal for beating the ferry scheduled

cruises at 80 MPH and charters for $15 'der hour.

longer distances and when you are in a real hurry, our

Hughes 500 turbine powered

helicopter is the answer.

It carries four passengers at 140 MPH cruise for $225

In reference to the recent hijacking committed by

(D. Cooper) I've been reading various news articles and I believe

I've discovered something of value. Consider the enclosed news-

paper clippings. There is a definite resemblance between the

photo of John E. List and the artist conception of D. Cooper.

It would seem that Mr. List has the type of grooming,

background and intelligence that has been desdribed by witnesses

in the hijacking incident. Also, Mr. List would have the motive

because if he were killed during the hijacking, he would have

nothing to lose since he had already murdered his family. It

is suspected in both cases that each man, has left the country.

Sirs,

I new from the start that I nouldn't be caught.

I didn't rob Northwest Orient because I thought it

would be romantic, heroic of any of the other euphemisus

that seem to attach themselves to situations of high

I'I no modern day Robin Hood. Unfortunately do have

• only 14 months to live.

My life has been one of hate, turmoil, hunger and more

hate, this seemed to be the fastest and nost profitable

way to gain a few fast grains of peaco of ainà.

I don't blave people for hating re for what I've done

nor do i blame anybody for wanting me to be caught and

punished, though this can never happen,

Here are some (not all) of the things working against

the authoritles:

I'e not a boasting nan

lift no fingerprints

wore a toupee

I wore putty make-up

They could add or subtract from the composite a hundred

times and not come up with an accurate description; and

we both know It.

I've cone and gone on several airline flights already

and an not holed up in some obsure backwoods town.

Neither am I a psycho-pathic killer. As a matter of

fact I've never even recelved a speeding ticket.

Thank you for your attention.

The U. S, Parachute Association has divided the

He further indicated that he firmly believed that

If this had been a skydiver who committed the hijacking, the

skydiver would not have come fron the Northwest section of the

United States.

He believed that since most skydivers know each

other in a section of the country, this would preclude it being

an individunl from that section of tho country.

advised the jump from 10,000 fcct in

bad weather is not a great physical feat and there would be no

problem in jumping at that altitude in bad weather,

He advised

that an individual would not need jump boots and stated that

he, hinself,has skydived with tennis shoes 'on.

further stated that whoever set up the hijacking

further indicated that probably the reason behind tho four

parachutes given to the hijacker was that the hijacker wanted

to test the good faith of the people on the ground inasnuch as

a skydiver would be able to tell whether or not parachutes were

operable.

He further indicated that if two parachutes were left

behind in the aircraft, the hijacker could have dropped one

'chutc:and activated it as a decoy to ward off any trailing-air-

craft, and then could have bailed out after the decoy 'chute was

dropped,

advised that if the hijacker pere

knowledgoable in flying and skydiving, he could have checked

with the Portland, Seattlo or Reno Weather Bureau a day or two

before his feat concerning the weather forecast along the

routo, If a pilot is about to take a cross-country, he would

normally check the weather bureau by indicating his

nano and

aircraft nunber to the weather bureau in order that this infor-

possibility that soncone could havo checked the weather on a
