Dear Sir,

пою trom

This is in regard to the " D.B. Cooper " case. You have received by

Portland Office) my offer to duplicate the jump

from the 727.

I know of course you will weigh the facts and decide whether it will

be feasible and worthonile.

I would appreciate this opportunity to say why I think it night

be of help. In the first place it will prove within reasonable doubt

whether "Cooper is alive or not", and by the way, I will sign a release

that the 739 or airlines will not be responsible for anything that

may happer to me. Hlso, the more facts you can accusilate fron my juri

will help you in preventing juture attempts. I've noticed recently that

the 747 Junbo jet has a adequate exit door at the near that clears the

taib stabalizers and other obstacles. I have no idea how slow a 747

can be flown but who knous the possibilities of jumping from the 747 or

other jets?

If we were to duplicate "Coopers" jurp, that is altitude, speed,

flight plan, weather conditions, etc, it seems to me that this north

would be a good time, at least for the same temperatures and overcast.

February is usually a "fair" but cold morth, but March could be a

possibility also. And it, we were to take off from Seattle, fly to

10,000 ft., open the rear door over Woodland and then see how long ?

can stand that 7 degree temperature before I have to jump, this would

give you a fair idea of at least where he might have jurped. My own

opinion as a jumper tells me he didn't jump over Woodland because the

terrain is very bad for a daylight jurp, and twice as hazardous at nite.

9 believe he jumped somenhere in the Willanette Valley..

I would carry a C.B3. radio and other pertinent equip. for the jump

and I would make it as safe as possible.

Also there is another aspect of this jump and related activities that

may even draw Cooper into the open (even though he may have been disquised)

I am takin

in Portland from

suggested ve arrange

demonstration before

or after the jump, and when "Cooper" finds out who I an he may even be there.

I have arranged with a reporter from the Oregon Journal,

to publicize this jump so "Cooper" vill be informed of tt. It may be a long

shot but what else have you got to go on?

Well, thank you for your time and attention, I hopeI may be of some

UTILIZATION OF MILITARY

AIRCRAFT IN BUREAU CASES

PERSONAL ATTENTION

JuB-S!

In connection with a recent aircraft hijacking,

inquiries were made concerning the use of military aircraft to

assist in a search. The question of reimbursement was raised.

This matter has been discussed with the Department of Defense

(DOD) .

Advice has been received from DOD that military air-

craft may be utilized for non-DOD purposes only when: (1) their

movement is pursuant to an emergency involving imminent loss of

life; (2) is specifically authorized by statute; (3) is in

direct support of the military mission; or (4) is certified

by

the head of a Federal department or agency to be in the national

interest and commercial transportation is not available. This

is set forth 'in Department of Defense Directive #4500.9, dated

November 29, 1971.

According to DOD, Section 686 of Title 31, U. S. Code,

'reguires in every instance

the DOD be reimbursed for the total

costs involved in the utilization by any other Federal agency

of any aircraft or equipment made available to such agency for

. use in connection with its own investigation.

The Department

of Defense further advised should any requirements in connection

with our investigations develop which come within the above

guidelines, DOD will consider them on a case-by-case basis.

DOD furnished the hourly rates for the most commonly

: used aircraft.

These fates are set forth as follows:

have been

interviewed at the St. Francis Hotel, Susanville, California.

Both persons stated that the man who was in the bar at the

St. Francis Cafe and at the State Cafe on the evening of

11/28/71 displaying a large number of bills and attempting

to get someone to drive him out of town departing in a white

sedan, but neither could establish the make or model estimating

a 1965 Chevrolet.

advised the license number

was written down by an unrecalled bar patron and was handed

to him on a slip of paper.

The composite photograph of unknown subject was

displayed to L

who they observed on the evening of 11/28/71 do not at all

resemble the composite. They both stated that the individual

they had been describing very much looked like an Indian

possibly the individual who was suspected as being

UNSUB possibly was flashing a large amount of money

attempting to cause the other bar patron to believe

he was the UNSUB as the case had received considerable

press coverage in te area.

Inasmuch as composite does not resemble

## Page 225

For the second time in less than

a week a CAB hearing examiner sup-

ported a position long urged by ALPA

and recommended sweeping changes

in the lober protective conditions tra-

ditionally imposed in merger cases.

(PILOT BULLETIN, November, page

1). In his recommended decision

approving the Allegheny-Mohowk

merger, Examiner Merrite Ruhlen ro-

jested the position of the carriers that

the so-called "standard" provisions

first imposed in the United-Capital

merger case over a decade ago should

be imposed again without change.

Addressing himself directly to the

changes in the provisions recommended

by ALPA, Ruhlen wrote. "Il is nec-

essary to consider the suggested

changes on their merits rather than to

rely on a decision of 10 years ago

made in a different economic climate

upon a different factual basis."

Ruhlen's recommended decision

'endorsed the following changes in the

standard provisions urged by ALPA:

ALLECIENY - MOHAWK LABOR C'OTECTIVE

PROVISIONS RECOMMENDED

(1) A shifting of the burden of

, proof under the United-Capital for-

mula so that a claiming employe would

be required to do nothing more than

show that a merger occurred and that

his condition of employment changed

adversely,

Should the employer con-

tend that the change was the result of

some factor other than the merger, the

burden would be on the employer to

establish that contention through the

production of evidence. (Under the

United-Capital formula, an employe

must carry the virtually impossible

burden of showing that his change in

employment was coused "solely" by

the merger and no other couse.)

(2) A change in the compensation

for a displaced employe to include

average compensation during the base

period plus "subsequent wage increases"

for the duration of the protection per-

iod. (United-Copital exeluded all

such increases.)

(3) A change in the base period

used for determining average compen-

Examiner Ruhlen's decision is now

subject to review and amendment by

the full CAB as well as final approval

by President Nixon before it may toke

effect. ALPA attorneys hove filed

briefs in both the Delta-Northeast

and Allegheny-Mohowk merger cases

urging that the specific differences of

the alteration in labor protective pro-

visions recommended by the two hear-

ing examiners be rationalized in such

a manner as to preserve the most sub-
