three statute miles east northeast of Lacenter, Washington.

He said the center of

the circle would depend on the clock being a few seconds

off one way or the other or the Unsub falling free before

he opened the chute.

However, he would estimate that a

circle with a three-mile radius from the point described

above should come close to the place of descent.

He called back subsequently and said that he had

talked to the man who was working the radar at Portland

which was very accurate since it was very close to the

plane at the time and determined that the plane was actually

one to two miles east of the center of this particular

fly-way:.

He said for this reason, we might consider

particular

moving the center of the circle described above one or

two miles due east.

This information was furnished to SA MANNING on

THIS PARTICULAR PARACHUTE, ACCORDING TO COSSEY, IS ONE OF

THE TWO CHEST PACK PARACHUTES THAT WERE DELIVERED TO THE WASHINGTON

STATE PATROL FOR DELIVERY TO THE NORTHWEST AIRLINES FOR DELIVERY

TO THE HIJACKER.

SINCE FOUR PARACHUTES WERE GIVEN ID THE HIJACKER, TWO CHEST

at the Bureau called. He advised that the UPI, AP and many

of the eastern newspapers were carrying stories in this

matter, quoting SA MANNING, the Agent in charge at the search

I told him that

teletype and I did not offer one.

I told him, however,

that MANNING had been told not to make any remarks to the

press and that the remarks described by him were common

among the law enforcement officials and that the

Sheriffs from Clark and Cowlitz had been interviewed

extensively by the press, and that I was certain that MANNING

had made no such remarks.

He requested a teletype about it.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of tronscription.

11/29/71

EARL J. COSSEY, 349 North 10lst, Seattle, telephone

SU3-0475, appeared at the Seattle Office at which time he

furnished the following information:

He is a master parachute rigger and jump instructor

at Seattle Sky Sports, Issaguah, Washington, telephone

EX2-3050.

In May, 1971,

Washington,

packed two parachutes which were furnished to L

vice tunts parachutes, co

_ COSSEY

or about May I

1971. He described these parachutes as

back packs, commonly referred to as "emergency" parachutes.

He also packed the two chest pack parachutes which were

furnished to Northwest Airlines on November 24, 1971.

b6

b7C

The two parachutes recovered from the Northwest

Airlines flight 305 at

Reno, Nevada, on November 24, 1971,

he

sage green nylon harness, which harness has no "D" rings

to mount a chest pack.

The parachute is a 28 foot nylon

white flat circular with a specially fitted foam padded

cushion.

The pilot chute is also white.

MI. COSSEY said that the missing chest pack para-

chute is a ground training pack dummied up to look like a

good one.

He said that by "dummied up" he means that tie

downs were attached to the container.

This chest pack

was devised by COSSEY to teach trainees while hung in a

harness how to open the chest pack in the event of an

emergency. The folds of the parachute are sewen together

to preclude the parachute opening in the training room.

Mr. COSSEY said that the back packs furnished the hijacker

did not have the necessary hooks on the harness to attach

a chest pack.

Mr. COSSEY said that if the hijacker opened one

of the chest packs on the airplane he probably would

remove the parachute and put the money" in the chest pack

as it would be impossible to hold anything in his hand

when the parachute opened.

Mr. COSSEY said it would

be quite possible to parachute from a 727 jet if the jet

was below 10,000 feet

and flying at a very slow rate of

speed.

The person jumping from the plane would have to

free fall to earth for several thousand feet to slow

himself down and get himself in position for the back

pack to open. Even an experienced parachutist would

experience considerable shock from the shute opening,

however, this would cause little or no personal injury.

He said that anyone who had six or seven practice jumps

could accomplish this as the first five jumps would be

on a static line and the subsequent jumps would be free

fall.

He said that jumping

at night materially increases

the chance of injury and in this case he would consider

the parachutists chances of not being injured as "nill."

Mr. COSSEY said the back pack used by the hijacker is

non-steerable and he would have no chance of slowing down

or picking the spot on which to land.

Also at night he

would be unable to gauge his distance to the ground which

would result in a much harder impact.

It was his opinion

the skyjacker would suffer severe ankle and or leg injuries

fron this jump.

Mr. COSSEY said that the fact the hijacker wore

street shoes would

also increase the chance that he would

be injured on landing

as the most experienced jumpers

wear jump boots or some rigid ankle support.

Ir. COSSEY expressed the opinion that the pilo

of the jet would notice some oscillation when the hitacke:

departed the rear of the aircraft.

unable to furnish

any particulars about the hijacker's eyes.

(contacted 11/29/71), of

Seattle, was

displayed an artist's conception of the

hijacker.

After studying the artist's sketch,

made the following comments.

He stated that the hijacker had an over-all

appearance which was in some ways similar to the artist's

sketch; however, he recalled that the hijacker had a broader

nose, wider forehead and face in general, than that depicted

in the sketch.

He also noted that the hijacker's hairline

was somewhat lower than the sketch and the hijacker's glasses

had squarer corners than the round corners or cornered glasses

depicted in the Sketch. )

REMYTEL TODAY.

RE: ARTIST'S SKETCH.

THE FOLLOWING WERE PASSENGERS AND WITNESSES WHO

OBSERVED UNSUB ON CAPTIONED AIRPLANE.

WASHINGTON, STATED

THAT CONCERNING THE EXES, THE EYES APPEARING IN PHOTO

O B SEVEN DASH TWELVE, PAGE TWENTYNINE, WITH HEAVY LIDS AS

APPEARING IN PHOTO O B EIGHT DASH TWELVE, PAGE THIRTYONE,

WERE SIMILAR TO UNSUB. CONCERNING THE REMAINDER OF THE

SKETCH,

HAD THE FOLLOWING TO SAY: THE HAIRLINE WAS

GOOD. HAIR ITSELF SHOULD BE MARCELLED AND HAIR STYLE OF

PRESIDENT NIXON IS QUITE SIMILAR TO WHAT UNSUB HAD. HAIR

SHOULD BE SLICKED DOWN AS CHARACTERS WORE IN OLD GEORGE RAFT

MOVIES. NOSE IN ARTIST'S CONCEPTION TOO PINCHED, SHOULD BE

BROADENED IN AREA OF NOSTRILS. CHEEKS TOO FLAT, SHOULD BE

MORE ROUNDED TO GIVE MEXICAN-AMERICAN APPEARANCE. CHIN AREA

GOOD.

SEATTLE, ADVISED

THE HIJACKER WAS WEARING DARK GLASSES WHEN

SAW HIM AND HE WAS UNABLE TO FURNISH ANY PARTICULARS

ABOUT THE HIJACKERS EYES. AFTER STUDYING THE ARTIST'S

SKETCH OF THE HIJACKER,

MADE THE FOLLOWING

COMMENTS. HE STATED THAT THE HIJACKER HAD AN OVERALI

APPEARANCE WHICH WAS IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO THE ARTIST'S

SKETCH, HOWEVER, HE RECALLED THAT THE HIJACKER HAD A

BROADER NOSE, WIDER FOREHEAD AND FACE IN GENERAL, THAN THAT

DEPICTED IN THE SKETCH. HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE HIJACKERS'

HAIRLINE WAS SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THE SKETCH AND THE HIJACKER'S

GLASSES HAD SQUARER CORNERS THAN THE ROUND CORNERED GLASSES

DEPICTED IN THE SKETCH.

Dear Sir:

Now that most of the facts are in concerning last Wednesday's

Skyjacking are in, one thing is very apparent: If this one is suc-

cessful, we can expect others to follow. In any case, this was a

unique method.

When I heard the hijacker requested

and got parachutes, I sur-

mised they might be rigged so they wouldn't open. But no,

might make a hostage jump with him. Then I began thinking "if I were

dealing with a hijacker and he requested

two parachutes, what would

how hard it is to locate a small plane that has crashed, there was

an outfit on the nightly news telling about an emergency transmitter

in a little plastic case which sent continuous signals to help locate

a downed craft. Why couldn't a smart guy stuff one of these into a

parachute case?

A little afterthought, though it doesn't mean a damn thing, is this

caper must have been pretty well planned, right? It has been spec-

ulated the hijacker must have had someone waiting to, pick him up.

parachuting is a fast way to come down, but not too accurate. If

our man jumped in cowlitz county, chances are he had a rough time of it.

(I know the area) I'd be willing to bet that if he jumped in the

area between Woodland and Portland, it was probably over one of the

few islands in the Columbia River near the Portland Airport.

a couple of them are big

enough to hit and uninhabited, too. Then

he could leave quietly by boat.

I really don't know why I'm writing this except I have nothing

better to do at the moment. You guys probably have already thought of

all these things, anyway, On well, this can be your daily crakpot

letter for whichever day it comes on.

Minneapolis, called

on 11/29/71.

1. He said that 90% of the skydivers are licensed

by the U.S. Parachute Association, P.O. Box 109, Monterey,

California. The license has a photograph of the individual;

however, he does not believe that the association maintains

these photos although they do maintain descriptions.

2.

Northwest people have discussed this jump with a

pilot who has made 500 parachute jumps, including two at

night.

He said that with a lighted target, a man could

come within 1000 feet of the target from the height that they

were flying on the night in question, and that you could

guide yourself as much as 45 degrees

in either direction with

a plain survival type parachute, if you had the knowledge.

He stated that theyhave been passing information

on to us based on the "pressure bump" indicating that the

man had jumped north of Portland. He said it was entirely

possible that the man did not jump when this "pressure bump"

took place.

It was entirely possible that he sat on the

end of the stairs to check out his reference points before

he jumped.

If he did this for even a short time, he could

have easily landed across the river in Oregon.

He pointed out in this connection that there is

The Bureau is preparing a circular

for field-wide circularization concerning captioned case and

will include an artist's conception of the hijacker. The Bureau

has been asked to prepare a sketch

showing the unknown subject

without glasses. Additional distribution will be made from

time to time to parachute clubs, flight instruction schools and

airports, etc., in an effort to

identify the unknown subject

which undoubtedly will result in various field divisions receiving

calls on this case.

For the assistance of all offices in conducting

investigation and to evaluate complaints from citizens, the

following information is furnished:

The unknown subject boarded captioned flight at

Portland, Oregon, using the name DAN COOPER. As the plane

was taxiing toward the runway, Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved for the stewardesses on the right

side of the plane and behind the last row of passenger seats.

The unknown subject, who occupied the center seat in the last

row of three seats, turned and handed her an envelope

which she did not open for a few minutes until he glanced

at her several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said: "Miss - I have a bomb here

and I would like you to sit by me."

be able to recognize this individual if she saw him again. She

advised that the suitcase was the only thing he was carrying

information concerning the events prior to the hijacking of

Northwest Flight 305 from Portland,, Oregon, to Seattle,

Washington, on November 24, 1971:

He was on duty

for Flight 305

on November 24, 1971.

He could not recognize any of the

passengers by name, as he handles on a daily basis thousands

of nanes.

However, he remembers one particular individual who

stood out in his mind. It was raining at the airport that date

and all the passengers were making comments and jokingly stating

were going to have to run through a great deal of rain in

order to board Flight 305 to Seattle. The only individual who

was not mixing with other passengers and joking about the rain

a man whom he described as a white male,

age 50, height

6'1" plus, 175 to 180 lbs., slender build, with black wavy hair,

smartly dressed, wearing a black raincoat

and carrying a black

attache case.

attitude and was quite unaffected by the inclement weather

conditions prevailing at the time, which
