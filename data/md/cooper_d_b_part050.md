Skyjacker's fate still debated 20 years later

By Hal Spencer

The Assoclated Press

SEATTLE - Yesterday was D.B. Cooper's

20th anniversary. But was it the 20th year of the

legendary skyjacker's death or 20 years since he

began a new life with a bagful of stolen green-

backs?

As is their annual custom, Cooper fans from

Seattle to San Jose, Calif., to Salt Lake City organ-

ized celebrations to honor their hero, who they

believe melted into society after committing the

perfect crime - parachuting from an airliner

over Washington state with $200,000 in ransom

money on Nov. 24, 1971.

Two decades after the unique exploit, which a

retired FBI agent calls stupid and alroost certainly

fatal, Cooper's real identity is still a mystery. No-

body knows if he's a pile of bleached bones in the

mountains of Washington or the guy next door.

Cooper's crime seems almost quaint in

today's violent world. And his $200,000 in marked

money would hardly make him a rich man.

The story began Thanksgiving eve, when a

man wearing dark glasses boarded a Northwest-

Orient Airlines Boeing 727 at Portland Interna-

tional Airport. He used the name Dan Cooper to

purchase his plane ticket. The name became pop-

ularized as D.B, Cooper after a law enforcement

official erroneously referred to him that way.

Once airborne, "Cooper" handed the stew-

ardess a note saying he had a dynamite bomb in

his attache case. The man, who chain-smoked Ra-

leigh filter-tipped cigarettes and who appeared to

be in his middle to late 40s, demanded $200,000 in

used $20 bills.

He collected the money - provided by the

airline - during a brief stop at Seattle-Tacoma

International Airport, where the 36 passengers

were released and the four crew members were

kept aboard.

Airborne again, Cooper parachuted into a

freezing rainstorm at 10,000 feet near tiny Ariel in

southwestern Washington, wearing only a busi-

ness suit and loafers. The temperature was 7

below zero, not counting the wind chill factor at

the plane's speed of 200 mph.

"It was obviously not well-thought-out.... It

was stupld," said Ralph Himmelsbach, the retired

on 1/7-9/91 the Newark Division case agent, who is also a

bureau pilot, reviewed all the original files in regard to this

matter at FBIHQ.

These files contained extensive information

regarding the characteristics and physical abilities of the

unsub, as well as an excellent re-construction of the route of

the aircraft when it was hi-jacked and the most probable point

where the hi-jack bailed out with the money.

The geographic and

local maps in the file indicate that the most probable point of

bail out was in Clark County, Washington, just southeast of La

Center, Washington.

It is noted that when a pilot's aeronautical chart is

superimposed over this area, the point of bail out is in

extremely close proximity to the "Portland Vortac" which is used

for aircraft navigation.

•It is further noted that Battleground,

Washington is less that five miles from the "Portland Vortac".

As noted above,

She has only met the individual known to her as

ROBERT ROBERTS, aka Bob, on one occasion. However, she has had

several telephonic conversations with him. He resides in a house

on Arnold Street, Centerville, Tennessee. She believes ROBERTS

has lived in Centerville approximately 18 months.

She had a

ROBERTS apparently got

he was calling the girlfriend:

This would have been several

Through her telephonic conversations with ROBERTS,

Centerville,

Tennessee,

from California.

He was divorced from

his wife and family.

He appeared to be agitated about the

divorce and ROBERTS

had moved to Tennessee.

divorced him.

on one occasion, he even claimed he had

$200,000.00 that he could not touch and

could not use the money.

However, ROBERTS was always coming up with some wild story and

She had read the book about D. B. COOPER and his

There is no arrest

record for ROBERI I. ROBERTS at the CENTERVILLE POLICE

DEPARTMENT.

However, one of the Centerville detectives is

familiar with ROBERTS.

ROBERTS has been classified as a

"grouchy" elderly individual around 70 years of age, apparently

no meaningful employment, and is believed to be possibly

retired from the military.

He apparently came to Centerville two

or three years ago but little else is known about his background.

The

Discover y

of

D. B.Cooper

by Byron H. Brown

*-.

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION: Las Vegas has never been associated

with the most famous skyjacking in American history, but in the 1970's an

investigation of incredible dimensions was centered in this gambling

capitol, one which led to the identification of the legendary Northwest sky-

-jacker D.B. Cooper, Conduced by a unique pair of characters-an

unemployed aircraft engineer and his son, who was an investigative

reporter and freelance writer here-the investigation shattered the myth

surrounding the D.B. Cooper affair and in striking fashion exposed many

obscure, never-before-revealed facets of the famous skyjacking, causing

one local FBI agent to admit to the two: "You have accomplished the im-

possible.

In 1975, freelance journalist Byron Brown met a 'Hollywood producer

who was in Las Vegas to film a sporting event for CBS television, and in-

terested him in the idea of making a movie about a bizarre journey he had

taken the year before with his father and an old prison buddy of his—-a man

who claimed to be the legendary D.B. Cooper. Before long Byron was

traveling regularly to Los Angeles to assist in the development of a movie

script and to engage in meetings with motion picture executives. Strategy

sessions in Las Vegas nightspots resulted in his going on the road to

develop leads and uncover major evidence.

As a native of the Pacific Northwest, I have always been intrigued by the

famous skyjacking. Even in Nevada, people instantly recognize the ame

D.B. Cooper and comment upon the veil of mystery surrounding the

crime. Las Vegas, the pre-eminent city of gamblers, obviously appreciates

one of fis kind: a man who forced the odds to turn in his favor when the

chips were down So when I first met Byron Brown (ironically, not long

after I had seen the movie In Pursui of D.B. *Cooper), I began to realize

thát he had, in tac, uncovered the truth about Cooper and also stumbled

upon one of the most exciting stories ever. to come across my desk. His

sincerity and the massive documentation he showed me he has the only

known photographs of the man now identified

as D.B. Cooper, which will be published in

Las Vegan's November issue-convinced me

that he had spent many years professionally

restarching and investigating obscure leads

and myriad new facts about the skyjacking.

Byron, then completing his book on the sub-

ject, was hesitant to share his information at

first, but my inquisitiveness about the famous

criminal prompted him to begin work on this

exclusive two-part series for Las Vegan.

The D.B. Cooper matter is a complex and

serious one. Shortly after the skyjacking, FBI

agents in charge of the investigation concluded

that Cooper had probably died in his extraor-

dinary leap from the commercial airliner. But

to be on the safe side, in 1976 the U.S. Justice

Department issued a re-indictment of Cooper

in Portland, Oregon,

which effectively

nullified any statute-of-limitations on the

crime. Technically, therefore, Cooper still

may be prosecuted, so the FBI has never clos-

ed its file on the case.

Las Vegan Magazine is proud to present this

previously unreported evidence in the amazing

story which begins in the following report.

JES

THE CRIME

note in a sealed envelope, but Florence is an

attractive young woman and was used to male

passengers making passes at her, so she put the

note in her handbag without reading it and

began serving other passengers. Suddenly,

Cooper called out to her in an angry voice,

"Miss, I want you to read that note!"

She opened the envelope distractedly, and

was suddenly faced with the awesome message

- written in block capitals on a single sheet of

paper - "MISS-I HAVE A BOMB IN MY

BRIEFCASE AND I WANT YOU TO SIT

BESIDE ME."

"Oh, no!" she thought, trying to compre-

hend the words.

"You"re kidding,"

she

stammered to him, "are you kidding?" He

was not.

"You better sit down right now,"' he threat-

ened. From his window seat he grabbed her

hand and pulled her into the aisle seat. Then he

opened the briefcase in the seat between them

and showed her a large battery, some wiring,

and several reddish-brown sticks bundled to-

gether which he claimed were dynamite. "All

I have to do is touch these two wires together

and it's all over," he said.

Tate afterioon on thanksgiving Eve, Noy-

in from the Pacific coast, Northwest Orient

Flight 305 was preparing for take-off to Seattle.

The plane, a three-engine Boeing 727, had left

Washington D.C. earlier in the day, making a

series of hops across the country before arriving

in Portland. So far it had been a routine flight.

Among the young anti-

establishment crowd, Cooper

became a heroic symbol of

rebellion: he had successfully

stuck it to Northwest Airlines,

the banks and insurance

companies, and also

thumbed his nose at the FBI.

But at the Portland terminal a man who

signed his name as Dan Cooper and paid cash

for his ticket to Seattle was causing a delay.

Standing by the terminal windows, he was

Seattle at 5:40 PM, but the ransom was still

not collected.

"Impress on this man that we are not trying to

PM the money and parachutes arrived, but

Cooper was outraged that the ransom had been

placed in a mail sack instead of a backpack.

"Screw me one more time and you're a dead

intercom. Nevertheless, he allowed the thirty-

six passengers and two of the stewardesses —

Schaffner and Alice Hancock - to leave the

its task. He suspected a set-up. "I know exactly

how long it takes to fuel this plane!" he barked

over the intercom. "Let's get this motherf

show on the road!" Finally, at 7:36 PM the

727 took off again. Cooper had demanded to

be flown to Mexico City, but Captain Scott

pointed out to him that Mexico was beyond the

range of the aircraft, so there would have to be

another refueling stop. After a series of ex-

changes with Northwest Flight Control in

Minneapolis, Scott was given three alternatives:

Reno, Phoenix, and "somewhere in between"

- which had to be Las Vegas. Cooper chose

Reno. There, three and a half hours after

leaving Seattle, the plane landed. Since the

crew had not heard from Cooper over the

interphone in over three hours (Tina Mucklow

was ordered into the cockpit by him shortly

after take-off from Seattle), FBI agents, airport

security personnel, and police warily closed in

on the plane, firing a barrage of tear-gas can-

nisters into the back. But Cooper, the money,

the briefcase with the bomb, and two of the

four parachutes were gone. D.B. Cooper -

the name the press gave him, and the one that

stuck - had gotten clean away.

"D.B. Cooper, Where Are You?" de-

manded the bumper stickers. "D.B. Cooper,

We Love You"' proclaimed the T-shins.

There was a whimsical cartoon book about

him: Skyjacker's Guide - Or Please Hold

This Bomb While 1 Go To The Bathroom. In

Seattle for a while there was even a D.B.

Cooper Discotheque where patrons danced

"the skyjack." Ameng:-the young anti-

establishment crowd, Cooper became a heroic

symbol of rebellion: he had successfully stuck

it to Northwest Airlines, the banks and insur-

ance companies, and also thumbed his nose at

But many people, particularly FBI agents

involved in the case, believed that Cooper died

in the jump. "What we're looking for is a hole

in the ground," said one agent. Their suspi-

cions were bolstered by the fact that one of the

chest packs Cooper was given turned out to be

a sewn-up dummy chute used for classroom

demonstration — according to George Harrison,

who was Seattle transport manager for North-

west Airlines at the time. Also, if Cooper had

survived the jump he was obviously in no hurry

to spend the money. Not one of the $20 bills he

had received - all the serial numbers had been

recorded - ever turned up until a small bundle

of Cooper's loot was discovered by a young

Oklahoma boy, Brian Ingram, on the banks of

the Columbia River nine miles north of Portland

in February 1980. The FBI interpreted this

find as proof that Cooper died in the jump, but

they had trouble accounting for why this small

bundle of money ended up in a place ten miles

upstream from the place they have always

maintained he jumped out - the area around

the town of Woodland, Washington.

According to the crew of the plane, a series

of strong "pressure bumps" occurred directly

over this area of broad, flat farming country

about twenty miles north of Portland, which

seemed the most likely place for him to have

jumped. Local authorities, familiar with the

geography, doubted that he jumped much far-

ther south. To do so would run the risk of

bailing out into the cold, rugged, densely-

forested Cascades, which were already thinly

covered with snow. Survival there in street

clothes would be nearly impossible, especially

since the Cascades had been hit by fierce

storms the night of the skyjacking. On the basis

of the crew's information, a massive search

was mounted. The day after Thanksgiving,

when the weather cleared, a horde of official

searchers invaded the Woodland area. FBI

agents, local sheriffs and deputies, local police

and Boy Scout troups, assisted by helicopters

provided by the Army and Weyerhauser

Lumber Company, searched exhaustively. But

they found nothing. In the spring another search

was conducted, this time by nearly three hun-

dred soldiers from Fort Lewis, Washington.

They too found nothing. It seemed that D.B.

Cooper had disappeared forever.

'Well, I'm Cooper," he said, thumping his chest with his forefinger. "I'm D.B. Cooper!"

As soon as the plane was in

the air, Cooper pushed the

stewardess call button and

ordered a bourbon. When

Florence Schaffner brought it

to him, she was puzzled that

he was wearing a pair of

white gloves.

THE REVELATION

at now the mystery may be over. A Con

fession, two eye-witnesses, and a mass of

circumstantial evidence indicate that a man

known to many as Bryant "Jack" Coffelt once

committed a crime of such daring that it cap-

tured the imagination of a nation.

The story I related to the producer in Las

Vegas was this: In 1974, when I was 16, my

father asked me to join him on a camping ex-

pedition to the Cascade Mountains of Oregon

with an old friend of his, ostensibly so that we

would have a chance to look over towns where

I might decide to go to college. My father had

been having a lot of trouble lately at a small

beer and wine store that he ran. Recently, a

county grand jury had revoked the store's

license because of the many disturbances that

occurted there, so my father had picnty of

time on his hands to take this much-needed

vacation. "Hell, I might want to move out

there myself,"' he said, "if I can put together a

little money."

We started out from our home in northeast

Georgia, our truck-camper rig loaded with

hiking gear, on the thousand-mile trip to Joplin,

Missouri, where we were to mect his old friend.

It was the third week in June. We met Jack

Coffelt in Joplin as night was falling, and

immediately proceeded to a seedy motel on the

outskirts of town where we took a room for the

night. In the small room, with a dim lamp il-

luminating his face, Jack Coffelt looked me

steadily in the eye and asked suspiciously,

"Byron, you remember that fella that sky-

jacked that airplane out in Oregon a few years

back? - Cooper, D.B. Cooper? You remem-

ber him?"

"Sure," I replied, "All my friends at school

were talking about that for weeks after it

happened." I thought he would tell me we

were going to look for Cooper.

"Well, I'm Cooper," he said, thumping his

chest with his forefinger. "I'm D.B. Cooper!"

He gave me no time to think. "I need your

help, Byron. I lost my goddam money! I

dropped it when the parachute opened. Your

father has promised to help, but we need your

help too." He could see that I was dumb-

founded. His and my father's eyes fell steadily

upon me. "The bastards tried to kill me,"

cried Coffelt. "Gave me a rotten chute - no

good. It wouldn't open. I kept clawing at it but

it wouldn't open. Finaily I got the other one

open - the back pack - but it jolted me so

bad I dropped the money! I dropped the bag of

moncy!" The words echoed pitifully through

the small room as Coffel: buried his head in his

hands.

"Will you help me?" he pleaded. "You're

young; we're just two old men. You can climb

the mountains out there. I'm gonna give your

daddy half, and we're going to buy you a brand

new car."' He hoisted his shorts and showed

me his legs all the way up to the thighs. They

were horribly discolored - purple and yellow-

ish bruises blending with the pale skin. He

claimed he had hit a tree limb between his legs

when he crashed down on a rugged mountain

slope in the dark. His shoes had filled with

blood; he had broken a rib. "I've never re-

covered," he gasped. "It ruined me. I

wouldn't do it again for a million dollars."

I was astounded by his allegations, and as I

retold them over a year later they seemed as

outlandish as they had that night in the Joplin

motel. But the allegations would grow im-

mensely. In one meeting at the Tropicana Hotel

with writers and executives of Universal

Studios, I told how Coffelt claimed he had

"connections" in Las Vegas, that these persons

were going to help him launder that stolen loot

through the casino cage of one major Strip

hotel. In lighter moments he bragged about his

Las Vegas past, once dropping a name and

boasting of "taking over a town"' and being

"the boss's right arm;" how he "always

packed a gun then because business was

rough"'... the name was Howard Hughes.

At times I thought he was all blow, for as we

drove along the vast western prairies he re-

counted fantastic tales like a man hallucinating.

But I would discover later that he indeed had

connections in Las Vegas, and that the authori-

ties had once kept a close eye on his actions

here. By having a "trace" placed on his FBI

number through a friend in the Las Vegas

police department, I found that on October 7,

1959, Jack had registered as an ex-felon in

Phoenix, Arizona; and ten months later, on

July 18, 1960, he registered as an ex-felon in

Las Vegas, both places requiring known mal-

contents to so register. But also, registering as

an ex-felon implies that Jack stayed in the

Phoenix and Las Vegas arcas for a fairly long

period of time. He wasn't just passing through.

I was to discover that he stayed in Las Vegas

long enough to find himself a woman compan-

ion who remained with him — as a partner and

overseer of his various shady activities - for

the next 14 years.

...

THE COMPANION

orraine Thompson was a pretty red-hairec

woman, pleasant, unassuming, and quier.

One source who knew her thought she bad

"spent a lot of time in the backwoods of

Tennessee collecting antiques." But somehow

she migrated west. On September 23, 1955,

when she was twenty-tight years old, she

married Paul C. Gulas, thirty-three, in Las

Vegas. Oid timers in town may have heard of

Gulas, a man who naturally would have

associated with many types of people. Gulas

had been previously married and had a son,

Paul, Jr. now residing in Las Vegas.

Gulas Sr. was a Las Vegas policeman. He

went on to become the Captain of Detectives in

1968, retired from the force in 1974, and died

in Texas in early 1976, Lorraine and Gulas

were divorced after six years, on July 26,

74 OCTOBER 1983/LAS VEGAN MAGAZINE

1961. Shortly thereafter she was constantly

seen in the company of Jack Coffelt. She

called herself Tave - Tave Coffelt - although

they never married. The couple seemed pros-

perous in those years. Jack wore expensive

suits and drove a late-model Cadillac. Paul

Gulas Jr. told me that he thought "Tave" had

been a police dispatcher in Miami, Florida.

One reliable source told me "my information

is that she's FBI." Whatever her line, she was

to introduce Jack Coffelt to a new and different

world - a world of political intrigue under-

taken in the highest circles. A few months

after her divorce from Gulas in Las Vegas,

Jack and Tave set up permanent residence in

Washington D.C., and Jack entered upon his

new career as a government informant. He

was to be seen at White House inauguration

balis. He hobnobbed with Mrs. Kennedy and

Lady Bird Johnson. At least wice he entered

Nixon's presidential enclave with White

House passes. He was often seen in the

company of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover:

Indeed, as I myself witnessed in 1974, he

carried an FBI identification badge, and one

card identified him as an agent for the Bureau

of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. From the

years 1961 to 1974 Jack Coffelt seemed to

true merit of his crime had

never been fully appreciated.

play many roles. Sources who knew him in

Washington D.C. link him to undercover poli-

tical operations in such disparate places as

Egypt, Cuba, and Mexico City. One Las

Vegas FBI agent told me cryptically, "He may

well bave been CIA."

THE INSPIRATION

yant "Jack" Coffelt was born Februar

320. 1916. and grew up in near poverty i

the lead and zine mining area around Joplin,

Missouri. As a youth he hung around the

gambling halls and brothels of Picher, Okla-

homa, a few miles southwest of Joplin. Accord-

ing to those who knew him there, he was a

"strange"" youth, always into trouble.

"He never would mind. He wouldn't mind

nobody," said his sister. From the age of

fourteen on he would always be in trouble with

the law, serving a total of over twenty years in

reformatories, jails, and prisons. In the late

1940's, while serving a ten-year sentence for

auto theft and attempted escape at Atlanta

Federal Penitentiary, he was working in the

print shop as a press operator one day when he

met my father, who was editor of the prison

magazine.

In 1944, James Brown, the son of a Georgia

lawyer, had been commissioned as a second-

lieutenant in the U.S. Army-Air Force, a pilot

in a transport squadron. He was expecting to

be sent to England for the invasion of Europe,

but instead found himself facing a count martial,

charged with rape. He was sentenced to life

imprisonment and sent to Atlanta Penitentiary.

Brown, who always maintained his innocence,

was paroled in 1952 after serving eight years,

but during those years he became close friends

with Jack Coffelt. The two would often spend

hours together on the prison recreation yard.

Like many of the inmates, Coffelt often dreamt

of the perfect crime, the big job, and was fas-

cinated by Brown's ability to fly an airplane.

"He would ask me if it would be possible to

escape by landing a plane in the prison yard,"

said Brown, "or if I could fly him to Mexico if

he pulled a bank job."

After Brown's release in 1952, the two did

not hear from each other for many years.

Coffelt was discharged in 1955, after being

transferred to Leavenworth Penitentiary. in

Kansas. But their friendship during those lonely

prison years was cemented. Coffelt told me

that his admiration for my father's flying ability

was in fact the seed which culminated in his

planning the skyjacking. And he said when he

dropped the money the first man he thought of

to help him was James Brown.

The story of the skyjacking grew. According

to Coffelt, it was an exceedingly well-planned

and thoroughly rehearsed operation, He

claimed he had taken Flight 3DS from Portland

to Seattle "Iwo or three times" before the

actual crime in order to perfect the timing of

the operation. He had been trained by an

engineer who was familiar with the Boeing

727 aircraft, the only plane in commercial

operation which had a stairway which opened

directly out the rear. He was instructed to

order the pilot to fly at 15 degrees wingflaps so

that the plane could go no faster than approx-

imately 175 knots (200 mph), If it flew any

faster than that, Coffelt said, he would have

been killed by the tremendous suction effect at

the rear opening. Moreover, he ordered the

pilot to fly at 10,000 feet altitude. "That

bastard flew to 10,500 festonce," he said. "I

knew. I was wearing a wrist altimeter. I got on

the interphone and ordered him back down."

Coffelt often scoffed at the "lousy" journal-

isis who had first reported the crime. **All

they did was talk to the FBI," he said. He

Jack and Tave seemed prosperous in those years.

Jack wore

expensive suits and drove a late model Cadillac,

seemed hurt that the true merit — the intricate

planning and deception - of his crime had

never been fully appreciated. The whole idea

that D.B. Cooper had just "jumped out in the

night like Santa Claus"' was perversely ridicu-

lous to him. He claimed he had a perfect

landing site — a wheat field that was plowed

over in the fall of the year - in which to jump.

There was a large beacon near the field -

"you could see the damn thing for a hundred

miles" — a bright light which he ordered the

pilot to fly over. As part of his getaway plan

Coffelt had stashed an old army jeep a mile or

two from the field with a transmitter in it, so

that he heard a steady bleeping sound through

a receiver that he carried in the plane. The

bleeping sound grew louder and louder as he

approached the jump site.

"When it was taio

or three pitches from full intensity - that's

when I needed to jump," he said, a design

which would allow him room to float in the

parachute to a pin-point landing. "It was the

perfect crime," he lamented wistfully many

times, "the perfect crime."

But of course there is no such thing as a

perfect crime. Many factors which he could*

not have foreseen led to Jack Coffelt's defeat.

He had planned to hook the backpack contain-

ing the $200,000 to one of the military back-

packs and belt it securely around his waist, but

since stewardess Schaffner never relayed his

request for the backpack and the money was

delivered to him in a mail sack with no hooks

or belts, he was forced to open one of the para-

chutes and cut the shroud lines, which he used

to tie a loop for his arm to go through at the top

of the mail sack. This left him two out of the

three remaining chutes to choose from — and

the chest pack he opted for was the one that

was inoperative! As he descended the stairs,

burdened by the two heavy parachutes and the

25-pound sack of money on his arm, he lost his

hold on the handrail and - about a minute

before he had planned - he was sucked out by

the windstream, in his own words, "like a

cork out of a bottle."

He knew even as he was falling that he must

be nearly a mile too far north of his landing

field. Afraid of hitting the jagged mountains

which everywhere encompassed the landing

area — he had planned to free-fall for almost

thirty seconds - he tugged early on the rip-

cord of the chest pack, but to his horror it did

not open! Struggling to hold the money on his

arm, he frantically reached over his shoulder

and pulled the rip-cord of the military back-

pack. He felt the pack release and then sensed

a gentle tugging above him — it was only the

guide chute opening — which he mistook for

the main chute. Relieved that the back-up

parachute had opened at all, he relaxed his

grip on the money bag. Suddenly he was hit by

a tremendous jolt as the 28-foot main canopy

opened, and the bag of money slid off his

dangling arm and tumbled away into the

darkness.

Almost instantaneously, the billowing para-

chute was tossed by ferocious winds from the

thunderstorms which had moved in over the

mountains earlier that night. He was helplessly

tossed and thrown about. Sleet and hail pelted

his face and soaked his clothes. He was unable

to see any of the ground lights which he and an

accomplice had set up to assist him in guiding

the parachute to the landing field. Below him,

somewhere in the immense darkness, waited

jagged cliffs and vast forests of towering

Ponderosa pines. He saw the lights of the

Boeing 727 slowly disappear and, tailing about

half a mile bchind it, the lights of a C-)30

cargo plane carrying would-be pursuers — a

paratrooper squadron from McChord Air

Force Base in Tacoma, Washington, But they

had not seen him jump. Due to the raging

storn the cargo plane's scanning radar was

rendered useless.

Coffelt crashed down on a mountain slope,

hitting a tree limb between his legs and

crushing his ankles as he plowed into the rocky

surface. But even though he was in severe

pain, he gathered the billowing chute around

his legs, clawed a hole in the loose scree and

compacted the chute into it, then sprayed it

with a magnesium compound - he explained

the magnesium would turn so hot it would

melt even the metal harness buckles - and set

a match to it so there would be no evidence for

any would-be pursuers to ever find.

Coffelt explained to us, with a look of horror

and pain on his face, how he had spent over 15

hours clawing his way — at times on hands and

knees — through the dense underbrush of the

forest and up the side of a towering rock cliff,

finally coming out the next morning into a

meadow where he saw a trail that was familiar

to him. He walked along the narrow logging

trail until he found the hidden jeep, then, using

the vehicle's two-way radio, contacted his

accomplice who had been cruising a highway

twenty miles away hoping to see signs of the

fallen parachute. He rendezvoused with this

accomplice - whom he described vaguely as

"an Army man" — at an isolated point along

the deep and swift-moving Deschutes River

which meanders through central Oregon, and

there pushed the jeep over a cliff into the

rushing waters, blowing it to pieces with a

charge of dynamite as it went down. Then he

climbed in the back seat of the getaway car and

was driven two thousand miles across back

Toads to a place somewhere in the Midwest,

where a friendly doctor quietly treated his

injuries.

76 OCTOBER 1983/LAS VEGAN MAGAZINE

My father, by nature a

deeply suspicious man, grew

increasingly worried. "What

are we getting ourselves

into?" he asked me over and

over again.

THE

CONSPIRACY

Coffelt had returned to the Oregon area twice

- in the spring and fall of 1972 - to search

for the missing money, each time without

success,

until in desperation he decided to

solicit my father's help. He further maintained

that the FBI had tried to kill him in connection

with the crime. "They wanted to silence me,"

he said. "I had to leave Washingion D.C.

fast." So he had moved with Tave to the Seattle

area — like a true conman secretly returning to

the scene of the crime — and rented an apart-

ment in the middle-class suburb of Lynnwood.

There, in that cold and rainy environment, his

health deteriorated. He began taking nitro-

glycerin tablets — a habit which he continued

during our journey — to prevent clotting of his

blood.

He was a terribly desperate man.

''That job was my last chance,' he mused. "It

meant everything to me. I had nothing to lose."

Nothing except his life.

Try as he might to downplay them, hints of a

broad, complex conspiracy began to weave

their way into Coffelt's story, and we grew

more and more worried the closer we came to

our destination of Oregon. Accerding to him,

there were at least three co-conspirators still

lurking about who had vested interests in the

money being found. One of these men, whom

Coffelt called the "ring-leader," was actually

a former pilot who was "grounded because

of heart trouble," and who was thus terribly

embittered at life.

This man, relying on

his years of experience in flying over the area,

had actually picked the Oregon locale as the

best place in the country to pull off the sky-

jacking. Also, there was the mysterious

engineer whom Coffelt claimed had instructed

him about the workings of the Boeing 727 air-

craft, and then there was the "Army man" -

the accomplice waiting on the ground for him.

To satisfy all these mysterious people, the

real take was supposed to be several million

dollars of used bank notes that were to be

loaded onto the plane at Portland by an armored

Brinks truck.

"But the goddam Brinks truck

never showed," said Coffelt. "I kept watching

out the terminal windows for it. I almost got

left behind." It was then that he decided to put

into effect "Plan B" - the demand for a

$200,000 ransom. "If someone was trying to

double-cross me,"' he explained, "I'd get my

share anyway," But some, or all, of these

people never believed that he lost the money

and with growing impatience had beleaguered

him for their cut. He had been threatened, and

had counter-threatened to blow the whole story

if they didn't take the heat off. "I feel like a

hunted animal," he said to me many times.

"You and your father are the only people I can

trust anymore.

But the two old prison buddies could not

recapture the past. There was a gulf between

them that could not be filled. My father, who

had left his prison years behind him like a bad

dream, had gone on to become an engineer,

and his critical mind was thirsting for hard

details about the skyjacking. He constantly

quizzed Coffelt. "Who helped you plan this

thing, Jack? What's this man's name — this

engineer? What about this former pilot? You

trying to tell me he was the brains behind it?"

But Jack wasn't saying a damn word more

about it. "You just help me find my money,

James, and you'll get your cut. But don't ask

1o0 many goddam questions."

A deep rift developed between the two men.

My father, by nature a deeply suspicious man,

grew increasingly worried.

""What are we

getting ourselves into?"' he asked me over and

over again. In a few short days the skyjacking

had grown from the job of one lonely man to a

conspiracy with vast tentacles. Were we al-

ready, perhaps, accessories-after-the-fact to a

federal crime? But Coffelt took me aside and

pleaded: "You've got to keep your father with

me. This is my last chance." His bigges: worry

was that the authorities would finally catch up

with him and that he would either be killed or

die in a cold prison cell.

Our journey became a battle of wits and

emotions in which I was pulled between the

two men — laking sides now for one, then for

the other — until the loneliness of our quest

and the haunting isolation of the vasi western

expanses began to get us down. My father

threatened to abandon the trip and return home.

But the desperate Coffelt, with a sinister

portent in his voice, counter-threatened: **You

know too much already, James."

The end came on July 12, 1974, when we

returned to camp after a long day of searching

for the bag of money. We had been in the

search area for about a week. Coffelt had taken

us to the place where he had hit the slope and

showed us the broken tree limb he had crashed

into. We could still see the long skid marks

where his heels had plowed into the loose

rocks. Climbing back up the stope he nearly

died, coughing up blood and choking horribly

as he gasped for air. He and my father had a

terrible fight over where we should concentrate

the search. My father wanted to start from

where Coffeit had landed and backtrack from

there. But Coffelt was afraid we would be

spotted by forest rangers — a lookout tower

was visible in the distance — and he wanted to

begin the search farther to the west, in the

dense forests at the base of 11,000 ft. Mount

Hood. "I know my money's there," he cried

angrily. "You"re looking

in the wrong

place." But those forests were so thick with

blow-down and debris and tangled underbrush

that it was impossible to see one another from

ten feet away. Even in broad daylight the forest

floor was blanketed with darkness. The chances

of spotting a faded bag of money there seemed

hopeless.

Coffelt returned to Seattle, claiming he

needed to recuperate for a few days. Then, the

very next day an astonishing thing happened.

While we prepared for dinner a car suddenly

appeared on the rutted trail in frent of us and

sped past. Beside the driver sat a passenger

cradling a rifle between his legs. The car's

license plates read KANSAS - Coffelt

country! Shortly down the trail the car stopped

abruptly and doors slammed. Then, as darkness

enveloped us, we suddenly made out a black

pickup truck through the trees behind us. Two

men with guns climbed out of it. Everywhere

around us we heard whispering voices and

footsteps treading the underbrush, coming in

our direction. In a panic we jumped in our

tnick and, guided only my moonlight, sped

over the trails while behind us we saw the

lights of the two strange vehicles furiously

careening through the forest after us. We

made it to a paved road and sped south. In two

days we were in Las Vegas - my father

wanted to take a southerly route to throw the

pursuers off our scent - and in four days we

were back in Georgia. We sincerely believed

that Coffeit had sent the men - perhaps his

accomplices - to kill us. Whatever the case,

we would never see him again. We had failed

in our mission to find a pot of gold at the end

of the rainbow.

THE DISCOVERY

OF

D.B. COOPER

THE TT EVIDENCE

PART

by Byron H. Brown

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION:

This month marks the 12th anniversary of a crime which

Time magazine said, "rivaled Alfred Hitchcock's more

baroque fantasies" - the hijacking of a Northwest Airlines

Boeing 727 enroute from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Wash-

ington by a bomb-wielding man known as D.B. Cooper. After

he extorted $200,000 from the airline and was delivered four

parachutes, as the jet headed south from Seattle to Reno, the

skyjacker boldly made good a parachute escape and was never

seen again.

In our October issue Las Vegas investigative reporter Byron

Brown revealed for the first time the true identity of the

famous skyjacker. He was Bryant "Jack" Coffelt, a former

Leavenworth Penitentiary inmate and life-long con-man, and

also a friend of Byron's father, James Brown. In the summer

of 1974 Coffeit asked the two to meet him in Joplin, Missouri.

From there, they traveled to Oregon with him for the purpose

of searching for the $200,000 ransom he had dropped when

one of the parachutes he was wearing during the jump mal-

functioned. The dummy chute was only one of many attempts

by the authorities to foil the crime.

The three were unsuccessful in their attempt to find the

money, but Byron Brown was able to learn many obscure,

never-exposed details abou the skyjacking from Coffelt.

During the next several years he conducted an extensive

investigation of his claims, one which resulted in Coffelt's

being identified as D.B. Cooper by two eye-witnesses on the

hijacked plane. The investigation was a lonely personal odyssey

for Brown, who encountered official resistance at every step

of the way, perhaps because Coffelt, it turned out, was for

many years a Washington D.C. government informant.

Highlights from Brown's investigation, which promises to

have far-reaching ramifications, are published for the first

time in the following pages of Las Vegan. This month, as the

town of Ariel, Washington celebrates its annual "D.B. Cooper

Festival" in henor of the skyjacker, the participants should

be pleased to know that he has finally been discovered. J.E.S.

The Prophet

America, and especially Las Vegas, is rife

with legends of desperate characters who have

suddenly struck it rich by forcing the odds,

• through skill or bluff, to turn in their favor -

but few have been as enduringly popular as

the lone bandit who heroically jumped from a

lumbering jetliner into universal fame and also

complete oblivion in the same moment.

He was erroneously called "D.B. Cooper"

out of the sky was not an exploit taken lightly

by the authorities.

Clearly the crime could have resulted in

tragedy, but since the daring skyjacker had not

hurt anyone the public preferred to forget its

more horrible aspects and instead remembered

Cooper fondly as the man who had beat the

system while thumbing his nose at authority.

The skyjacking took on the aura of myth,

Cooper's down-home, simple nom de guerre

was honored everywhere, and it was hoped by

many that he was happily enjoying his $200,000

in some secret paradisiacal haven.

by a thrilled news media, which saw in his act

the fulfillment of every man's secret hopes -

even though he spelt his first name as "Dan"

on his flight ticket. "D.B. Cooper,Where Are

You?" became a kind of call-to-arms for the

rebellious young generation during the early

1970's, when "dropping out" was the current

fad. Cooper bravely symbolized the new

mentality and daringly captured the public

fancy with his crime. In an era when traditional

craft which only a pilot or engineer could

possibly know — such as the 15-degree wing-

flaps configuration he ordered which restricted

the plane's speed to barely 200 miles per hour,

and how to put into effect the complicated

maneuver of lowering the 727's rear stairway

compartment. Also, another aspect which

revealed the skyjacker's shrewd planning

became clear only after the episode was over.

On that Thanksgiving Eve — the day before a

major holiday and one on which Northwest

Airlines expected capacity loads of vacation

travellers - Flight 305, upon departing Port-

land, was barely one-third full. D.B. Cooper

had called in a barrage of phony reservations

— fictitious people who never showed — which

left virtually the entire back half of the plane

all to himself. No one could overpower him

and wrest the bomb away. He was in complete

control. At the time, some authorities called

him a "cool master criminal" and speculated

that he must have been an experienced para-

chutist, possibly even a Green Beret.

heroes were fast dying, Americans had finally

found one in a new breed of bandit.

Cooper's was the first and only successful

skyjacking for ransom in American history,

and largely because of the crime - which

occurred on Thanksgiving Eve, November 24,

1971 - and a rash of other skyjackings which

followed in its wake, a new era of elecironic

passenger screening was inaugurated at the

nation's airports within a year. Commandeering

a plane and threatening to blow innocent people

The most erroneous part of the myth which

prevailed, it is now apparent, was that Cooper

was probably a small-time businessman, or

even a timid corporate ladder-climber in the

mold of Walter Milly, who grew disgruntled at

the pressures of modern life and decided one

day to give it all up, perform a dramatic fool-

proof heist, and sail off to Tahiti to spend the

rest of his days in peace. Of course he had no

real plan: the crime was a lark, a spur-of-the-

moment decision to enact a smoldering dream

—and if he failed? Then so what? It was worth

the risk.

But to many familiar with the case this

popular myth seemed entirely unfeasible.

There were too many indications that Cooper

had planned the job with cool foresight and

calculated reason. He knew to the minutest

detail technical aspects of the Boeing 727 air-

The leads were so threadbare - a few

cigarette butts were the only personal effects

the skyjacker left behind - that the authorities

were completely palled. There was not even a

soltd clue as to where Cooper bailed out of the

plane. The crew recalled feeling a strong

"pressure bump" over the Woodland, Wash-

ington area twenty miles north of Portland -

but even so they never bothered to peer out the

cockpit door to see if the skyjacker was gone.

Instead, they flew on for three more hours

until landing in Reno for a refueling stop,

where it was discovered that Cooper and his

$200,000 ransom had already disappeared into

the night.

But it would have been highly impractical

for the skyjacker to jump into the Woodland,

Washington vicinity, which is dotted by small

communities and farms. In view of the intricate

planning which had otherwise gone into the

crime, it makes little sense that Cooper would

bail out there - taking the absurd chance,

obviously, of landing in a farmer's apple

orchard or a supermarket parking lot. By all

appearances, Cooper wanted to survive the

jump and escape to spend the money. He may

have been at the end of an old rope, but he was

also at the beginning of a new and, he hoped,

better one.

In the twelve years since the crime occurred

not one shred of physical evidence about

Cooper himself has ever been uncovered any-

where near Woodland, Washington - not one

reported sighting of the ruddy-faced villain nor

the rotting remains of a dead body strapped to

a parachute discovered lying in the forest

there. It is only logical to assume, therefore,

that Cooper had without doubt reconnaissanced

a place where he could touch down safely in

the parachute - a place far from scrutiny by

either the authorities or amateur sleuths, and

one remote enough to hide all traces of the

crime or its brazen perpetralor.

Far back in the rugged hinterlands of the

Pacific Northwest there exists a site which can

only be described as ideal for Cooper to have

- Landed undetected in his parachute. The plains

country of central Oregon boasts some of the

most beautiful yet hauntingly isolated scenery

in America. To the west of the rolling plains

the treacherous Cascade Mountains tower

thousands of feet into the sky. Nearby, adjoin-

landscape in a checker-board fashion at

random places where a juncture in the hills

abandoned every year after the autumn harvest,

bales of hay still litter the floor where someone

Coffelt's Leavenworth

Penitentiary mugshots were

almost impossible to obtain.

When the records clerk at that

Kansas prison was contacted,

he said that there was no

record ever of Bryant "Jack"

Coffelt having been admitted

to Leavenworth Penitentiary.

My father remembered two

aliases that Coffelt had used

when he knew him in Atlanta

Penitentiary: "John Hardy,

Jr." and "J. C. Ross." When

the records clerk at Leaven-

worth was asked to check his

who did not know his aliases would encounter a stone wall.

A source close to the Carter Administration, one having intimate knowledge of the policies

of the United States Attorney General's office, told me: "A federal prisoner is sentenced to

the 'custody of the Attorney General of the United States.' We can put him up in a motel

room for his entire sentence if we want to." This Carter Administration "insider" finally

managed to retrieve for us Coffelt's files from both Atlanta Penitentiary and Leavenworth.

Scattle attorney George LeBissoniere, who also identified my 1974 snapshots, claims that

he identified Coffell's Leavenworth photos as D.B. Cooper for the FBi six weeks after the

skyjacking. "The FBI never calied back,"' LeBissoniere told me. Florense Schaffner also

identified both the Leavenworth photos and my 1974 snapshots of Coffelt as Cooper, and

has always believed that the FBI composite drawings of Cooper were "wrong." (See pp. 81-

82) The former stewardess, who sat beside Cooper for over two hours, said that the FBI

artist who drew the composites failed to follow her instructions concerning Cooper's true

features. Even before she saw my photographs of Coffelt, she*destribed Cooper to me as

having a "longer, fuller face" than the FBI composites showed, with a hairline "not nearly

as receding." (LeBissoniere and Schaffner both have preserved their testimony on videotape.)

My 1974 snapshots are the only photographs (other than his prison mugshots) known to

exist of Jack Coffelt. He was, after all, a man who did not want his picture taken.

found these bales of hay, and

some others

along the edge of the field, piled up and

smoldering. I thought smugglers were running

drugs in here and using the fires as ground-

pattern lights for a small airplane."

But the forest trails surrounding the huge

field provided impenetrable refuge for who-

ever was there, and the deputy sheriff captured

no one. After the skyjacking, he recalled, the

mysterious fires ceased. According to Jack

Coffelt, who led me to the field in 1974, the

bales of hay had been set afire to help guide

him to a safe landing in the parachute in the

dark. He and his accomplice, he explained,

had practiced their escape maneuvers during

the nights immediately preceding the sky-

jacking.

But the scene on those vast tundra ranges

grows even more compelling. A few miles

south of the field, near an Indian reservation,

lies a small man-made lake called Pine Hollow

Reservoir. On one shore of the tiny lake stand

a few small, dilapidated, privately-owned

cabins which have been rented out to wayworn

travellers for as long as people can remember.

The place is secluded and peaceful, and amidst

the little group of weather-beaten buildings,

with the austere peak of Mount Hood reflected

in the crystalline lake nearby, one feels utterly

anonymous. But there is an extraordinary and

baffling curiousity here: on the porch of one of

the ancient structures stands a Navy battleship

beacon capable of emitting a beam of light

which can be seen well over a hundred miles!

The day I discovered it the beacon's glass

face - nearly three feet in diameter - was

resting on a steel swivel plate that was frozen

solid with rust. Strangely, it was aimed on the

compass reading which directed it towards

Coffelt's landing field in the hills a few miles

to the north! None of the locals recalls how the

huge beacon came to arrive there, but Jack

Coffelt told me in 1974 that he ordered the

pilot of Flight 305 to "home in on a huge

beacon" located south of the landing field —

even though he never took me to where the

beacon was eventually found.

The real reason I went to Pine Hollow

Reservoir was because Jack informed me

cagily, "The getaway car — my Cadillac -

was parked beside a lake near an Indian

reservation,"' as he pointed to the plains south

of the landing site to indicate the general area.

But he distinctly appeared to want to avoid that

area, as if he thought someone there might

recognize him. When I finally found the beacon

there I was immensely impressed by the clear

- indeed beautiful - design which its secret

location revealed. As I gazed at the small

enclave of cabins huddled together in that

remote hideaway on the plains, it seemed the

perfect place for his accomplice to have waited,

with walkie-talkie in hand, for Jack to radio

- him that he had finally touched down in the

failed to pick up the falling skyjacker.

Nevertheless, in anticipation of possible

ground pursuit, Coffelt had stashed a World

War Two Army jeep in the woods. The jeep

was equipped with food and water, and was

stationed high in the foothills a few miles west

of the landing field. In case he was pursued on

the ground he would bury the money, make his

way to the jeep and from there maneuver the

vehicle far down obscure forest trails to a

cave-like hideout, lying low until the heat was

off. The accomplice operating the Cadillac

would stand by, passing the days quietly as just

another tourist at the lonesome but tranquil

cabins at Pine Hollow Reservoir • until the

time was ripe for their escape. Then the two

would rendezvous, retrieve the buried money,

discard the jeep into a nearby river and set out

in the Cadillac for their Midwestern haven. "It

was the perfect crime," Coffelt told me. "We

planned for every possibility."

Accordingly, the Army jeep served a dual

purpose. In addition to serving as a back-up

getaway vehicle, the jeep was stationed strate-

gically to aid in the jump itself - it carried an

electronic beeper which emitted a signal on a

special radio frequency. As the skyjacked

plane headed south from Seattle, Coffelt,

listening through a receiver strapped to his

wrist for the signal coming from the jeep,

planned to jump when it was two or three

pitches from its loudest intensity - a point at

which he would be roughly a mile due north of

the jeep itself, and from there he could easily

float down-wind in the parachute to a pin-point

landing on the field at the edge of the plains.

No trace of the jeep has ever been found.

The Deschutes River, where according to

Coffelt it was plunged into the waters and de-

stroyed with dynamite, is extremely treacher-

ous to divers due to its raging currents and

rocky bottom, so the possibility of finding its

remains there is remote. But a fascinating

shred of evidence that such a jeep existed and

was used in the skyjacking has been uncovered

like a rare archaeological find.

A retired U.S. Forest Service agent ac-

companied me to the place where Coffelt

showed me he had stashed the World War

Two Army jeep in the dense forests at the base

of Mount Hood. Faded tire tracks were still

visible where a vehicle had been backed into a

stand of small maple trees years ago. A pile of

rotted brushwood lay off to one side - the

maple branches which Coffelt claimed he had

used to camouflage the jeep. The expert

forester immediately noticed a young tree

growing through one of the tire tracks which

revealed a past injury _ an elbow hook dis-

figuration at its base which indicated the tree

had been severely crushed by a heavy object

years carlier. He sawed through the disfigured

area and later analyzed the small segment at

the agency laboratory. Amazingly, the annual

growth rings - which record every event in a

tree's life in a kind of fossilized record - re-

vealed that the sapling had been damaged in

the autumn of 1971-the rime of the skyjacking!

Even though such intricate planning was in-

volved in the heist - Coffelt claimed he had

spent eleven months and $10,000 of his own

money just setting it up — the crime ended in

abysmal failure and nearly death for Coffelt

himself! He could not possibly have foreseen,

however, the raging intensity of the thunder-

storms which descended upon the Cascades

that night when he boarded the plane in Port-

land, In the Pacific Northwest, thunderhead

clouds often rush inland from the ocean and

envelope the mountains in a matter of minutes

with violent force. Because of the storms, he

Unknown to him, the authorities at Seattle

back to open, but when the reserve chute's

large 28-foos canopy billowed into the cross-

current winds (in fact, according to experienced

parachutists it was a miracle that it opened at

all) he was hit by such a severe jolt that the bag

of money slipped our of his arms and lumbled

away into the darkness. To cap his awesome

misfortune — the signal fires on the landing

field below were nowhere to be seen! He had

dived from the plane far too early. The landing

field was still miles ahead! Far in the distance,

through the dark sea of clouds, he could see

the bright swath cut by the huge beacon light at

Pine Hollow Reservoir - where his accomplice

waited in vain, But soon, as he descended into

: a canyon, even that light disappeared.

Completely enveloped in a nightmare of

darkness, he only realized he was at last hitting

the ground when he crashed through the splin-

tering, phantom-like branches of a hillside tree.

He hit the slope blindly at nearly thirty miles

per hour and was dashed into the rocks! But he

had made it. He was down. And as he told me

later: "I came back to life at that first shocked

breath. I wanted desperately to live!"

Almost semi-conscious, he had terrifying

visions of paratroopers from the C-130 cargo

pursuit plane alighting like ghosts on the slope

around him. Before he had tumbled from the

727 he had seen the chase plane's search lights

scanning the cloud mass behind him. Frantical-

ly, he gathered the surging folds of the para-

chute's wind-tossed canopy around his bleeding

legs — the bright material was flapping wildly

like a huge crippled moth straining to free it-

self - and compacted the reckless mass into a

shallow depression he had clawed in the dirt.

Then he placed the sport-type chest chute on

top of this mass and sprayed the pile with a

magnesium compound from an aerosol can

and set it afire with a cigarette lighter. The

nylon fabric was instantly consumed by the

flames, melting like a mirage into the ground

before his dazed eyes. Groping his way, he

stumbled down the pitch-black slope in severe

pain because, upon landing, he had squarely

hit a tree limb between his legs and punctured

his chest on one of the tree's sharp branches.

It took him fifteen hours to make his way out

of the vast canyon lined with sheer rock-faced

cliffs that he had fallen into. He spent the

longest and most arduous night of his life

desperately clawing his way through tangled

underbrush and climbing over jutting boulders

to finally see brilliant sunshine on a clear

Thanksgiving Day morning, and feel "lo the

depths of my spirit"' as he told me later, "a

new appreciation for everything around me

that was alive." The cerie neon glow of startled

eyes revealing lurking cougars and timber

wolves, and the ferocious menacing cries of

the wild animals terrified him that night like

demons, he told me. The experience in that

awesome necropolis of nature would haunt

him always.

Today, the canyon remains as remote and

undisturbed as it has been for centuries. Twenty

We searched the slope for half a day, but

found nothing. The late afternoon sun, rapidly

falling behind the surrounding cliffs, was

casting an eerie orange glow through the trees

as it suddenly turned bitterly cold. Finally, just

before leaving, I tilled one last shovel-full of

dirt when I suddenly realized that I was standing

over the very spot where three years earlier, in

1974, Jack Coffelt showed me he had destroyed

his parachute. Something in the fading sky felt

hauntingly unreal to me as I noticed lying in

the freshly-exposed dirt a white piece of cord

about the length of a cigarette! I reached down

to pick up the cord, but when I touched the

edges three-quarters of it blew away instantly!

The fine white ashes melted into the darkening

sky like filaments of a seeding dandelion.

Everything was silent but the wind. As if in a

dream, 1 realized that I was holding a tiny

piece of the cord in my fingertips.

My companions and I began furiously digging

in stark amazement. We immediately found

a larger patch of the same type fabric (which

looked somewhat like snake skin, and must

have been a fold of the parachute) lying just

beneath the sopsoil, but it too turned to ashes

and melted in the churning wind! The canyon

echoed the surging gusts like an ampitheater,

drowning out the faint whisper of the past that

had been so fleetingly revealed to me by the

mountains. Jack Coffelt, a man who always

strived to cover his tracks, had apparently

stepped in one of them on that night long ago,

crushing a parachute shroud line into the dirt

beneath his boot where it escaped total de-

moment in 1971 when Jack briefly illuminated

the night sky with his fire.

After our return to Las Vegas, my father

local forensic lab used by the police and FBI -

Allas Chemical Testing Laboratories on High-

land Drive in Las Vegas. There, under 300-

cord about the length

reached down to pick

up the cord, but when

I touched the edges

blew away instantly!

In 1974, as my father and I travelled with

Jack through remote areas of the West (we

took backroads, staying away from major cities

because Jack said "law people" were on the

lookout for him) we were forced to pry infor-

mation from him against his will. He had only

one design for us, to lead us to the place where

he lost the money so that we could search for

it, if need be for the entire summer. But as we

pressured him for more information about the

crime, details which were starkly different

from published accounts of the skyjacking, we

began to fear that we were merely pawns in a

dangerous game conducted by sinister ele-

ments. Parts of his story were so far-fetched -

he threw out many red-hertings to steer us

away from the truth, and claimed that a vast

cover-up of the crime was being conducted by

the government - that we grew increasingly

paranoid as

we travelled through rugged

mountains and across lonesome canyonlands

with the raggedly-desperate man. But as the

trip wore on we learned many new and startling

details about the crime that would later be

verified by witnesses.

One of the most obscure features of his nar-

rative concerned Coffelt's insistence that our

search was for a green bag filled with money—

not the white canvas mail bag which, according

to news accounts, the authorities had delivered

to him at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. When

pressed to explain this discrepancy, Jack said

that he took the green bag out of the briefcase

which contained his bomb, and hoping that this

"rubberized" bag, as he called it,

would prevent the money from getting wet and

rotting in case he were pursued on the ground

and had to bury it, slipped the canvas mail sack

full of money into it. Then he selected one of

the four parachutes which appeared the least

trustworthy and tore it open, cutting the shroud

lines off of it with a long, thin-bladed knife.

He then wrapped the shroud lines tightly around

the top of the green protective bag, leaving a

loop in the cords for his arm to go through. He

would hold the money in the crook of his elbow

as he leaped from the plane.

At this point the jetliner had left Seattle and

was heading south toward Reno. At Seattle he

had allowed all of the passengers and two of

the stewardesses to leave the plane, keeping a

sole hostage - stewardess Tina Mucklow -

with him in the back. As soon as the plane rook

flight he reached in the bag of money, he

boastingly recounted, and grabbing a handful

of the loot offered it to Tina Mucklow. *Take

it, Honey," he cajoled, "they don't pay you

enough!" — playing his tough-guy Bogart

role, romantic and wry at the same time with

just a trace of embarrassed compassion. But

"the pretty little blonde, "as Jack described

her, refused the loot, telling him she almost

certainly would be given a lie detector test.

Nevertheless, Jack placed the money on a

nearby seat, thinking she might change her

mind and later take it. She didn't, and shortly

atterwards, just a few minutes before jumping,

he threw the small: bundle of money out the

back of the plane along with his briefcase and

other items that he no longer needed. By then

he had already tied up the bag of money, and

since he was wearing thick thermal underwear

there was nowhere to stuff the small bundle of

Indeed.

Ever since the skyjacking occurred in late 1971, the FBI concentrated its search for Cooper

around the town of Woodland, Washington - an area between 10 and 25 miles north of

Where young Ingram found the badly decomposed bills. The crew of the skyjacked plane

had informed the FBI that a series of strong "pressure bumps"' occurted directly over

Woodland, suggesting that Cooper bailed out there. Also, a red warning light had gone on in

the cabin, indicating that the 727's rear stairway had been lowered. But after Brian Ingram's

find, according to UPI press dispaiches, "the location of the money ... caused the FBI to

reconsider its calculations."

Cooper, it became clear, could not possibly have bailed out over Woodland since part of

his money was later discovered far south of there! The perpicxed authorities were forced lo

admit that they spent years conducting a wild goose chase. As Jack Coffeh often used to say,

"If I'm lying, God's a possum."

But there was another problem. Originally, it was thought that the plane had veered west

of Portland on its southbound flight, but the location of the rotted money, which FBI Agent

Himmelsbach shrewdly noted "must have tumbled and rolled along the bottom of the

Columbia River," proved without a doubt that the plane flew east of Portland - exactly as

Jack Coffelt insisted! The wide and sedate Columbia flows from east to west; the money

could not possibly have floated against the current.

Jack Coffelt claimed that he threw a few bundles - perhaps $4,000 or $5,000 worth, he

said — of the ransom money out the back of the plane over the Bonneville Dam on the

Columbia River, after stewardess Tina Mucklow refused to accept it. Nine years later,

Brian Ingram apparently had found that money. But he was unaware of the importance of

his discovery. The find at last provided proof that the plane had flown east of Portland, and

also shot a gaping hole right through the FBI's belief that Cooper never made it to Oregon!

On that sand bar beside the river, the astonished boy did not realize that he was holding a

white-hot smoking gun...

tantly tossed it out over a "brightly-lit hydro-

electric dam" — the Bonneville Dam on the

Columbia River. Incredibly, nine years later,

in February 1980, the bundle of cash would be

discovered lying in a sand bar beside the river

- the soggy bills revealing serial numbers

which matched the ones given D.B. Cooper!

(See sidebar)

But Jack was not yet through with the

frightened young woman, who to this day still

appears mesmerized by the skyjacker. Standing

with only her in the empty corridor at the rear

of the plane, he approached her and, as Jack

put it, "felt her up a bit." She sensed his lone-

liness and fear and whispered consoling words,

trying to calm him, but he told her, sadly, "I

have nothing to lose." His swaggering account

to us: "She was the last woman I may have

seen in my life! I wanted her to have something,

you know, to remember me by."

Original press accounts of the skyjacking,

and public statements by the FBI, never re-

ported these intricate details: nothing about a

green bag, nothing about Cooper offering Tina

Mucklow part of the ransom money or his using

a knife with a long, thin blade to cut up the

shroud lines from one of the parachutes was

ever mentioned — except by Jack Coffelt. The

authorities did reveal however (as if they were

puzzled by the find) that cut-up parachute

shroud lines were discovered lying on the floor

in the back of the plane when it landed in Reno.

But at a meeting with her in San Diego in

1977, Tina Mucklow confirmed each one of

these obscure details - especially noting the

green bag, which she thought was made of

glossy paper or plastic, folded in a comer of

Cooper's briefcase. Before he slipped the mail

sack full of money into the green bag he ordered

her forward into the cockpit. He did not want

her to observe this move in case she informed

the authorities, who might then be able to de-

cipher his actions, which were designed to

confuse any ground pursuers. Jack said that in

case he were chased on the ground he would

pretend to be one of the searchers, flashing his

government ID to anyone who might question

him, a green FBI badge with his name on it, in

fact, which he showed me in 1974!

Tina watched him tear open one of the para-

chutes and cut the shroud lines off of it using a

long, thin-bladed knife which according to ler

"looked like a dagger." She recalled that he

nervously chain-smoked Raleigh gigarettes,

(Raleighs were Coffeit's favorite brand) and

aiso admitted that Cooper offered her a handful

of the loot, digging into the bag of money and

shoving the small bundle at her, insisting that

she take it. But when

she was delicately

prompted about whether the skyjacker had

touched her "in any way," she flushed heavily

and averted her eyes before answering faintly,

"He may have made a pass at me." Many

years had passed, but scars still remained from

this ugly incident involving the desperate bandit

who briefly but dramatically entered her life,

then disappeared into total mystery again.

She clearly remembered his hushed words,

though, words which seemed to haunt her still-

"I have nothing to lose" - the same phrase

that Jack Coffelt repeated to me many times

during our lonely journey together in 1974.

Even though Tina Mucklow confirmed every

one of Coffelt's details about these hectic and

obscure events which occurred as the planc

headed south from Seattle, she was not in fact

the person who had observed him most care-

fully that night. As his sole hostage at that

point, she remained with Cooper for only a

few short minutes as he frantically prepared to

jump and attempted to lower the 727's rear

stairway compartment, a period in which she

was scared half to death. Since he had de-

manded four parachutes, the terrified crew,

especially Tina herself, thought that he was

planning to force at least one of them to bail

out with him! Tina remembers these horrifying

moments like the sordid images of a long-

There was another stewardess, however,

who during the long fight from Portland 10

Seattle before she was released there by him

(the plane circled high above Sea-Tac Airport

for nearly two-and-a-half hours waiting for the

ransom and four parachutes to be collected)

was able to observe Cooper very closely,

indeed intimately. In fact, the two even carried

on a casual and sometimes enraptured conver-

sation for much of that time.

Florence Schaffner, the

stewardess who

complete enigma to me. For years, judging

from various news accounts of the skyjacking

that I had researched, she remained completely

unavailable to the newsmedia. Indeed, I had

the distinct impression that she was being kept

under some sort of "wraps" by the authorities.

Even reporters from Time magazine and the

Washington Post had been unable to contact

her. She always remained mysteriously aloof

from the wave of publicity generated in the

skyjacking's aftermath.

Immediately after the crime she dropped

completely out of sight and the public soon

forgot, or was never even aware, that for over

two hours that night she dutifully attended the

"terribly lonesome man," as she described

Cooper to me, rushing to bring him coffee and

snacks, listening politely to his sad, vague

ramblings suggestive of a checkered past and

innocently wishing: him, "Good luck ... 1

hope you make it."

you?" she remembers asking Cooper when the

So even though some ominous mystique still

hangs over Henderson within the cloud (for

even if it's totally safe, it still is there and

people are ever aware of its presence), it

apparently is no more than a distraction. Gary

Johnson, executive director of the Chamber of

Commerce, who has been a Henderson resident

for 15 years and helped develop Clark County

air quality information as a member of the

County

Citizens' Environmental Advisory

Board, indicates that all studies done to date

that list air alert areas in Southern Nevada

don't even mention Henderson,

Now discussions of this secmingly tiny

community (it actually is the largest city in

Nevada, area-wise covering 70 square miles)

revolve around the growth taking place there.

Henderson started out as a mining town

called Basic Townsite, built by the government

just prior to World War Il to support the miners

working at a plant constructed in a joint effort

between the U.S. and England to manufacture

magnesium. The town is now a thriving Las

Vegas suburb.

The area was first selected for the plant in

the carly 1940's because of its proximity to

hydro-power from Lake Mead and Hoover

Dam, Nearby was an ore-mining site, as was

the newly flourishing city of Las Vegas and the

Las Vegas Gunnery Range (now Nellis Air

Force Base). The spot was also a watering stop

for the Union Pacific Railroad,

After the war, the magnesium stock-piled

and the plant was closed. The Federal Govern-

ment was ready to dismantle the little town

around it. Local businessmen who had made a

home there decided to establish a Chamber of

Commerce and keep the community alive.

•They renamed it Henderson for Nevada's

U.S. Senator Charles B. Henderson, in

January of 1944.

Henderson's largest period of growth took

place in the 1960's and 70's, until the economy

slowed down. In fact, one local bank ran an

article in its in-house publication that contained

a study by the Federal Govemment predicting

that Henderson, if the growth pattern of the

city of 30,000 continued on its course, would

come within 12,000 of the population of Las

Vegas by the year 2,000. That prediction might

have to be updated though, as the study was

done before the economic slowdown of the late

70's.

With the economy now improving however,

Henderson is once again on its quiet growth

surge. Prior to the slowdown the largest section

of growth was the western portion of the town

with the flourishing Green Valley area supply-

ing beautiful housing and much of the shopping

facilities for local residents.

That area has also been the most prestigious,

due to established businesses like Nick's

Supper Club, the Boulder City Theater, and

Timet, which have been joined in recent years

by big name industries including Levi Straus,

Stauffer, Dick Blick Art Supplies, Ethel M,

and GTE.

The northem area is most recently beginning

to grow rapidly, with U.S. Homes doing a

great deal of building, a new shopping mall

going up with a new Senior Citizens Center

adjacent to it, and the Henderson Convalescent

Center with a 120-bed facility under con-

struction.

With the recent completion of the new

Convention Center, Henderson is also about lo

embark upon a $5 million Boulder Highway

beautification project, which will benefit

surrounding local communities as well.

The highway project includes planting

greenery along the sides and center of the

roadway from Sunset Road to Horizon Drive.

Parks and bicycle and pedestrian paths are also

in the plans.

It is reported that the Funk family of Arizona,

owners of Las Vegas Downs dog racing track,

is planning to reopen the facility.

There is also a rumor going around Hender-

son that seems to be more than just idle talk. It

concerns the possibility of building a large

hotel/casino in Henderson, something the

town fathers know is the most needed com-

modity there. And, the names mentioned of

those possibly interested are impressive indeed,

with the Sahara/Hacienda Hotels' Paul Lowden

included among them.

If that were to happen, it could only mean

more growth and prosperity in the biggest little

town in Nevada: Henderson . .. of course!

me to stay with you?" Almost no one was

aware that Florence actually believed that she

herself, instead of Tina Mucklow, should have

remained with Cooper as his hostage when the

plane headed south from Seattle towards Reno

because she felt that she had grown to know

and understand him, in however strange a way.

"He told me, like a spirit," she said with

poignant nostalgia in her voice, "that I

probably sat beside him somewhere else a

hundred years ago."' Florence, it is true,

developed a profound sympathy for the lonely

man while trying to comfort him in the back of

the plane.

Dr. Dick Simmons, a psychologist special-

izing in the field of abnormal perceptions, was

on the flight but stole only a cursory glance al

Cooper. Simmons pointed out that the further

people get away from an event the more they

ate inclined to remember it the way they think

it should have been. This is why some people

reported Cooper as being no more than 45

years old, he felt, since skyjacking is not

regarded as an occupation for the middle-aged.

But this qualification would not necessarily

apply in the case of Florence Schaffner, since

she had spent so much time with Cooper and

had obviously seen him clearly. Indeed,

Florence would be an ideal witness, especially

in view of her compassionate feelings for

Cooper and her rapt attention to even minor

details about him.

After weeks of searching for her I finally

found Florence Schaffner, and after winning

her confidence (she claimed that she had been

warned never to talk to anyone about the sky-

jacking and reluctantly declined to allow us to

publish her photograph with this article) was

"able to learn many new and surprising facts

about the crime, startling details which proved

increasingly disturbing. To begin with,

This startling claim was the first hint ever by

an unwilling participant in the skyjacking that

the official version of the crime has been

erroneous from the beginning. Florence then

went on to confirm another aspect of Jack

Coffelt's story that had long puzzled me.

"Cooper took off his street shoes and put on a

pair of boots," she affirmed. Jack Coffelt, in

1974, had insisted that he changed into a pair

of boots on the plane. But press accounts,

quoting the FBI, had long ridiculed the "'hill-

sireet clothes. In fact, much of the FBI's long-

standing belief that Cooper died in the jump is

based on exactly this point, for after all,

wearing only thin oxford slippers, how could

he possibly survive the gruelling landing some-

where in the rugged forests of the Pacific

Northwest? But the FBI never even bothered,

it seems, to question Florence Schaffner

thoroughly.

The stewardess related many other relatively

minor points which nevertheless confirmed to

the last detail Jack Coffelt's version of the

crime. According to Florence, Cooper was —

just as Coffelt had said - the last person to

board the plane at Portland. Florence said that

she actually had to fetch him from where he

was peering out the terminal windows and lead

him to the entrance-way of the plane. Coffelt

told me that as he was peering out the terminal

windows, watching for a Brinks truck that was

supposed to deliver several million dollars -

the real target of the skyjacking - in unmarked

currency to the cargo hold of the 727, he

"almost got left behind." In fact, when the

Brinks truck failed to arrive as scheduled he

was standing there deliberating whether or not

to go ahead with the skyjacking when the girl

approached him. It was then that be decided to

demand the $200,000 for himself, his modest

cut of the few million dollars that was to have

been divided among other conspirators.

Florence remembered that Cooper was well-

dressed, wearing an old-fashioned black suit

as Coffelt had claimed, not a "brown" or

"dark" one as press accounts have always

reported. And she also recalled that he wore

white gloves, verifying Coffelt's claim that he

wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.

Her memory of that night was so clear, in

fact, that in a most surprising development

Florence insisted that she forgot to relay

Cooper's request that the ransom money be

collected in $20 bills; he refused to accept any

other denomination.

"I completely forgot

about that part," she said. *I was so scared at

the beginning of the whole thing." However,

if no denomination is specified it is standard

procedure for the FBI to deliver such ransom

are much easier to trace. But even though

Florence forgot to tell anyone, Cooper was

nevertheless delivered the ransom money in

$20 bills by those on thc ground!

These perplexing and darkly disturbing de-

tails faded into the background, however,

evidence in the case. When I finally found her

in July of 1977, the pretty, half-Filipino

stewardess, who was then working for Frontier

Airlines in Denver, took one look at my photo-

graphs of Jack Coffelt, her mouth dropped

open, and she gasped,

"Oh my God! Where

did you get those? I never thought I would see

that face again! It's him! My God, il's him!"

James Brown (l.) and Jack Coffels at Bannock,

Montana during their 1974 journey to Oregon. Photo

by Byron Brown.

At various times, FBI agents close to the

case have expressed the opinion that Jack

Coffelt's story was too littered with "James

Bondery" to be given any credibility. All his

"wild bluster" about beepers sending out

homing signals from a hidden jeep, fires set up

on the ground as signal lights, and accomplices

standing by with walkie-talkies evoked 100

much of a Hollywood aura. Why not just hide

the parachutes instead of spraying them with a

magnesium compound and torching them, as

Coffelt claimed he did?

Even after Florence Schaffner identified

Coffelt as the skyjacker, the FBI insisted that

he was nowhere near Oregon when the crime

took place, saying instead that he was then in

the Washington D.C. area. But they wouldn't

tell us where. "We've narrowed it down to

days and hours," one agent told me flaily.

"You've got the wrong man."

But one of Coffelt's most intimate acquain-

tances, his best friend and trusted confidant, in

fact, for nearly twenty years, Memphis attorney

Robert Dobbs, who provided the old con-man

with legal help more than once when Jack was

in trouble, told me: "Jack was meticulous

enough to have planned all the things"" neces-

sary to pull off the skyjacking. And for anyone

who doubted it: "... then they don't know

the real Jack Coffelt! You'd have to know

Coffeli personally to be able to appreciate the

significance of all of it!"

As tantalizing proof of his claim, Dobbs

went to his library and brought back two valu-

able relics straight from the dusky corridors of

American history: the exquisitely carved ivory

riding crop (a gift-te the 16th President from

the Emperor of Japan) and the gold pocker-

watch and fob of Abraham Lincoln! "Jack

gave me these once as payment for my legal

services," he explained with a wink. The

amazing story of how Jack came to acquire

these relics reveals yet another one of the intri-

cate and sophisticated scams which were clearly

his modus operandi before he undertook the

boldest of them all and the crown of his career:

the skyjacking.

I had learned about Robert Dobbs and his

association with Coffelt in a curious fashion, A

friend of his had once received a cookbook

from Jack as a gift. This friend, upon being

interviewed during our long investigation of

Coffelt, produced the cookbook. Inside was

discovered a crumpled letter meshed between

two pages. It was a 1969 correspondence to

Jack from Robert Dobbs! Dobbs had written

Jack, who was then involved in a particularly

shady affair in Washington D.C., to warn

him: "I think it would be ill-advised to meet

with you at this time unless we could be

absolutely certain that you were not being

followed." He then closed with the stark

advice: "Burn shis letter. "

Prominent Memphis attorney Robert L. Dobbs,

Coffelt's best friend for nearly twenty years, placed

Jack in Porsland at the time of the skyjacking.

When I tracked him down and told him that

Jack had forgotten to burn his letter, Dobbs

nevertheless managed a hearty laugh. "We

never put much in writing to each other," he

mused.

"Perhaps Jack wanted so koep that

letter as a souvenir. " Half-expecting a denial,

I informed Dobbs that Jack had confessed to

being D.B. Cooper. The cagey attorney Mashed

a knowing smile.

*I had a feeling he was in-

volved in that thing," he replied without a

trace of surprise in his voice. "You see, Jack

would often call me, even from as far away as

Europe or the Caribbean, wherever he was, to

tell me that he was into something and if he

didn't call back at a certain time for me to start

checking. Well, when that thing happened I

suspected Jack was involved in it... because

right before the styjacking he called me from

Portland, Oregon!"

(sop) A Northwest Boeing 727 with arrow pointing

to the rear stairsay ramp. (above) Mt. Hood,

Oregon. Coffelt returned twice to this area to search

for the lost money before his 1974 trip with the

BronzEs.

Myriad leads connected over the years like

the silken strands of a spider's web, one thin

trail joining another at obscure crossroads

along a pattern of seemingly infinite design.

My father and I were able to find witnesses in

Oregon who positively identified Jack as the

man who came to their gas station and recrea-

tion business twice, in the spring and fall of

1972, the year after the skyjacking. Along with

another to this day unidentified man, Jack

rented snowmobiles from them, driving the

vehicles into the hills behind their station near

the isolated jump site. These witnesses finally

confired Coffelt's claim that our trip with

him in 1974 to search for the lost money was

not the first time he had been back to that

remote place.

And finally, in a check of all the passengers

on Flight 305 as it left Portland Airport that

stormy Thanksgiving Eve, I discovered that a

prominent Seattle attorney, George LeBissoniere,

had sat only three seats away from D.B.

Cooper, so close that even the FBI told him

that he was one of their best eye-witnesses.

When Mr. LeBissoniere was shown photo-

graphs of Jack Coffelt, he caimly identified the

face as that of D.B. Cooper, unaware that

stewardess Florence Schaffner had already

identified the pictifes. "That Leavenworth

guy — right?" he asked, as if trying to refresh

his own memory. "I identified these same

pictures for the FBI six weeks after the sizi

jacking." (refer to sidebar p. 68)

"There's a somebody I'm longing to see ...

Someone who'll watch over me."

—Ira Gershwin

Jack Coffelt proudly called himself a "Jay-

hawker"' after a fictitious bird imagined by the

Indians to possess the haughty pride of a Blue

Jay and the cunning determination of a hawk.

But in truth he was a Caucasian harboring an

ornery supply of Cherokee blood which made

his nature tum restless and rebellious.

He was born in that part of the Midwest

known as "the Badlands" because of the

robbers who have blossomed there like weeds

in mud-filled creek beds. Jesse James and the

Dalton Boys and Billy the Kid are only a few

of the colorful criminals who once plundered

this dust-ridden locale, which is also the major

home in America of the proud Cherokee

Indians - the bitter end of the Trail Of Tears.

According to Jack Coffelt and my father, who

wrote a book about the place while in Atlanta

Penitentiary together, life there in the 1920's

was picturesque but also incredibly bleak, I

quote from their book:

"Stranger, you are entering the Tri-State

District, a mining patch covering the corners

of three states - Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas.

The land is a flat stovelid. The sky is a pale

blue liquid. Clouds drift in circles. Rays of the

sun bounce and play tricks on the eyes. And in

mid-July dust is instep deep and the creeks are

shallow and ugly.

"The town of Picher is the hub of this district.

Powder-monkeys send

groans and rumbles

through the earth and view with suspicion any

man who receives more than two letters a

week. Sidewashed lead and zinc glitter bold

across jig tables. Mines and chatpiles crowd

each other around the town. On the chatpiles

children scavenge for empty bottles and used

condoms. Renniker the junk dealer pays two

cents each for short pints and half pints, a cent

for beer and home brew, thirty cents a pound

for washed rubbers. Vern Wilders runs the big

game. A whorehouse sits on Main Street.

That's it, Stranger. Picher, Oklahoma, has

been sent for, went, and gualified."

Coffelt was born under an ill-star or Febru-

ary 20, 1916, to a poverty-stricken family. In

this inauspicious environment he quickly

learned the benefits of a fast tongue and a slip-

pery hand as he worked the booming lead and

zine mines by day and hung around the gam-

bling halls and brothels at night as a mere

youngster. When he was eight years old his

father, Walter Coffelt, who had once owned a

mine but lost it to booze, died of alcoholism,

leaving his widow Ottie and Jack and his two

sisters destitute. Ottie took up with another

man called Ben Wooldridge who, according to

Jack's sister, "was horribly mean to us kids."

The children fled, The two young girls — ages

sixteen and fourteen - married off as soon as

possible. Jack continued in school, according

to one prison record, through the seventh grade

or to about 1929. Then he dropped out for

good when he was about thirteen years old.

His common-law stepfather, Ben Wooldridge,

was also dead by that time, another victim of

the bottle.

When Jack was only fifteen he broke into his

grandfather's grocery store in nearby Baxter

Springs, Kansas with a "false key" and,

according to the courthouse records there,

"stole diverse bars of candy and packages of

gum and $10 in silver. " His irate grandfather

insisted on pressing charges and on May 20,

1932, Jack was convicted of burglary and

larceny, third degree, and sentenced to the

Kansas State Industrial Reformatory at Hutch-

inson for a term "not to exceed five years."

He was just sixteen years old. This was the

beginning of the 20 years, eight months, and

13 days of his life that he was to spend in

various jails and prisons. Two years later,

when he was eighteen, he arrived at the for-

bidding rock-walled fortress of McAlester

prison in dreary southeastern Oklahoma for a

three-year stretch upon being convicted for yet

another burglary after his parole from the

Kansas reformatory. His path in life - that of

a hardened criminal - was already well-

None of the charges he was ever convicted

on, however, were for crimes of violence -

unless you count grabbing a deputy's pistol in

an escape attempt. "Jack said prison was

awful. They'd never keep him locked up again

— he'd escape," remembers his sister. Incar-

ceration must have been terrible to him. One

prison medical report states that in 1947 Jack

underwent "two operations ten weeks apart"

for being cruelly kicked in the "left groin,"

and the same report later states obliquely that

"this prisoner has history of gunshot wound

left foot." Had he been shot there? In 1974

Jack expressed nothing but hatred for the prison

authorities, telling me vengefully, "I always

wanted to get them back for what they did to

me!"*

His prison "rap sheet" was nearly impossible

10 obtain. At one point in our investigation,

after we had secretly procured a copy of it, the

government even tried to confiscate it on

grounds that it was "federal property." But it

makes long and often humorous reading, in-

cluding items such as this one contained in his

Atlanta Penitentiary Admissions Summary:

"Presently he got into a reform school in

Kansas where he was further disillusioned by

indications of corruptions on the part of some

of the officials and employees of the institu-

tion!" On May 19, T949, Jack began a ten-year

sentence at Atlanta Penitentiary for interstate

auto theft and attempted escape upon being

rudely caught, and by that time he was un-

swervingly bitter towards "the system." His

dossier then best explains his state of mind:

DB Cooper-20792

ti!

"He claims that he has been a professional

gambler for years and in fact that he has never

earned an honest dollar. He denies guilt on the

current charge and states that fully half of his

prison sentences have been based purely upon

his record and were therefore unjust."*

At Atlanta Pen Coffelt met my father, James

Brown, a former Air Force pilot. Brown had

worked as a reporter during his younger days

and was a good writer, often compiling and

editing the prison magazine single-handedly,

while Coffelt was the press operator who

printed it. They became good friends and spent

three years filling the dreary days together by

working on a long writing project

about

Coffelt's early life. My father was paroled in

1952. After his friend was gone, Coffelt trans-

ferred to Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas

to finish out his sentence, and there, on July

20, 1955, he was "conditionally released" -

pending parole restrictions. He would be in a

few small-town jails after that, but never

another "awful" penitentiary.

In his new life on the outside Jack Coffelt

emerged for the first time as a human being

rather than a number. He was immensely proud

of the book he had written with my father.

Entitled Cleave The Liquid Sky, the novel, a

colorful and spellbinding account of Coffelt's

boyhood years in Oklahoma, was never pub-

lished. But nevertheless, "with a book under

my belt," as Jack told people, he had "finally

achieved something." He had greatly matured

and no longer wanted to be merely a petty thief.

Instead, he would become a shrewd con-man.

As a result of one scam in Memphis,

Tennessee, in the late 1950's, Jack came into a

pile of money — around $50,000 — and with a

healthy bank account to bolster his ego he

grew courteous and extremely generous. He

always grabbed the check when he took friends

out to expensive restaurants and plush night-

spots. He was charming, a "*hell of a salesman"

said one companion. He drank and smoked

heavily. He often fascinated and regaled people

with preposterous accounts of his past criminal

exploits: wild tales of blowing open safes with

nitroglycerin (carrying it in a vial aroand his

neck so it would stay at body temperature),

and dramatic holdups during drunken sprees of

cross-country travelling. (*'F'm gonna pur you

in the news — bang!**)

Coffelt was always a chamcleon - wonder-

fully gifted in producing a vast range of

personalities to suit the mood of any occasion.

Referring to the same period of time,

one

person who knew him remembered, "He was

really a remarkable man. Very kind, very

generous, very colorful, almost like a kindly

uncle," while another recalled, "I always had

the feeling he could easily tear the room

apart!" But he was steadfastly hypnotic. "The

average person had no defense to him. He just

mesmerized people," said his old friend

Robert Dobbs, the Memphis attorney who re-

ceived a call from Jack from Portland, Oregon,

days before the skyjacking. Among these

crowds, however, Jack always seemed to be

ashamed of his prairie roots and the bitter

poverty he experienced in his youth, poverty

which had led him irreversibly, he believed,

into a life of crime.

In early February of 1960 Jack's mother

Ottie died a horrible death when her home

burned to the ground in Baxter Springs, Kansas.

Jack attended the funeral. He wore expensive

suits and drove a late-model Cadillac, evasively

telling relatives that he was "working back

East somewhere." Where is not certain, but a

year later, after meeting his red-haired conti-

dante Tave in Las Vegas, Jack became per-

manently established in the Washington D.C.

area.

He never held a steady job there, but at

various times he managed to come into "large

sums of money" according to Tave herself -

tens of thousands of dollars at the drop of a hat,

To close friends he hinted that he was a "bag-

man," someone hired by the Mafia to distribute

bribes among crooked politicians. But then,

one of his old Kansas cronies who visited him

in Washington in the late 1960's watched J.

Edgar Hoover,

the FBI Director, throw a

warm and friendly bearhug around Jack.

Coffelt, it seems, had learned to play both

sides of the fence shrewdly and with great

finesse. He had finally become a valuable

commodity.

Whatever murky substrata of society his

operations belonged to, they were never, it

seems, restricted entirely to the nation's capital.

As one intimate source wrote, "I don't know

if you are aware of the long 'tentacles' Jack

had. in other parts of the world," It was

a dark hint at the vast Rosicrucian circles

which the shrewd con-man had learned to

move in during those years of especially shady

"power politics" when internationally moti-

vated plots of intrigue ran rife in the capital.

"That part of your letter where you said you

weren't sure that I was real tickled me,"

Coffelt responded to one enthralled disbeliever.

"I'm as real as I appear."

But this "modern Indian warrior," as my

father and others often thought of Jack, finally

fell prey to the white man's fated disease -

Love. Those who knew Jack and Tave said he

always referred to her as his "sister" or

"cousin," never anything more. Most were of

this opinion, summed up by one: "She always

seemed to be watching him, like a plastic doll,

in some sort of oftitial capacity."

But then, in the latter half of the 1960's,

along came another girl - a beautiful German

blonde who was a research scientist. Jack

"procured" her, as he himself described it.

Her version: "*I do everything Jack orders.

DB Cooper-20794

Whatever he tells me to do, I do." What they

did was set into operation a bizarre plos to

wrest away the fortune from a famous multi-

millionaire jet-setter! But this incredible scam

which involved an illegitimate child, court-

ordered blood tests, hush-money paid to poli-

ticians, and sealed court testimony describing

activities bordering on the occult, backfired

ignominiously.

Jack came under intense pressure by the early

1970's to get out of Washington D.C. or face

the threat of another long prison sentence, or

even worse punishment at the hands of those

who sought to keep a lid on the scam! The

beautiful German girl secretly set sail for

Europe on an ocean-liner. She would hide out

in France and Germany, finally neutral

Switzerland where American agents were un-

able to bribe that government's politicians into

turning her over. Jack, from afar, constantly

supplied her with money, draining his own re-

sources to the end.

"I never loved anyone like I loved her,"

Coffelt told me in 1974 as tears welled in his

eyes. By 1971 his luck had at last run dry. The

days of free spending and high living were

over, leaving him more embittered than ever

before. More than one person who knew him

then recalled, "He said he was going to "get

the govemment. *"*To me, his constant refrain

about the skyjacking - "I had nothing to

lose"' - always became deeply intertwined

around the story of his passionate love for the

beautiful German geisha!

Henry James once wrote, stretching irony to

its furthest limit: "It is far better to be killed

than to be destroyed." The colorful and fasci-

nating Jack Coffelt was plotting, however, one

Jast way to beat the "system." In November

1971, as Nixon's White House flourished and

the Vietnam War raged on, Bryant "Jack"

Coffelt became an American legend by para-

chuting from an airplane with a bag of stolen

толеу.

A bland grey stone lying in an obscure comer

of a Hawaiian cemetery bears the simple

legend: Bryant Coffelt - [born| February 20,

1916; (died] June 19, 1975. But the stone -

which may one day prove as cryptic as Rosetta's

- tells nothing more about the dark circum-

stances surrounding Jack's days in Hawaii,

why he went there, or what he dad. It is known,

however, among other things, that his death

certificate has been secretly altered.

In Hawaii, the palm fans sway in gentle

breezes, mangos and pineapples fill the air

with tropical aromas, and the emerald ocean

fades before sunset to what Jack would fondly

call "indigo blue." Peaceful surfs splash the

sand-swept beaches like time itself coming

home to rest. At last, perhaps, Jack has found

a serenity that he never knew in life.

The FBI has finally admitted that Jack was a

During the course of our investigation my father and I hired a Las Vegas private detective

agency to procure a copy of Jack Coffelt's death certificate from the Research and Statistics

Office at the Hawaii Department of Health. But we were promptly informed by the detective

agency that the Hawaii FBI had been somehow "alerted" by its inquiry there — a very

strange occurrence indeed. Why would the Bureau be alerted?

Tave Coffelt, who is listed as the "informant," apparently stated at the top of the docu-

ment (item #10) that she and Jack "never married." Note the addition marked "ALTERED

June 30, 1975" in the lower right half of the certificate. To alter a death certificate requires

at least a number of official signatures from various government agencies, if not a court

order. Why was the certificate changed (and by whom?) I1 days after it was issued to show

that Coffelt died on June 19 at 12:40 AM rather than on June 18 at 11:25 PM? It is a differ-

ence of not quite an hour, but legally it shifts the death one day later. Even though no autopsy

was performed (item #19a), the body was not buried until one week after that, on June 24th.

Did Coffelt's friends fly in from around the world for an extended wake before the funeral?

It seems bighly unlikely.

Only weeks before June 19, 1975, Jack Coffelt was seen by old friends of his 5000 miles

away - back in Kansas! And in a letter to my father dated September 20, 1976, nearly a

year and a half after Jack's alleged death, Tave Coffelt used a strange verb tense in referring

to him: "Jack knows," she eerily began, "so many people throughout the worid and so

many would be interested. in information which they think I might provide them, it

would only result in their coming here to see me, which I do not want. "

Many unanswered questions still linger ...

In another letter just one week after that, responding to a direct inquiry about whether she

knew for certain if Jack was D.B. Cooper, Tave did not deny that he was, but instead replied

with the cryptic warning: "The subject to which you referred to (the skyjacking]... in my

opinion is a can of worms — and could only result in trouble in the future!"'

major suspect in the skyjacking all along. Out

of 933 suspects in the D.B. Cooper case,

Coffelt was "in the top 20" of those the Bureau

had spent the most man-hours working on -

according to Agent Gary Penrith, then in charge

of the FBI's anti-hijacking unit at headquarters

in Washington D.C. 'We can't rule him out,"

Penrith admitted.

It is virtually certain that Coffelt was the

skyjacker. Solely because of our efforts, two

people have identified him as D.B. Cooper, he

has been placed in Portland when the crime

occurred, physical evidence has been found

confirming where he jumped, and a mass of

circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly

supports all the details of his story. More than

anything, Jack was afraid of slow destruction.

After spending half of his adult life that way,

he wanted no more of poverty or lonely prison

cells. He was stunned to the very essence of

his being by the crime's horrible failure — this

perverse modern tragedy which so miserably

revealed the fatal flaw of rabid pride which

stained his character. As Robert Dobbs,

Coffelt's trusted Memphis confidant put it:

*He would laugh Death in the face if he thought

he could pull something over on somebody...

and Jack always wanted to do one big thing

before he left here!"

no-shows on the holiday-season flight.

Nearly 80 seats were vacant. She also

seemed puzzled when Cooper passed

her a handwritten note soon after take-

off. Flo had long been accustomed to

amorous travelers. Her small, trim figure

and jet-black hair attracted bankers and

college football players alike. They were

always flirting and passing her little love

notes. Some of these messages were cute.

Others were funny. A few were sexy.

But this one was different.

It said nothing about later tonight or

make sense: Bomb in briefcase... will

Schaffner looked again at the swarthy

passenger who had handed her the slip

of paper, He seemed to be in his 40s,

with a receding hairline, about six feet

tall and of medium build. Dressed in a

reddish-brown business suit, white shirt,

flashy alligator shoes, a narrow black tie

and a stickpin, he wasn't a bad-looking

guy. But he seemed sort of distant.

Earlier, when the plane was ready for

takeoff, the stewardess had had to go

down the ramp to summon Cooper, who

was watching the baggage being loaded.

He boarded only after the cargo doors

were closed, removing his hat and dark

glasses while Schaffner served him a

double bourbon-on-the-rocks. He quick-

ly gulped it down. Sitting in the win-

dow seat with a briefcase in his lap, he

looked for all the world like any other

businessman.

He must

be a prankster, Schaffner

thought. Some men would do just any-

thing to get her attention. She stuffed

the note into her jacket pocket and

started to move forward in the cabin to

serve the other passengers. But when she

looked at Cooper, the fierce determina-

partner. e

tion in his narrow-set eyes stopped her

cold. His head jerked, angrily,

toward

the briefcase he held open. Inside she

saw a large battery, several red sticks

and a tangle of wires.

"Sit down here, please," he ordered in

a firm voice.

She quickly concluded that the red

sticks were dynamite and that the bal-

tery was part of a bomb. This wasn't a

joke, after all. Her pulse quickened

and her stomach churned as she ap-

proached Cooper cautiously.

Within minutes the stewardess had

relayed his demands to the cockpit, and

copilot William Rataczak was in com-

munication with Seattle-Tacoma Inter-

national Airport tower officials.

if he didn't receive $200,000 and four

parachutes as soon as the plane landed

at Seattle.

Tense airport personnel notified

Northwest Airlines officials and the FBI,

who decided to meet the skyjacker's

demands. When Flight

305

reached

Seattle, il circled in the vicinity for two-

and-a-half hours while airline represen-

tatives gathered the money from four

banks-all in S20 bills-and recorded

the serial numbers.

"We were told there was a minor me-

chanical problem," remembers Seattle

attorney George LaBissoniere, who was

seated two rows in front of Cooper. "I

walked to thé bathroom a couple of

times and passed him, but at no time did

we know there was a hijacker aboard.

Everyone remained calm, and the drinks

were on the house."

When the plane finally landed at

Seattle, Cooper's 36 fellow passengers

and Flo Schaffner and another steward-

ess disembarked. Cooper had demanded

that one stewardess remain on board as

a hostage. Tina Muchlow didn't consid-

er herself especially brave, but some-

body had to volunteer. Now she was on

her own.

Also remaining on the plane was the

three-man fight crew, headed by Cap-

tain William Scott. Four sport parachutes

were delivered and left just inside one of

the cabin doors. A short time later an

FBI agent walked slowly up the ramp

and silently handed Muchlow a heavy

canvas mailbag containing the ran-

som money,

Struggling to get a better grip on the

46-pound moneybag, she turned into

the darkened cabin. The shades had

been pulled shut on all the porthole-

shaped windows. Cooper was too smart

to let himself be picked off by police

sharpshooters. Behind Muchlow, in the

cockpit, the flight crew waited for fur-

ther instructions now that the plane had

been refueled. In front of her, hidden

somewhere in the shadows of the empty

seats, was D. B. Cooper-and his bomb.

As she walked slowly down the aisle,

Muchlow's foot struck a strange object.

For a frightening instant she thought

she might have kicked the bomb. She

sensed the man was somehow going to

get away with his bold plan.

Still holding the stewardess, Cooper's

hand slipped down to the swell of her

hips. She sucked in her breath and

remained motionless as his fingers ex-

plored the shape of her round, firm ass.

His other hand started to reach for the

proud peaks of her bosom. But suddenly

he seemed to change his mind.

Releasing her, he bent down and

picked up the mailbag.

"Yep, it's all here," Cooper said, plop-

ping the satchel onto the nearest

cushioned seat.

"Aren't you going to count it?"

Muchlow asked, straightening her skirt

and jacket, relieved to be free from him.

"I trust 'em," he smiled. Opening the

bag, he pulled out a fistful of twenties

and offered them

to her. "Here," he

said. "Call it a tip."

"Oh, no," she stammered, "we're not

allowed to accept gratuities."

Cooper shrugged, and dropped the

money back into the bag. "Are the

chutes aboard?"

"They're up front."

"Bring them back here, then shut the

door. We're getting outa here. Fast!"

Grabbing a microphone at the stew-

ardesses' station, Cooper ordered the

crew to fly him to Mexico City. Pilot

William Scott explained that that

destination was outside the aircraft's

range; they would have to stop to refuel.

"Then make it Reno," the skyjacker

snapped. "And let's get this motherfuck-

ing show on the road!"

Shortly after takeoff he ordered the

pilots to unlock the 727's rear passenger

ramp, remain at exactly 10,000 feet

altitude, fly at a 200-mph cruising speed

with wing flaps down at a I5-degree an-

gle and maintain a particular compass

setting. Obviously, Cooper knew exact-

ly what he was doing.

After instructing the pilot to fly the

direct course to Reno, he gave

stewardess a final smile and closed her

inside the cockpit with the flight crew.

The last thing she remembers seeing was

Cooper removing his street shoes and

putting on a pair of heavy work boots,

which he had taken from a paper bag.

Cooper monitored the flight with a com-

pass and wrist altimeter. Since the rear

exit door had been, left open on

. Cooper,

two

parachutes, the mailbag and the attache

case had vanished. All he left behind

were some lengths of cut-up parachute

shroud line--and reams of speculation

concerning his fate.

The FBI claims it expended thou-

sands of man-hours tracking down leads

on some 900 suspects, without success.

Its conclusion is that Cooper, or what-

ever his real name was, probably per-

ished in the jump. Official line aside,

many observers familiar with the case

suggest that Cooper was actually an ex-

convict named Byron (Jack) Coffelt.

They cite, in part, convincing evidence

supplied by James Brown-a former

Army officer who shared a cell with

Coffelt at the Atlanta Federal Penitenti-

ary. At various intervals from June 1973

until his death in June 1975, Coffelt told

Brown intimate details of the skyjacking

and its aftermath that nobody except

someone with firsthand knowledge of

the incident could possibly have known.

Until then Brown knew surprisingly

little about his old cellmate's past histo-

ry. Coffelt, a hard drinker who stood six

feet tail and weighed 190 pounds, was

always shrouded in mystery. And un-

doubtedly that's the way he wanted it.

Born in 1916, he spent much of his first

30 years in Midwestern jails for a variety

of minor crimes. In 1949 he received a

ten-year sentence for interstate transpor-

tation of a stolen automobile. Over the

years his cellmates in the Atlanta and

Leavenworth federal prisons reportedly

included Colonel Jack Durant, who was

convicted of stealing the Hesse crown

jewels during World War II, and James

Earl Ray, who is presently serving a lite

sentence for killing Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr.

During those prison years Coffelt ap-

parently made contact with the FBI. A

source who requests anonymity men-

tions a letter signed by J. Edgar Hoover

asking the prison warden for infor.

mation about Coffelt. The source also

says that the agent in charge of the At.

lanta FBI office was Coffelt's sole visitor

for five years.

Some believe that he became an FBI

informant in prison, secretly

turning

over information damaging to his cell-

mates. To Brown, Coffelt described his

time behind bars as a "revolving door" —

meaning that he would be let out for a

for the government.

The combination of a strong wind and

the early chute opening caused him to

drift far from the target meadow. Coffelt

hit the ground hard at more than 30

mph, was dragged along by the para-

chute and smacked into a dead tree.

Despite the pain from injuries to his

rib cage, genitals, feet and legs, he man-

aged to remove the chutes. To avoid

possible detection, he melted them with

an aerosol can of solvent spray. Then he

buried what was left of the chutes—

mostly metal snaps and buckles-next

to a large rock, on which he scratched

large X's and O's.

Coffelt now considered his very real

dilemma. He could hear the signals from

the beepers in both the Jeep and the lost

moneybag, but the latter was weak and

beginning to fade. He thought about

going after the money, but quickly dis-

missed the plan when he realized he

Coffelt began working as a surgical tech-

nician at a northern Virginia hospital.

His superior there says that he had diffi-

culty walking and at one point showed

her his "badly discolored legs"-in-

juries that some believe he sustained in

The following spring, after the snow

had melted, Coffelt said he chartered a

helicopter and returned to the area. But

when the pilot became unduly curious

about the object of the search, Cof-

felt abandoned his efforts to locate the

A few years later he told James Brown

that he wanted to go back into the Cas-

cades and look for the small fortune, but

that he needed help, In July 1974 the

two men and Brown's muscular 17-

year-old son made a week-long trek into

the mountains where Coffelt said he

landed. Coffelt was then in ilt health,

and at one point he nearly collapsed on

a steep grade. For the entire week they

made themselves as invisible as possible,

blending into the forest, keeping camp-

fires low, meticulously picking up after

themselves. But they found no money in

the rugged terrain.

Meanwhile, Brown had been writing

down every scrap of information Coffelt

told him. He began working on a

manuscript following Coffelt's death in

1975. To sell the story, Brown found

producer Dirk Summers in Las Vegas,

where he was supervising a Kenny Nor-

ton heavyweight fight for CBS Sports.

Summers says that he had Brown take

a lie-detector test concerning the time

he spent with Coffelt in northern

Oregon. "He passed with flying colors,"

claims Summers.

"But all that meant

was that Brown believed Coffelt's story.

I kept thinking, if this story is true, it's

the story of the century."

So Summers began his own investiga-

tion. In 1977 he and Brown organized

an expedition into the Cascades, back to

where Coffelt had taken Brown three

years earlier. This time, thanks to a

metal-detector and energetic digging,

the search party unearthed a solid piece

of physical evidence: a one-and-a-half-

inch piece of cording that proved to be

synthetic nylon of the type used in

parachute shrouding.

"We had a lab report confirming that

the cording came from a parachute and

was five to seven years old," says Sum-

mers. "We were very careful uncovering

it. I took soil samples, which l turned

over to the lab so I would know whether

something hadn't just been buried there.

It's a strong piece of circumstantial

"The area where we found this was

very primitive, remote wilderness- Big-

foot country. We had to lower ourselves

down a cliff to get to the site. There was

a dead tree that Jack told Brown he hit.

And this enormous, two-story-high rock

with markings on it: X's and O's that

Coffelt said he had scratched into the

rock the night he landed there. That was

where we dug. You could even see the

narrow trenches where his feet had hit

the ground and he had been dragged by

the parachute."

Summers became a believer in the sto-

ry, and he too is convinced that Jack

Coffelt was D. B. Cooper. He has fin-

ished a book on the subject, and claims

to have interested actors Robert Mitch-

um and Telly Savalas in a TV project.

Summers and Brown also believe that

the FBI went to great lengths to cover up

and otherwise derail the Coffelt/Cooper

connection. The producer suspects that

the FBI may have known all along that

Coffelt was the skyjacker, but didn't go

after him because they realized he had

stories to tell about his earlier coopera-

tion with the agency.

"Assistant and

deputy FBI directors are involved in the

Coffelt story," says Summers. "It's a

string of middle-level officials covering

up and protecting their own asses."

Many observers closest to the case are

still perplexed by the way it was han-

dled. According to reliable sources, Flo

Schaffner and Tina Muchlow-the two

stewardesses on board Flight 305 who

could identify Cooper-said the FBI

released a composite of the skyjacker

that looked nothing like him,

though they had worked closely with an

viewed extensively and gave agents

says the stewardesses told him the FBI

threatened thist with legal action and

possible prosecution if he continued with

his Coffelt investigation. Worse yet, Sum-

mers says FBI agents contacted persons

who had talked to him and warned them

against cooperating further.

George LaBissoniere. In the past year

soth have identified a photograph of

Coffelt as the skyjacker. Interestingly,

saBissoniere says he previously iden-

ified an FBI photo of Coffelt a month

after the incident. As far as he knows,

nothing more ever happened as a result

_of the identification. He tried contacting

he FBI several times, but no one at the

Jureau ever returned his calls.

Also supporting Coffelt's story are

unusual details of the skyjacking that he

sold Brown, facts that have never been

released by lawmen or published by

Coffelt said he "petted and touched"

the stewardess in an intimate way and

offered her some of the ransom money.

The "groping" has been confirmed by a

member of the fight crew, Larsen

verifies Coffelt's claim that he changed

into boots on the plane. To this day, all

news reports have echoed the FBI's

claim that he jumped in street shoes.

Earlier this year the D. B. Cooper sto-

ry stormed back onto the front pages

when some of the ransom money was

recovered -not by any of the hopeful

treasure-hunters who have prowled the

jump region for years, but purely by ac-

cident. On February 12, during a family

outing on the northern bank of the Co-

lumbia River, eight-year-old Brian

Ingram was scooping out sand for a

campfire site. Suddenly he shouted:

"Daddy, I see money!" His father dug

further and found 12 packets of crum-

bling $20 bills wrapped in worn rubber

bands. "It didn't look like I could spend

it,"' says Harold Ingram. "I thought it

The discovery was made about 50

miles downstream from where Coffelt

said he landed and some 20 miles away

from where the FBI searched for

Cooper's landing spot. If the money had

dropped at either location, it would

have had to work its way down a tribu;

tary and eventually into the wide river.

Although the bills, apparently did just

that, the landing spot or exact route the

money followed in the river will prob-

ably never be determined, since earth

was freely moved from one river to an-

other during a massive dredging oper-

ation in 1977 and 1978.

The currency's serial numbers did,

however, match those on some of the

bills given Cooper in 197L. Despite

massive digging by the FBI and local

police during the next several days, no

more ransom money was found.

Those who believe that Jack Coffelt

may have been D. B. Cooper feel that

finding the money did nothing to con-

tradict his version of the skyjacking.

"After all, Coffelt did claim he lost the

money," one journalist familiar with the

The FBI agent in charge of the case

from the beginning, Ralph Himmels-

bach, declines to discuss details of

Coffelt's story or his alleged connections

to the Bureau. Besides, he thinks it

unlikely that D. B. Cooper ever pulled

"The aircraft was flying at 10,000 feet

at nearly 200 mph," says Himmelsbach.

"The air temperature outside was

minus-seven degrees. Winds in Portland

were gusting at ground level up to 40

mph. He was plunging straight down at

26 mph, the normal rate of vertical de-

scent in sport parachuting. Add those

two numbers together, and he had to

strike the ground at nearly 70 mph. It's

hard to conceive how he could have

landed without being badly injured.

Also, he lacked the necessary equipment

to make such a jump. He should have

had a hard hat, goggles, a leather flight

jacket, a flight suit and some tools and

cutters so he could free himself from

whatever trees or bushes he might have

gotten hung up in.

"It was an incredible gamble. Yet he

was dressed in a suit, with a tie and

stickpin, alligator shoes, a raincoat and

dark glasses and carrying a briefcase. He

seemed to be saying, 'If I make it, okay.

If I don't, that's okay too.""

And what about the report from

stewardess Muchlow that she saw him

change from his street shoes to boots be-

fore the jump? "That's news to me,"

Himmelsbach says gruffly.

A tough, old investigator, he retired

from the Bureau a month after the

Ingrams found some of the ransom

money, Nevertheless, Himmelsbach's

compulsion with solving his biggest-ever

case has not ended. A private pilot, he

still flies his single-engine Beechcraft

Bonanza over the rugged terrain that he

hopes hides the decaying parachutes

and bones of D. B. Cooper. Clearly, he

does not relish the prospect that the sky-

jacker survived the jump and lived to

spend most of the money.

And he has nothing but contempt for

the townspeople of Ariel, Washington,

who commemorate the famous skyjack-

ing. "They're making fun of a deadly

serious matter," Himmelsbach declares.

In April 1972, all three stewardesses of the hijacked

When MC COY's home was searched after his arrest by the

After MC COY was convicted and received a 45-year

sentence for the UNITED AIRLINES hijacking, no attempt was made

parachuted into dense woods in the southern part of the state of

Washington.

COOPER instructed the NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES pilot

to fly south after taking off from Seattle/Tacoma International

He did not specify any direction nor any vector that

should be flown nor did he specify any changes while in flight.

It was clear from this command that COOPER did not particularly

care where the plane went as long as it went south from Seattle.

This would tend to imply that COOPER was not being met on the

ground by an accomplice nor did he intend to find something he

had left on the ground such as a car or clothing or other

paraphernalia to aid him after he reached the ground subsequent

to his parachuting from the airplane.

In view of this it would have been necessary for UNSUB

to have landed on the ground on the evening of 11/24/71, at about

8:00 p.m. and somewhere in a dense wooded area in southern

Washington and somehow have made it back to his home in Provo,

Utah, by 10:00 a.I. the next morning. He was observed in his

completely rested without marks or physical injuries of any

kind by the above-named Brigham Young UniversityI

seems highly unlikely that an individual would have been able to

maneuver from the wooded area in Washington to Provo, Utah,

without taking some sort of airplane transportation to do so.

The nearest airport to where UNSUB would have landed in southern

Washington was the Portland airport which was the airport at

which the NORJAK hijacking originated.

During the evening of

11/24/71, it was quite busy with law enforcement personnel of all

kinds including FBI Agents in and about the airport conducting

interviews and conducting other investigation.

In view of the above information, it seems unlikely

that MC COY is identical with UNSUB subject in this matter.

of

was

one of the USAF aviation cadets at Hondo Air Base, TexasX

He was disorganized and preoccupied. Though the academic schedule

was posted well in advance, he would study the wrong subjects,

and was a marginal student. In the flight phase of his training,

he soloed the PA-18 Cub without serious problems, but barely

made it in the more advanced T-6.

on the occasion of his first night cross-country flight, he

nade all the required radio calls (engine start, taxi, takeoff,

In 1971, he was approximately

years old, - assuming he did

not falsify his age in 1954, when he entered the pre-flight

phase of Aviation Cadet training.

I have never mentioned this before, even though I have seen that

program several times. First, the similarity in appearance is

not too convincing, since it was an artist's drawing, not a

photograph. Second, I didn't (and still don't) want to embarrass

"D.B. Cooper,any problems for him. Third, I always hoped that

would be identified. Fourth, if I had to bet on

it, I would bet it is not the same man, because the appear-

face.

RE: D.B. COOPER

Dear Duty Agent;

I am sending this letter at the request of the Duty Agent of April 27th. I have mixed

feelings about providing this information since I am not certain that it is totally reli-

able. I also believe that the statute of limitations may have run out on this case.

In November I saw a composite drawing of D.B. Cooper on TV. At that time I was

certain that it was someone Lknew. I later talked with the individual and

learned that he had been

Western Airlines. I also learned that he was

(is?) a sky diver. He changed careers after beingL

I He left the country

and went to

working

in various locations in the US including Alaska.

In January I took his photograph which is enclosed. Perhaps you can check

it against your drawings. After this length of time I am no longer certain that

the picture I saw on TV does in fact resemble the photo.

One other, very subjective, thing. Although he has been nothing but civil and

triendly with me l have observed that he has a mean disposition with little

provocation.

If you feel there is any merit in pursuing this information 1 will then provide

you with a name and possible location of this individual.

A few words about myself. My husband and I are retired. I was

_We left Sar Diego five years agol

The Crime

on 11/24/71, the day before Thanksgiving, a lone white

male boarded Northwest Orient flight 305 at Portland, Oregon.

At

approximately 3:22 p.M., while the flight was enroute to Seattle,

washington, he indicated to the stewardess that his briefcase

contained a bomb, which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes in

Niel nee corest it at he stone to e toes a cient

parachutes and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and two

airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into the

first-class section of the aircraft and informed them he desired

to fly to Mexico City. The hijacker instructed that the plane

proceed in a southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and

slow speed, which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere between

Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the plane landed to

refuel.

It was determined the hijacker, two parachutes and the

cansom money had disappeared when the plane was inspected at

Reno, Nevada.

Artist's conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the FBI Exhibit Section and are considered a

reasonable likeness.

The black and white composite was preparec

initially and sometime later, the color composite was prepared to

depict the hijacker's complexion and age more graphically.

The hijacker is described as follows:

Race:

White

Sex:

Male

Age:

Mid-40's

Height:

5'10" - 6°

Weight:

170 to 180 lbs.

Complexion:

D.B. COOPER VS DAN COOPER

One of the first suspects in this case was

aka D.B. Cooper. The press learned of this fact anc

printed this information, indicating that was the name UNSUB usec

aboard the aircraft. The actual name on the flight manafest was

DAN COOPER.

Any potential suspect whose true last name is COOPER

should be carefully scrutinized for possible elimination.
