Wash., on a fugitive warrant irom Oklahoma.

The warrant charges Ingram with unlawfully remov-

The next day, Ingram turned the money over to the

"We live from paycheck to paycheck, and we could

boy who found part of skyjacker D.B. Cooper's ransom

money last month, bas been arrested in Vancouver,

Wash., on a fugitive warrant iron Obiahoma.

The warrant charges Ingram with unlawfully remov.

ing mortgaged property from the state of Oklahoma - a

felony charge that carries a maximum penalty'of three

jears in prison.

o Clari: County sheriff's deputies arrested Ingram at

his rented home in Vancouver Monday afternoon. He

was released Tuesday night after a local bail bondsman

posted Ingram's $500 bail, sheriff's deputies said.

Kathy Kelly, a legal assistant in the Clark County

Prosecuting Attorney's office, said Ingram is scheduled

to appear

in county

district court

April 17 for

an

same Harold Ingram sought in Oklahoma.

If he is, Kelly said, Oklahoma authorities will have 60

the sand along the banks of the Columbia River down

stream from Vancouver

The next day, ingram turned the money over to the

FBI, which announced the find with great fanfare at a

press conference featuring the Ingram family.

"Several of us read the paper and recognized bim,"

Roberts told The Associated Press.

"We had a warrant

sworn out to have him brought back."

Ingram's arrest is the latest in a string.of reversals

I that have followed his family's brief glow in the lime

light.

Two weeks after the money was discovered, ingrams:

Wife, Patricia, reported that her busband was forced to i

give up 1½ days of pay - about sico - in order tog

return the money and attend the FBI's press conference.

"We live from paycheck to paycheck, and we could y

sure use that $100," she told The Post-Intelligencer at the

time.

Mrs. Ingram told The P.I that recovery of the sbyjack

loot also resulted in family strife that arose when a

relative tried to take credit for finding the money.

Late Saturday night, about 33 hours before Ingram

Enclosed are four (4) artists composites,

wo black and white, and two color, depicting the

NORJAK unsub, aka DAN COOPER, D.B. COOPER, with and

without glasses.

THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient

Flight #305 at Portland,

regon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was

en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his

brief case contained a bomb

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions.

After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class

section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in

a

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

(Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

regon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his brief case contained a bomb

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions. After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class

section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

(Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

She noted in addition to the information she furnished

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Charlottesville, Virginia,

on April 11, 1980, John Scott Maze did

filter type but she could not recall the brand.

She also noted he was always extremely polite, even to

her whom he did not care for at all.

She noted the composite she identified as looking just

like John Scott Maze, looked like him without the "David Niven"

type mustache he always wore.

She also recalled he alwas talked at a low modulation as

he had an

adversity towards loud noise.

She added, she talks loud

and that was one of the things Maze did not like about her.

and if she locates anything which would be of further value to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Maze, she will contact

the interviewing Agent and'furnish it to him,

In conclusion she stated in her judgment, the composite

picture she identified is a picture of John Scott Maze, and Maze's

complexion was even more tan than the complexion depicted in the

colored composites when she last saw Maze in person in 1972.

Enclosed are four (4) artists composites,

two black and white,

NORJAK unsub, aka DAN COOPER, D.B. COOPER, with and

without glasses.

THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest

Orient

Flight #305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his brief case contained a bomb

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions. After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class

section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

(Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel. It was determined the hijacker,

two parachutes, and the ransom money had disappeared when

at Reno, Nevada.

Artist conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the FBI Exhibit Section and are considered

a reasonable likeness. The black and white composites were

prepared initially and sometime later the color composites

were prepared to epict the hijacker's complexion and age

more graphically.

concerning captioned matter.

He states he has done considerable

research in connection with an individual whom he feels is a

suspect in captioned hijacking and has a book which he has pre-

pared concerning this.

He has obtained fingerprints of this

individual and desires to furnish them to the FBI for comparison

with latent fingerprints which were located in the aircraft

following captioned hijacking.

It should be noted that there

were some latent fingerprints

as well as palm prints located in

the aircraft.

It has been explained to

will be made and he will be advised of the results. He states,

however, that on advice of his attorney, he does not desire to

agreement with him that they will not prevent him from publishing

his book. It has been explained that the FBI will in no way inter-

prepared the enclosed agreement and forwarded it

to the Seattle Office. A review of the agreement reveals the

following items which raise questions:

The first paragraph states that this agreement is

for a term of two years.

It does not appear that the time

is important inasmuch as it relates to a specific item of

In the second paragraph, it is stated that, "Within

two weeks the Bureau will send a letter to

the results of the comparison." This two week period could

poeticate difficult setting the fingeries to the

Identification Division and compared within this time.

indicated that he based this time period on information which had

previously been furnished to him by persons he had contacted

in connection with

the investigation and his purpose for including

this time period is that he desires the results as quickly as

possible.

b6

b7C

Paragraph three states in

part, "... the Bureau agrees

to place no restrictions legal or other upon

_relative

to the publication of D. B. Cooper material."

This statement

does not specifically identify the material referred to; however,

the material is the information which

has developed through

his

independent investigation and this should be more clearly spelled

out in any agreement that is signed.

Paragraph four of the agreement provides that the Bureau

will give

the opportunity to interview the subject

prior to granting interviews to other media representatives. It

has been explained tol

_that the FBI has no authority to grant or

any news media representatives.

He was advised that when

a subject is arrested, he is turned over

to the custody of the U. S. Marshal and any interviews of the

subject will then depend on the local ground rules set forth by the

U.S. Marshal as well as by the desires of the subject. He was advised

that the FBI's obligation is to insure that a person, upon arrest,

appears before the U. S. Magistrate and that following this the

subject will be in the custody of the U. S. Marshal, if in custody.

advised that he did not anticipate that the interview

with the subject would be a problem inasmuch as he and his company

would retain a lawyer for the subject if he is arrested and therefore

arrangements would be made for interview through that attorney.

THE CRIME

Un November 24, 1911, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient

Flight #305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was

en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his brief case contained a bomb

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers

aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions. After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two

airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class

section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

(Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel. It was determined the hijacker,

iwo parachutes,

Artist conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the FBI Exhibit Section and are considered

a reasonable likeness. The black and white composites were

prepared initially and sometime later the color composites

were prepared to épict the hijacker's complexion and age

Dear

Based on information which you have provided to this

and developed information concerning an individual who

"D. B. Cooper," the individual who skyjacked a

Northwest Airlines flight between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle,

•Washington, on November 24, 1971. I further understand that you

have located fingerprints of this individual. If you will make

these fingerprints available to this agency, they will be for-

warded to our Identification Division where they will be compared

with latent impressions that

were located on the skyjacked air-

craft.

In the event

the Identification Division is unable to

identify the fingerprints you submit as identical with the latent

impressions from the

aircraft, you will be advised by letter,

within five

business days of completion of the examination.

This

letter will

address.

A copy will also be sent to your attorney,

If an identification is not made it may be because

your fingerprints and the latent impressions are not from the

same individual or because the fingerprints you submit or impres-
