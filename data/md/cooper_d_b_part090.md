Re: BMV PHOTO

Pis ask to have an Agent briefly interview him and forward results to our case file, SE 164A-81, with an EC

and 302. I have attached information for the assigned SA.

We still get quite a few of these, but you never know. Key is description and his verified location in Nov

1971.

Thanks,

Dear Sir:

I believe I may have valuable tadiyatiat infornation for you to

relay to the FBI office your city about the parachuting skyjacker

who Zeft the N-O Airlines plabe in your area.

Please honor my request to remain anonymous in this letter to you

and the FBI, anything further from me would be needless as I have

all hunches on the identity of the skyjacker to gize you in this

letter, and nothing more and do not wish any typ of fetaliation

nOW Or

later:

More than one person is involved I am very certain. The actual

skyjacker himself I think, was recently employed

Jbut his facial and hair appearances were not the

sane as the drewing of the suspect

The features are the sAi sud ect oppear in the the pep de settere.

In the press reports. Doubtless, the suspect recently shortened his

hair and mustache was shaved away. The jawbone, nose, MOUTH, forehead

and ears plus overall physical description fits to this person

there last spring.

Be would be

normally and itinerant and formetly

lived in Florida. He would in the past be engaged inl

The Bureau is preparing a circular

for field-wide circularization concerning captioned case and

will include an artist's conception of the hijacker. The Bureau

has

been asked to prepare a sketch showing the unknown subject

without glasses.

Additional distribution will be made from

time to time to parachute clubs, flight instruction schools and

airports, etc., in an effort to identify the unknown subject

which undoubtedly will result in various field divisions receiving

calls on this case.

For the assistance of all offices in conducting

investigation and to evaluate

complaints from citizens, the

following information is furnished:

The unknown subject boarded captioned flight at

Portland, Oregon, using the name DAN COOPER. As the plane

was taxiing toward the runway, Stewardess!

occupied the seat reserved for the stewardesses on the right

side of the plane and behind the last row of passenger seats.

The unknown subject, who occupied the center seat in the last

row of three seats, turned and handed her an envelope

which she did not open for a few minutes until he glanced

at her several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said:

"Miss - I have a bomb here

and I would like you to sit by me."

Shortly after 3:00 p.M. Pacific Standard Time (PST)

11/24/71, a lone white male traveling from Portland, Oregon, to

Seattle, Washington, on captioned flight displayed the contents of

his brief case to a stewardess indicating to her it was a bomb

which would be exploded unless his demands were met. The hijacker

indicated his willingness to exchange the safety of the 36 passen-

gers and crew for $200,000 in cash and four parachutes. He

instructed that the plane circle the Seattle airport until his

demands were met at which time the plane landed. Once the money

and parachutes were loaded and the plane was being refueled, the

hijacker allowed the passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane leaving a flight crew of three males and one female and

the hijacker aboard. The hijacker indicated a desire to fly to

Mexico City and instructed the plane to take off flying at a low

altitude and slow speed, maintaining a southerly direction. Upon

demand the hijacker was instructed on lowering the rear passenger

door while the aircraft was in flight. He was last seen in the

aircraft by crew members at 8:05 poIl. PST, when he instructed
