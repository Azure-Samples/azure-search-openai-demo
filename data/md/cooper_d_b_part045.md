board, any officer designated to take a deposition, any officer detailed to conduct an investigation, or

WANT TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT UNDER OATH

this office is presently in possession of a Request for

Assistance from

the Legal Attache assigned to the US Embassy regarding

possible information which you might posses regarding the Hijacking of

Flight 305, on 24 November 1971. Do you infact have any information

regarding the above incident?

b6 per USCRO

A: As far as positive information, I do not know. A SSGl

State, at the same time as myself, is a master jumper and posseses the

nowledge of leaving an aireraft in the man place and returned a few

-the incident took place.

e was on leave at the time the inciden

days after the incident. I thought nothing about it, until the des-

cription of the hijacker was placed on television.

The description of

the hijacker met that ofl

to enclude the age. I approached

and in a joking manner asked him where he was on leave and what

he did with the money.

He told me that he had gone alone into Canada to

look at some land and

that he knew nothing about the incident.

Where is

at this time and is he still on active duty?

Yes, he still is on active duty.

He is now an SFC and is assigned

for duty in USAREUR Headquarters, located in Heidelberg, Germany. His

telephone numbers are Heidelberg

Military

I know

and do not think that he did it, but it was

just a

joke between him and

me since he was on leave alone at the time and met the description of th

person shown on television.

_ WANT TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT UNDER OATH:

I have been advised that I am being questioned concerning the hi-

jacking of a Northwest Orient Airlines aircraft, Flight #305 from

Portland, Or to Seattle, Washington, which occurred on 24 Nov 71.

Q: Would you relate all

assignments you have had from 1970 to the

present?

A: In 1970 I was assigned to the 3/8th Cav at Coleman Barracks in

Mannheim, Germany, until Apr 71. From May 71 until Jul 74 I was

assigned to the US Army Recruiting Station in Everett, Washington.

mastered to

I was the Station Commander.

Q: Did you take a leave in November 1971: while assigned in Everett?

A: No.

Q: Were you away from your station on Temporary Duty in Nov 71?

Q: Did you ever take a leave to Canada?

A: Yes. During the summer of 1973, I took a leave to Canada. I think

it was for 18 days. My mother and

father-in-law were visiting from

Germany, therefore I took a leave to Canada. We only stayed there

about three or four days.

Q: Are you a qualified parachutist?

A: Yes.

Q: To what degree are you a parachutist?

A: I am a novice parachutist. Military only. I have not practiced

sports parachute jumping.

am• also jumpmaster qualified. That means

I have had additional extensive training, but I am not a senior or.

master parachutist.

Q: Have you ever flown from Seattle, Washington to Portland, Oregon

or vice versa.

4: No...

Q: Earlier when you were first intormed that you were to be questioned

about the hijacking between Portland and Seattle in 71, you commented

something about "my friend D.B. COOPER"

, will you explain

A: DoB. COOPER is not my friend. I don't even know him. I made the

comment because I was in Wahst Washington when the hijacking occurred

and read the newspapers reports about it. Another Sergeant who was

assigned to the same station, had seen a sketch or a composite picture

of the hijacker in the newspaper, the one which depicted D.B. COOPER,

and told me that I looked exactly like the man portraved

in the sketch,

to include the height and weight. I don't know if

told someone

about it or not. Someone else I mean.

Q: Do you have any knowledge of the hijacking other that what was

CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT - HIJACKING:

INTERFERENCE WITH FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS

On April T, 1972, United Air Lines Flight 855,

a Boeing 727 en route from Newark, New

Jersey, to Los Angeles,

California, via Denver, Colorado, had just completed a routine

stop at Denver and was once again in flight.

Approximately 20 minutes after take off, an

unidentified man was observed to be holding a hand grenade

and a gun. He sent the grenade pin and a bullet to the pilot

with instructions that the plane be diverted to San Francisco,

California. The stewardess was the messenger, and on numerous

occasions instructions were sent from the hijacker to the pilot.

The pilot was instructed to land at the San Francisco

International Airport and to park at Runway 19-Left, along with

specific instructions as to refueling the aircraft and distance

that all vehicles should be kept from the aircraft. The

instructions also demanded $500,000 and four parachutes and

that all notes be returned to the hijacker.

After considering the safety of the passengers,

crew and airplane, United Air Lines decided to meet the hijacker's

demands. Two flight. bags were filled with cash and were delivered

to the hijacker, along with the parachutes he had demanded.

DB Cooper-18437

## Page 239

After the hijacker had determined the money and other itens

had been properly prepared, he permitted the passengers and

• part of the crew to deplane.

The pilot was then instructed to taxi to the active

runway and take off. They were to head east and climb to

14,000 feet. The cabin was to be depressurized and the pilot

was to fly to predesignated locations. The instructions from

the hijacker began to take on the appearance of flight plans

and they were delivered with increasing frequency, still using

• the stewardess as the messenger.

The hijacker covered the peephole from the cockpit

into the cabin and then began to change clothes into a jump-

suit, helmet, boots and parachute, which he did with the ease

that comes with long hours of practice. Following these

preparations, instructions were given that he be kept advised

as to ground speed, flight speeds, wind speeds, altimeter

settings and sky conditions. His last instructions were to go

to Fairfield, Utah, Price and Grand Junction, after that he

was not seen again. The pilot felt a slight surge of the

airplane in the vicinity of the Provo, Utah, Airport, and

thought the hijacker had jumped, so he sent the stewardess

into the passenger compartment to verify his departure.

pheasants fly up from under his feet, heard the brush in front

of him rustiing. He turned his flashlight on just in time to

see the back end of a skunk. " The skunk, being a good shot,

made a direct hit, putting the Agent out of commission.

-cate After an aif night search, neither the hijacker, his

parachute nor the extortion money had been located. it was

then that a telephone cali came into the Salt Lake City Office

of the FBI. The caller advised he had an acquaintance who on

several occasions had talked of the perfect plan for hijacking

an airplane. This caller advised that his friend was Richard

floyd Mc Coy, Jn., who was a Vietnam veteran, a helicopter

pilot and an avia!

"sky diver. Mc Coy was reportedly a member

of the Utah Air National Guard and a student at the Brigham

Young University, where he was studying police science.

coincidentally, the "erfect hajacking plan" discussed by Mc Coy

was almost identical to the plan implemented by the hijacker

in this instance. .:

name in an effort to locate any hand printing and handwriting

of Mg.Coy. This was done and the writing samples were forwarded

to the FBI Laboratory in Washington, D. C.

nia. At this point. it was felt an interview of Mc Coy

might prove beneficial.!

Mc Coy was located and interviewed

at the Army Operations Center at the Salt lake City Airport

and during the interview he denied any participation in or

knowledges the hijacking: He did, however, furnish the

interviewing Agents with a sample of his hand printing. The

message: "Everybody. off now except the stewardesses. They

stay. put.ceGet the hell off the GD: Be quick about it --

use this runway" was dictated to him and he printed it. This

message was sent to the FBI. Laboratory in Washington for

comparison with the message found on the airplane. Me Coy

continued to claim innocence as was released.

Meanwhile, the Laboratory in Washington had been

busy with the evidence they had already received. An expert

in handwriting had compared the note found on the airplane

with Me Coy's known writing samples which had been obtained

from military service records.

It was determined that Mc Coy

had written the note. Fingerprint experts had compared latent

prints with Me Coy's fingerprints

and it was determined that

a print on the "Mainliner Magazine" in the seat occupied by

the hijacker was made by Mc Coy.

to Los Angeles, California, at Denver, Colorado.

Approximately

15 to 20 minutes after take off, the individual was observed to

be holding a hand grenade and a gun. Ine stewardess delivered

messages of instruction to the pilot. Instructions included

diverting airplane to San Francisco, California, where UAL was

suppose to have $500,000 in cash and four parachutes available.

Instruction envelope contained one hand grenade pin and a

bullet.

Aircraft landed at San Francisco where the hijacker's

demands were met. All passengers and part of crew were permitted

to deplane.

The pilot was then ordered to take off innediately.

The pilot felt a slight surge of the airplane in the vicinity of

the Provo, Utah, Airport and thought the hijacker must have

jumped out. Information was received that a possible suspect

in the case might be Richard Floyd Mc Coy, ur. Mc Coy was

positively identified as

the hijacker through handwriting

comparisons and fingerprints located on UAl. "Mainliner Magazine"

found in seat occupied by hijacker.

Mc Coy was arrested on

April 9, 1972, alter being charged in a complaint with violation

of Section 1472(1)(1), Title 49, U. S. Code, Aircraft PIracy,

and Section 1472(j), Title 49, U. S. Code, Interfering With

Flight Attendant.

On July 10, 1972, Mc Coy appeared in U.S.

District Court and was sentenced to a period of 45 years in

the custody of the Attorney General.

McCoy, 31, a former Sunday

"McCoy opened the front

John Coneys.

"After about a split second,

he pulled his revolver,"' Coneys

said. "He got one shot off, and

the agent returned fire. It

blasted him right out the front

McCoy's single shot missed

the agent and imbedded itself in

a wall. Coneys said McCoy was

hit once by a shotgun blast.

colored, depicting the individual known as D. B. Cooper who

skyiacked Northwest Orient Flight Number 305 on November 24, 1971.

viewed the four artists' composites and stated in her

judgment, the black and white artist's composite without the

sunglasses looks just likel

John Scott

Maze, who died of a heart attack in November... 1974, in Scottsdale,

Arizona, at the age of 59.

She noted in addition to the information she furnished

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Charlottesville, Virginia,

on April 11, 1980, John Scott Maze did smoke cigarettes of the

filter type but she could not recall the brand.

She also noted he was always extremely polite, even to

her whom he did not care for at all.

She noted the composite she identified as looking just

like John Scott Maze, looked like him without the "David Niven"

type mustache he always wore.

She also recalled he alwa's talked at a low modulation as

he had

adversity towards loud noise.

She added, she talks loud

and that was one of the things Maze did not like about her.

and it she locates anything which would be of further value to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Maze, she will contact

the interviewing Agent and furnish it to him.

In conclusion she stated in her juagment, the composite

picture she identified is a picture of John Scott Maze, and Maze's

complexion was even more tan than the complexion depicted in the

colored composites when she last saw Maze in person in 1972.
