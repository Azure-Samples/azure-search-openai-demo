"Seattle Flag, Inc.," was inter-

viewed at the offices of that publication,

222 Dexter North,

Seattle, Washington, concerning an article appearing in the

"Seattle Flag", Volume 1, #5, under date of May 10, headlined,

"D.B. COOPER FOUND." Although the paper is dated May 10, it

was placed on the newsstands 5/1/72.

was advised by SA CHARLES E. FARRELL of his

right to remain silent and that anything he might say coula

be used against him in court; of the fact he had the right

to the services of an attorney and that if he did decide to

speak, he could cease to do so at any time he chose.

advised that the paper did pay $1,000 for the

story as

indicated in the newspaper, but he refused to disclose

from whom the story

was obtained.

He said the story was

furnished to him on

tapes and that the reproduction of a

$20 bill appearing in the "Seattle Flag" was made by them

from a photograph of a $20 bill which was given to them

when they purchased the story.

advised that the "Seattle Flag" normally

has a circulation of 25,000 copies, but the issue carrying

the "D.B. COOPER" story sold 28,000. They were prepared

to print another 25,000 when the story appeared in the news-

papers about the arrests of two individuals in the Bremerton

area, who perpetrated a hoax on Newsweek Magazine.

Because of

that hoax story, they did not reprint the issue and their

sales immediately dropped off.

advised he would be willing to cooperate with

the FBI in furnishing "surrounding information" (but woula

never disclose the identity of the person who sold the story)

in exchange for information as to where the discrepancies

were in the

"Seattle Flag" story.

such information would be furnished to him.

Interviewed by FBI Agents, except through his attorney ir

Long Beach. No further action is being taken concerning this

suspect.

On 9/28/72.

Dallas, Texas, furnished the following:

He said right after the NORJACK case, Aviation

Week Magazine had printed a great deal of minute detail

concerning the hijack and particularly technical data with

respect to the Boeing 727, which was the plane hijacked.

It

was obvious to him, he sald, that the hijacker had to know

a great deal about this airplane, because he knew at what

degree

to have the flaps leveled, the air speed, the time

to put the gears down, and etc.

According to

only an individual who was

highly technically qualified in this aircraft would know

this information. Therefore he suggested as a lead that

information:

He lives directly under the fly way between Portland and Seattle.

He recalls that the night of the hijacking a planewas flying very low

and slowly over his house in the early evening and about 5 minutes after

the plane flew over he heard on television that the hijacking was in

progress. He stated the plane was a jet airliner but he did not see

He pointed out that planes on the fly way always fly about

10 to 12,000 feet and in

the four years he has lived at his present

location he has never heard one so low as on the night of the hijacking.

He advised that he knows the plane was over 3,000 feet for he lives

near Mount Tus Tur and that is 3,000 feet and the plane was äbove that

mountain.

He alse pointed out that the

buried approximately two inches under the ground. He

stated he started to leave the area, but upon looking

further at the pack realized It was a parachute canopy

pack. He stated he knew this fron the fact he sas a

Paratrooper in the United States Army and before leaving

the area he decided to take custody of the pack. He

Shes lo

The following background information is being

provided to the Norfolk Division: Unsub had with him prior

to the time he jumped the following:

A. Parachute Back Pack

B. Parachute Chest Pack:

C. Briefcase or attache case

I. Dark overcoat

E. A 4x12x14 paper bag

A pair of dark slip-on shoes.

wrap around sunglasses with dark rims.

R. 10,000 $20 bills.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly con-

tained a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case

from the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous

other items he had to carry, If he did throw it prior to

jumping, it would fall almost directly in the path of the

aircraft. The 727 air stairs were lowered sometime after

pom. and Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m.

on November 24,

1971.

The plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles

during this tine.

Fort lewis, Washineton, advised on August 22, 1972, that

Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, tele-

phone L

would be able to provide expert information

concerning the

feasibility of using high resolution infrared

ox regular photographic equipment in a low flying aircraft

to locate the attache case or any other of the above-described

¿tems Unsub may have discarded prior to jumping.

The items could possibly be lodged in thickly

wooded, mountainous terrain. The search area would cover

a strip of land approximately 87 miles long by one-half

mile wide.

It has

been suggested that infrared photography

might possibly indicate non-living material, such as an

attache case, in a darker shade than living material, thereby

enabling the

case to be found using infrared high resolution

photography.

Since Unsub possibly discarded the attache case

prior to jumping, he could not have buried or hidden it.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. The

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or any

other item is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the area

covered is

relatively small when compared to the entire

flight path.

Since NORJAK is the, only aircraft hijacking in

which the subject has not been identified and apprehended

nor the ranson money recovered, the following lead is being

set forth as a method of possibly obtaining new evidence

that might identify Unsub or indicate his whereabouts:

LEAD

NORFOLK

AT LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE, VIRGINIA. WIll

expeditiously contact l

Tand determine from him

the feasibility and cost of conducting the above-described

photographic air search.

SUB. D

on November 7, 1972, EARL COSSEY was contacted at

Leota Junior High School in Woodenville, Washington, and he wa:

shown a parachute that was found near Reno, Nevada.

This chute

had been forwarded to Seattle for display to COSSEY. The chute

was a military backpack type with orange canopy and orange shroud

lines.

COSSEY stated this parachute is not identical with

the one provided UNSUB because of the following four reasons:

1. Parachute supplied subject had a white canopy.

Parachute did not have required markings around

the edge of the canopy.

3. Parachute shown to COSSEY had a clamp on it which

was not retained to parachute and was not supplied with

parachute given to UNSUB.

4. The backpack shown to COSSEY did not have a place

to attach a chestpack and the one supplied UNSUB did.

COSSEY stated that he checked his records again con-

cerning the serial number of the chutes supplied UNSUB and was

unable to locate them.

COSSEY was asked to recheck to determine

if possibly the numbers were still in his possession and he

stated he would do so.

cossey further advised he would call

the FBI if he located

the book in which the serial number of

the parachute supplied UNSUB was contained..

It was the consensus of opinion among the three

individuals above, each of whom has had considerable

experience with infrared imagery, that efforts to locate

the attache case by this means would probably prove futile.

The terrain, as described, would neutralize any effort,

particularly if tall trees and moutains are part of its

makeup.

Further explained was the necessity for the

presence of heat which would need to be generated by the

object (attache case) in contrast to the surrounding

terrain for successful infrared high resolution photography.

The size of the attache crise provides a poor target for

any type of aerial photography, including visual photograshy.

I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you for

your kind consideration in allowing the members. of my command to use

your property to establish their bivouac sito while they searched for

the missing skyjacker, "D. B. Cooper."

It was only mutual cooperation such as this that allowed the difficult

search operation to be conducted with such relative ease and efficiency.

Eefore we terminated our operation on 18 April, I directed that a

thorough clean up be made. In addition, I hope to arrange for a

regrading of access roads to the camp sites. I hope that this will

assist in repairing any damago to the land we used.

Again, thank you for your kind consideration and assistance from both

myself and the officers and men of my cormand.

Sincerely yours,
