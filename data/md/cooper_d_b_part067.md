After 29 years with the bureau,

Himmeisbach retired as of Fri-

Himmelsbach was the agent re-

when the still-unknown sky pirate

leaped from a Northwest Airlines →

parachutes on Thanksgiving Eve,

"It's been an interesting case,

VANCOUVER, Wash. - Eight-

given one by the FBI.

The boy jumped into the national

spotlight Feb. 10 when he discovered

several thousand dollars of the $200,000*

ransom paid to skyjacker Dan Cooper in

1971. The money, frayed around the

edges, was identified by FBI agents

he jumped from a

The $20 was given to the boy by.

Mike Heywood, Hough Elementary

the bill was a certificate praising the -

boy for his find.

Since finding the money, Brian and

his parents, H. Dwayne and Patricia,.

An associate professor of geology at Portland State University,

Leonard Palmer, was retained to inspect the sand and to assist in-

Earlier, Ralph Himmelsbach, a Portland FBI agent who has had

charge of following new leads in the Cooper case for a number of

"years, said he believed the money must have been deposited within

a couple of years after the skyjacking.

Dear

Ihis letter will confirm in writing a telephone conversatior

between you and Special Agent [

Jon August 6, 1980.

Furthermore, this letter is in regards to a letter from the Seattle

Division of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation to you, dated June 18,

1980, which concerned the "D. B. Cooper" hijacking case.

on July 29, 1980, the Seattle FBI Office received from you

. a set of inked fingerprints

(right and left thumb) of one Jack Scott

Farmer, Date of Birth May 22, 1944.

These fingerprints were forwarded

to the Identification Division of the FBI at Washington, D. C., and

were compared with the latent fingerprints located on the skyjacked

aircraft.

On August 6, 1980, the Identification Division telephonically

contacted the Seattle Division to advise that the comparison had been

completed and that the prints of Farmer do not match the latent

fingerprints from the aircraft.

The original fingerprints which you provided the FBI will

be returned to you by separate communication.

Your assistance in

this investigation is greatly appreciated.

When shown the compositesith glasses she observed that

it is a fairy good likeness of the UNSUB and a definite

improvement over the previous artist's conception.

She

stated that she felt the UNSUB's face should be slightly

narrower.

Regarding the hair on the new conception, she

stated that her recollection was that the UNSUB's hair

was combed more to the side much as was indicated in the

old composite

The hair should be slightly thinner than is

indicated in the new composite

The forehead should be slightly

narrower. The chin should be thinner and slightly pointed.

I stated that the mouth of the UNSUB as reflected

in the new compositedoes not appear natural. She stated

it should be more like the original conception and that the

corners of the mouth should not be turned down..

going to do this in the morning.

She said the pilot

told her to tell him that they could not take off with the

ladder down and he muttered, "Yes you can, but that's alright,

we can lower it later."

told us he thought this was significant

since this would indicate the subject knew a lot about

airplanes, perhaps that he might have worked on the 727

at one time.

Be also thought it was significant that "we'll

be flying with 15 degrees" since this is pilot talk, meanins

He said that the subject did not, that he did not give

any course, but simply said

They will be reinterviewing her tomorrow and

On November 25,

1971,

Seattle-First National Bank,

the head office being

in

Seattle, Washington, provided the

following information:

upon being advised of the iden-

tity of the writer, handed the writer a film canister contain-

ung a microfilm, upon which the serial numbers of $250,001

worth of notes were recorded.

He advised that of the $250,00

_stated that there are $230,000 worth of $20 bills

recorded on the microfilm. I

advised that in order

for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine the

serial numbers of the $20 bills which the hijacker actually

received, we must subtract serial numbers which he provided

me fron the total list of serial numbers on the microfilm.

provided a list of serial numbers

of $20 totaling $30,000 worth of notes, which, although they

were on the microfilm itself, were not part of the $200,000

worth of $20 bills which the

hijacker received.

stated that the bank packs $20 bills in packages of 100:

Each packet therefore contains $2,000 worth of $20 bills.

provided the first and last serial number in each

of these $20 bill packets and advised that we should subtract

both'of these numbers, as well as the 98

serials numbers

between each of these

groups of numbers in order to determine

the actual serial numbers of the bills which the hijacker

received.

These groups of numbers are as follows:

L41197159A thru E12561828B

L33639577A thru L20458572A

J02051511 thru I00466866

nose, wider forehead and face in general, than that depicted

He also noted, that the hijacker's hairline

was somewhat lower than the sketch and the hijacker's glasses

This would take about half an hour.

However, the aircraft

During the flight he had noticed a man seated in

of the Portland PD had been in the Lake Merwin area on 5/24/72.

ladvised that he has used [

had reported driving on the Lewis River Road and

observing a sudden bright flash at the time the hijacker is thought

according tol

This matter was resolved by their interview,

which should be in Seattle file.

However

stated that on 5/24/72 when he was at Lake

Herwin he saw buzzards circling over an inaccessible area and gave

b7C

the following directions to that location.

¾ miles from the

Speelyal Bay road on the road to Cougar, Washington (lewis River

Road) there is a 2 x 4 stake in the ground on the left side of

the road with the numeral 34 printed thereon. Opposite this stake

on the right side of the road, a short distance from the Lewis River

Road, is the ravine where the buzzards were circling. A check

with the Multnonah County coroner revealed that if the

body of the hijacker had in fact been in that area from November,

1972 due to winter conditions and other factors the remains would

still attract birds such as buzzards.

• LEAD:

At area described above conduct appropriate

money-all in $2000 bills.

(2). Each time he made a purchase - no matter'

how small-such as 2 packages of cigarettes (70¢) it

was with a $2000 bill and he never spent the change

or smaller bills. Each purchase was paid with a "new"

$2000 bill and the pattern was repeated again.

(3) He did not want to be alone and, if he

could, would get me or someone else to make his

purchases with one of his $2000 bills.

Re: D. B. Cooper

Gentlemen:

On Monday, March 13, 1972, at about 4:25

p.M. I called your office to advise that two

or three weeks ago I ran across the name

"D. B. Cooper"

in a Grays Harbor County Superior

Court case.

I am enclosing a copy of the return of

service which is on file 'in that case.

The

original signature is still in the clerk's

file and is signed in ink,

I felt probably this wouldn't be of any

benefit to you or that someone else would have

reported the circumstances, but finally con-

cluded that I should at least make it know

tọ you.

Yours very trulx,

Woman Who Predicted 4 Airplane Crashes Concealed

Psychic Power for Years Because She Feared Ridicule

By LAIN CALDER and JACK KELLEY

A California woman who predicted four plane crashes and

assassination of Bobby Kennedy, says she hid her uncanny ability for

years because she feared people would laugh at her.

Mrs. Arlene Adams,

52, a civilian administrator at Edwards Air

Force Base, told The ENQUIRER: "I first realized I had psychic powers

when I was a teen-ager, but people used to laugh at me. So I kept quiet

about it until a few years ago, when people began to believe

possible!"

Onel of the first to acknowledge Arlene's astounding talent was her

that on Jan. 2, 1966, Arlene began a

MY

suspicions are based on the following:

He resembles the sketch.

He knows a lot about planes.

He has done a lot of sky diving.

He would have the nerve to do it.

He has served time at Monroe.

He has lots of connections everywhere.

I thon concluded that an individual who is

both a sky-diver and a motorcycle enthusiast could well be

identical with the hijacker.

Ho concluded this because he

could have left his trail bike in the area where he intended

to parachute from the plane and thereby make his getaway on
