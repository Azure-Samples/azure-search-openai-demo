Deseret News staff writer

'A would-be author is convinced

that a Provo man convicted of hi-

jacking a;commercial airliner in

1972 was the legendary D.B. Coo-

per, and has filed documents in U.S.

District Court for Utah to obtain

records to prove his contention.

-Bernie D. Rhodes has filed a

Freedom of Information complaint

asking the federal court to force

the FBI to turn over documents he

believes will prove that former

Provo resident Richard Floyd Mc-

Coy Jr. is D.B. Cooper.

A federal court jury

convicted

McCoy of the April 1972 hijacking

was the man who commandeered

the airplane near Grand Junction,

Colo, claiming he had a hand gre

nade and a gun. He forced the crew

to land in San Francisco, where he

• obtained $500,000 in ransom, and

bailed out over the Provo area. He

was arrested at his home two days

later.

Judge Willis Ritter sentenced

McCoy to 45 years in prison, but

McCoy escaped in August 1974

from a federal prison in Lewis.

out with FBI agents Nov. 9, 1974, in

Virginia,

i.. Rhodes was the chief federal

probation officer in Utah at the

From the extensive conversations

McCoy is the second Utahn whose

name has surfaced this month in con-

nection with the D.B. Cooper case.

Two weeks ago, David Westmoreland,

a Utah State Prison inmate, an-

nounced he was the long-sought hi-

jacker. But Kohl said the FBI has in-

vestigated Westmoreland's story and

concluded it is a fabrication.

Rhodes said he is writing a book

about McCoy and has requested docu-

ments concerning McCoy. from the

FBI office in Salt Lake City. In Febru-

ary 1984, the FBI wrote back explain-

ing there were 44 pages of informa-

Act, which allows federal agencies to

hold back documents if their release

proceedings.

Rhodes' complaint challenges those

exemptions, claiming that McCoy's)

death and the length of time that has

passed since the hijacking makes the

FBI documents irrelevant to any cur-

rent investigation.:

deals with the hijacking should not be

DIRECTOR, FBI (164-2111)

Date 2/24/86

From :

SAC, SEATTLE (164A-81) (C)

Subject:

NORJAK;

00: SEATTLE

During the last 14½ years, Seattle Division

has conducted extensive investigation into the hijacking

of Northwest flight number 305 (NORJAK) from Portland,

Oregon to Seattle, Washington on November 24, 1971.

Initial investigation disclosed the only passenger

did not exit the aircraft in Seattle, Washington after

the hijacking was

a passenger using the name of DAN

COOPER when purchasing a ticket in Portland.

This

individual has never been positively identified or located

nor was the major portion of the $200,000.00 in Northwest

Airlines funds

ever recovered. In excess of 800 suspects

were considered and subsequently eliminated during the

course of the investigation.

During a

conference in San Francisco in April, 1976,

several West Coast Division case agents and the Bureau

supervisor at that time reviewed captioned investigation.

A memorandum from that conference reported that there were

no quality suspects at the time and only limited physical

evidence.

Eyewitness identification was considered weak

at that time.

Nearly 10 additional years have passed since

that conference.

The conference came to the conclusion

that "if COOPER was to surrender to authorities now or

in the near future, it would be extremely difficult to

make the case if he was uncooperative."

On November 24, 1976, a Federal Grand Jury in

Portland, Oregon issued a "John Doe" aka DAN COOPER, aka

D.B. COOPER indictment for one count of Air Piracy and one

count of Hobbs Act-Extortion recommending a bond of $500,000.00.

This was completed in spite of an opinion by the U.S. Attoyney's

Office, Seattle, Washington, after conferring with the

Department of Justice, that the five year Statute of limitations

The three male members of the crew remained in the cabin.

When the plane was loaded at Portland, there were

37 passengers plus the 6 members of the crew.

When the

passengers deplaned at Seattle, only 36 got off with

the subject remaining on board.

All the passengers were interviewed but only four

saw the sublectand were able to give some assistance with

descriptive data. The plane

departed SEA-TAC at 7:36PM, after

being fully gassed. At the instructions of the UNSUB, the

flaps were left down at 15 degrees and he also instructed

the landing gear remain down and at first wanted the steps

to remain down, but it was explained to him that it was

mechanically impossible to take off with the steps down.

He thereupon agreed that they could be raised for take off

but lowered once they were airborne.

The UNSUB mentioned going to Mexico City, but

because they would have to refuel, due to the extra drag caused

by the flaps down, etc., he agreed to a flight down to

Sacramento, and then over to Reno. Shortly after take off

from Seattle-Tacoma

show him how to operate the stairs and then told her to go

into the First Class Section, which she did, and to close

the curtain behind her.

then went into

the cabin

with the rest of the crew and locked the door after her.

A few minutes later they had intercom contact with the subject

but the last contact with him was at approximately 8:05 PM.

Within the next 10 minutes, the crew experienced

oscillation in

the plane and speculated that it was caused

by the subject departing the plane by way of the rear door.

investigative) of captioned case and in an effort to develop new

ideas assisting in the identification and location of subject

of captioned case, also known as Dan Cooper, D. B. Cooper.

The

feasibility of reinstituting a terrain search was discussed and

eliminated due to the ruggedness of the terrain, the dollar cost

anticipated, and the extremely large amount of manpower which

would be necessary.

The investigation to date was gone over

step by step and determined to be, by all attendees, full and

complete.

An idea

a reward offer by a source

outside of the Bureau, such as Northwest Orient Airlines, for

the location and turn-in of any one of the bills making up the

ransom package was made and believed to be our best opportunity

to create public interest in the possible solution of this

„case.

This idea is written out in depth in the detail's

of this memorandum and a recommendation to initiate this idea

is set out in the recommendation paragraph.

RECOMMENDATION: That a publicity campaign be set up in detail

for release in early Noverber, 1976, widely publicizing a reward

(exact amount yet to be determined) for any twenty dollar

turned in from the ransom list published in various media,

periodicals, and possibly local newspapers. If approved, General

This conference was set up to establish the feasibility

of obtaining a John Doe indictment and to determine the value

of redoing any basic investigation, the reviewing of investigation'

previously conducted, and to study

possible new approaches that

would result in the positive identification and. subsequent location

of the subject and/or the ransom money.

It was determined that at the present time, we had no

good suspects outstanding and the amount of hard physical evidence

was extremely limited

(tie and tie tack, straps of material from

one of the parachutes, papers from around subject's seat area,

eight cigarette butts, two hair samples and approximately 66

unidentified latent fingerprints).

To date, not one of the ransom

twenty dollar bills (10,000 in all) has been located. A

discussion ensued as to the present strenath of eyewitness

identification to which Case Agent

responded that it was

weak.

It was noted that these witnesses (10 in number)

remain very cooperative, even though it has been four and

one half years since the hijacking and several differing

composites have been made.

Concerning present status of prosecution, the attendees

felt that if Cooper was to surrender to authorities now or in

the near future, it would be extremely difficultute "make the

case" it he was uncooperative, but if he gave a signed statement

they felt they could verify whether this was in fact the true

hijacker.

The Seattle and Portland Agents in attendance felt the

accurate

story concerning the incident had never appeared in its

correct form in any publications they had read; therefore,

-2-

Memo

RE:

NORJAK

they felt they could identify positively a cooperative Cooper.

All attendees were in agreement, however, that a John Doe indictment

at this time would be difficult to obtain due to the lack of

positive identifying or even somewhat limiting data concerning

cooper, and that if someone came forth after November, 1976,

it might possibly be more harmful in the successful prosecution

of this case if the John Doe indictment was issued and then

thrown out.

and the possibility of redoing any of same. Reinterview of

A reviery as

A review was made of investigation conducted to date

witnesses at this time was considered to be unproductive as this

has been continuous upon various displays and it was felt that

at this time they were now relying on the artist's conceptions

cather than individual memory.

Discussion took place concerning

the possibility of reinstituting a terrain search of the calculated

drop area.

It was determined that this would be extremely

impractical due to several significant facts.

First, it was

stated

by the attendees that have previously participated in a search

of the area, that if Agents walked hand in hand through that area,

because of the heavy thickets, they could still walk right by

a person or a briefcase without seeing it. Next it was mentioned

that in addition, at this time, we have over four years of leaves

and brush to contend with. The expense involved, as well as man

power necessary, ruled out, as far as the attendees were concerned,

any feasibility of conducting additional terrain searches.

The next

phase discussed

was the possibility of utilizing

a reward for the missing twenty dollar bills (10,000 of them in

all).

It was felt that a nationwide campaign of

$5,000 for the first one or first five twenty dollar bills turned

over to Northwest Orient Airlines, would attract national publicity

and would serve to provide us information as to whether the

ransom money ever got into circulation. If one of these bills

was turned in, it would tell us one of two things, either Cooper

was successful in his jump and managed to escape the wooded area

with or without the assistance of an accomplice, or the money

was found by someone else and that person put it into circulation.

It was felt that Northwest Orient Airlines may desire to offer

this reward, since the claiming of this reward might enhance their

chances of securing a recovery of the $200,000 extorted from

their airlines. It was recommended that we feed the reward

offer to every type of media to afford the reward widespread

publicity. A condition to the return of the money could be an

offer of immunity from prosecution for receiving stolen property.

Memo

RE :

NORUAK

It was felt that this reward offer could be run as a nationwide

treasure hunt, thus receiving widespread publicity and therefore,

hopefully getting a major portion of the United States population

checking all twenty dollar bills coming into their possession.

We would provide lists of the serial numbers to selected coin

magazines and numismatic publications and

I ask for their assistance

in publishing portions of the list at their discretion of course.

It was also determined that timing of this publicity, if approved,

would be all important; therefore, a recommendation was made

that we initiate this publicity in November, 1976, due to the

fact that this is when this case will be receiving publicity.

The publicity, if we can judge same by past Novembers, AP and

\ UPI

releases will state that D. B. Cooper is now a free man, that

the Statute of Limitations regarding this crime has run.

Department

of Justice's stand at this time is that the Statute of Limitations

has tolled que to the fact that at the time offense was committed
