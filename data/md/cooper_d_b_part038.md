THE CRIME

On 11/24/71, a lone white male boarded Northwest

Orient flight 305 at Portland, Oregon.

At approximately 3:22

P. M., while the flight was enroute to Seattle, Washington,

he indicated to the stewardess that his brief case contained

a bomb, which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the

plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington, North-

The enclosed memorandum and its enclosures were

disseminated to personnel in the Seattle Division in order

that all Agents would be in

• a position to cover any leads

concerning this matter and, in addition, to aid them in

answering questions concerning this matter, which will surely

come up as the five-year anniversary of captioned crime draws

near.

Due to the voluminous nature of this case, a report

was not prepared in that it was determined that the

use of a

to the Agent personnel in Seattle.

It is felt this will satisfy the inspection require-

Finally, a Portland newspaper has offered a $1, 000 reward

SUBC

SUBJECT: PRESS MATTERS

For the past several years, the FBI, like many

other Governmental agencies,. has had

an "open door" policy

with all members of the news

media, with the result that

each Division now has a Special Agent who operates as that

Division's news media relations man.

It is his responsi-

bility for establishing and maintaining relations with all

news media personnel and to handle all routine inquiries.

The Bureau has instructed that whenever an inquiry is

received from a newsman, whether or not this particular

reporter has or has not written favorable or unfavorable

articles about the Bureau, he should be treated as courteously

as possible.

Naturally,

if the person is inquiring about

policy matters, the inquiry should be referred to the SAC,

or in his absence, the ASAC.

With regard to matters pertaining to pending inves-

tigations, future arrests or major cases, there appears to be

some confusion, therefore, for the purpose of clarification,

I would like to point out the following:

1.

Routine inquiries in Headquarters City should

be directed to SA

(News Media Representative

for this Division), and in his absence the SAC ox ASAC.

2.

Routine inquiries at Resident Agencies are to

be handled by the Senior Resident Agent unless it is a case

that has received some notoriety or is going to get an inor-

dinant number of inguiries, then it should be referred to

Headquarters City.

The Senior Resident Agent is the only

person authorized to talk with the press, and he should make

certain that any statement is in accordance with current

existing regulations.

3.

Whenever

a case Agent has an investigation of

any consequence or a major incident occurs, i.e. shooting,

all inquiries can be properly handled.

The case Agent should

not hesitate to notify the above, even though the incident

occurs over weekends, holidays, or after normal working hours.

4.

Case Agents are not to offer opinions, state-

ments, or speculations about cases when they are approached

by members of the press during or after investigations.

out that the D. B. COOPER case is receiving a great deal of

publicity because of the

approaching anniversary date of the

hijacking. In order that the FBI can speak in

"one" voice

about this case, it is important that all press inguiries be

referred to headquarters.

This is to avoid inconsistencies

such as

individual Agents

speculating about what might have

happened in the COOPER case and these inconsistencies being

pointed out by the members of the media.

I again want to point out that the FBI's policy with

the press has been established by the Director and has been

approved by the Attorney General. This policy is general in

nature and common sense should dictate in most instances how a

particular incident should be handled; however, the above

guidelines are being reiterated at this time.

If there is any

doubt in your mind about how to handle a particular situation,

it should be resolved in favor of immediately notifying the

SAC, ASAC, or news media representative.

FBI Siegs Up D.

Cooper Search

The statute of

limitations

is

about to expire on D.B. Cooper and

his $200,000 ransom, and the FBI is

willing to pay $5,000 to the first

person to turn in one of the $20 bills

he stole.

Cooper was the man

who

hijacked a

Northwest

Airlines

Boeing 727 flying from Portland to

Seattle on Nov. 24, 1971, by giving a

stewardess a note claiming he had

a bomb in his suitcase.

Cooper's

ransom

was

$200,000

from the airline, and he parachuted

into a raging thunderstorm from

• the jet's rear door somewhere

between Seattle and Reno, Nev.

No one is sure Cooper survived

¡the jump, and no trace of him has

•ever been found.

The FBl, aware that statute of

limitations will expire at midnight,

Nov. 24, 1976, continues the hunt.

A plan has been devised to try

and recover the 10,000 $20 bills, if

any have shown up, 'but it isn't

being well received.

The plan involves nationwide

publishing of the serial numbers of

the bills. The person who turns in

the first bill would get $5,000

reward. Smaller rewards would be

given to persons who turned in bills

later.

The FBI says, however, that

even if Cooper beats the rap, he

won't be able to go public. The IRS

believes Cooper owes back taxes

amounting to $218,000, which in-

cludes interest and penalties, for

his plunder.

Gentlemen:

A number of weeks ago I called the Indianapolis

office of the FBI and

relayed the contents of

the two inclosed news items to the lady

who took

my call. It seemed to me that an investifation

of the bills found in Newfoundland would be in

order, especially since the serial numbers of

the Cooper ransom bills are known.

The lady who listened to my story thanked me

nicely, hung up, and didnt even ask my name.

Since I was interested enough to call in the

first place,

I would certainly like to know what

happened, if anything; especially if some reward

is involved.

As a retired Federal analyst, I am very familiar

with the way many Government

agencies do not

always answer their mail, unless of course some

Congressional interest is being shown, but I will

optimistically look forward to some sort of an

answer anyway.

Yours truly

Dear Mr. Reed:

I am terribly sorry to have been so

long in replying to your letter of October 21

in regard to the Post-Intelligencer's $5,000

Unfortunately I have been out of the

We finally have concluded that the

offer of the reward will end as of December

31, 1976.

Should you have any inquiries about

the reward after the first of the year, you,

therefore, can: inform the individuals involved

that it no longer is in effect.

The following outline is the result of many hours of research

by

and we bet

live that this information will lead to the arrest and conviction

of "Dan B. Cooper", and the return of the money taken.

Dan B. Coopers "ILLUSIONS"

A. The public and the FBI believe the following:

I. On November 24, 1971 Northwest Orient flight 305 left

Washington DC for Portland Oregon, then Seattle Washington.

2. Shortly before landing in Seattle a note was given to

a stewardess to relay the following information to the pilot

a. I have a bomb in my briefcase:

b. Do the following: Relay I will exchange all 36 passengers

for $200,000 in twenty dollar bills, and 4 parachutes.

3. All the passengers, plus 2 stewardesses were released in

exchange for the above.

4. Money and chutes on board, Cooper positively identified

as being on board the aircraft - Aircraft now lifts off.

a. 8 fighter jets now tail the aircraft at slow speed, with

the door in the tail section of the aircraft open, all the way

to Reno Nevada.

1. All the fighter pilots report that no one left the aircraft

b. The aircraft now lands, FBI agents and police engulf the

aircraft and are convinced that Cooper did not get off the aircraft

in Reno Nevada.

c. Lodigicol assumption is to assume that Cooper had to

parachut off the aircraft between Seattle and Reno Nevada.

I. The search now starts for Coopers body, and the money.

a. everyone is throughly convinced that mr. Cooper is

without a doubt dead.

b. 5 years later still no evidence to indicate that Cooper

had indeed jumped. The money is still missing. Not one of the $20

dollar bills has ever turned up in circulation.

d. Cooper is now made a national hero, the public, and the FBI

are still stumped as to the whereabouts of Cooper or the money.

The following information has been abbreviated to indicate our

main findings.

A. Flight 305 starts as a routine flight from Washington DC to

Portland, then Seattle.

1. Mr. X dressed as himself now leaves DC for Seattle.

a. Mr. or Mrs. X upon arrival in Portland departs the aircraft

with the portland passengers, even though his ticket axually reads

to Seattle.

b. Mr. or MrsX now changes clothing, and now is ready to re-

board the aircraft as a ticketed passenger known as Mr. Dan Cooper.

2. Just prior to touchdown Mr. Dan Cooper hands the stewardess

a note indicating her to have the pilot to do the following:

A.I have a bomb in my briefcase have the pilot relay the following:

1. I will exchange all the passengers aboard for $200,000

and 4 parachutes.

2. The return message came that we will follow your instruc-

tions as indicated if you release the passengers first.

B. Passengers were now released as asked to do, in good faith.

DB Cooper-15153

## Page 452

= .

1. Before the passengers were released off the aircraft the following

took place as scheduled.

a. Cooper now changes back into his origional clothing of Mr. X.

1. A crewmember, most likely the Ind officer puts on the clothing

that Cooper originally had on, to complete the second part of Cooper:

2. 35 passengers, plus Mr. or Mrs. X and 2 stewardesses now de-

part the aircraft, all of these people probably state that they saw

Cooper on board the aircraft. (Actually they must have been convinced

that the 2nd officer was Cooper at this point.)

3. Actually you have 2 people playing themselves, and Cooper.

Mr. X plays himself, then Cooper until the plane lifts off, upon

which he resumes his real idenity, creating the illusion that there

are 5 people on the aircraft upon take

off, when in reality only

4 are indeed aboard.

3. Money and chutes are now put upon the aircraft, and the flight

now lifts off for Reno Nevada.

A. 8 fighter jets. now trail the aircraft all the way to Reno.

1. The aircraft flys at slow speed, and low with the door in

the tail open to create the illusion that Cooper would indeed jumpout.

•B. On the aircraît 4 crewmembers, not. 5 - because there was no Cooper-

complete the following:

1. All the evidence aboard the aircraft must be destroyed.

The dummy chutes, $200,000, and any other evidence is now

all burned. YES I SAID THAT THEY DID INDEED BURN EVERY LAST 20

DOLLAR BILL OF THE $200,000. -THE ILLUSION IS NOW COMPLETE NO COOPER,

NO MONEX, NOCHUTES, NO EVIDENCE ARRIVES IN RENO NEVADA. -

4. Upon touchdown in Reno the fighterpilots now state that Cooper

did not jump, and that nothing left that aircraft.

DB Cooper-15154

## Page 453

i

2. The FBI and police now engulf the aircraft, certain that Mr.

Cooper is aboard. Alter a through searcin of the aircraft, and crew,

they are convinced that Mr. Cooper had indeed jumped without them

detecting his jump.

THE GREATEST MADIGICAL PERFORMANCE EVER HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETED,

WITH THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AUDINCE -THE WHOLE WORLD.

1. The crew of this aircraft were nothing but actors that were

probably paid very well to put on this fine performance.

2. You must realize that the money was not the motive in this

fine madigical feat, the money was no more than a mere stage prop

that had to be burned to complete this

fine series of illusions.

3. This shows you something about our MT. Or Mrs, Cooper. Cooper

has to be a very well to do person, such as an actor, or magician..

4. In 5 years the FBI has been trying to find some evidence to

indicate that Mr. Cooper jumped, and in 5 years they have not been

able to prove this fact, no body, parachutes, or money has ever

been found.

The above information has been presented to you to be notorized

and signed|

to represent the research

that

Thave concluded, that in our opinions

may lead to the arrest and conviction of Mr. Or Mrs. Dan B. Cooper,

and accomplices. Therefore Mr. X also known as Dan B. Cooper, has his

name on the passenger list in the FBI files, and we have been denied

permission.: to look at this list by the FBI.
