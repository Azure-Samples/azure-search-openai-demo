that a white nale was seen 25 miles south of Eugene,

Oregon, at approximately 10:30 a.. on Novenber 25,

1971,

walking tron & fleld next to Interstate 5, 1s so inconclusive

as to make further Investigation unwarranted.

Since it is known UNSUB parachutes into an area

near Hoodland, Hashington, and the above-described incident

took place south of Eugene, Oregon, no further investigation

will be conducted concerning this particular aspect of the

NORJAK case.

RE: SUSPECT NORMAN KÄRL ALLEN

Chief of Police NICX GIARDINO, Bellevué, Washington,

called on November 28, 1971. He said he had a source whom

he could not disclose who said that the drawing appearing in

today's paper looked very much like NORMAN KARL ALLEN. ALLEN

allegedly left seattle about three weeks ago for Mexico city.

Source has not heard from him since.

He was formerly a

chemist at the University of Washington where his employer

died and he quit his job.

Source has no information

skill at jumping of airplanes or anything of that nature but

says that suspect looks very much like the drawing. GIARDINO

said he would question source further in regard to the possi-

bility of obtaining a photograph and Agent handling this lead

should check with GIARDINO.

, given the following set of circumstances,

the Boeing 727 which you are gencrally familiar with, the

rear stairway flying at 10,000 feet through clouds at about

178 knots on IFR Flight, what would be the conditions that

would exist as soon as the cabin was depressurized?

b6

b7c

A.

As soon as the hatch was cracked, there would

be depression matters of the aircraft.

the lowering of the

stairwell would create a

effect on the entire aircraft

because the air flow is disruptod here which would naturally

effect the aircraft.

Q. This would have no moterial effect on the jumper

physiologically at this altitude?

A. No, not at 10,000 feet.

him another three minutes to the ground.

Jumping into a heavily wooded area is also

relatively simple.

Jumping into water is even more simple for an

experienced jumper.

Q. If the wind velocity at 10,000 fcet was 25

knot's and the ground level five knots, roughly how far

could he travel?

He would be in the saddle for ten minutes.

on a clear and pull situation (immediate opening of the

chute), he could go five miles on the wind line or wind

direction; and a normal delayed opening maximum distance

with a five knot wind would be two or three thousand feet.

increases upon the increase of altitude.

Q. What would the possibility be of the jumper

shouldn't create any problem.

From the information furnished regarding the above

situation, it is my opinion that this jumper was experienced

and I would say having at least 150 jumps.

What would your guess be as to the number

of jumpers in the country that could pull this type of

jump off?

A. At least 1000 people.

In the "Parachutist" put out by the U. S. Parachute

Association, there are listed the names and state

from which

they are from for every individual which has obtained a

license, whether it is Class A, B, C, D, Or I.

A Class C jumper could have made the above jump.

There are currently 7192 licensea Class C jumpers-to say

nothing of Class D'or I.

As of this month, there are 3094 Class. D jumpers.

A.

It wouldn't bother me. I would cextainl

check it over as vould any experienced jumper.

Q. This would take less than ten minutes?

A: Yes.

!. Could an average Forest Service Smoke Jumper

pull off this job?

A. I doubt it.

Bearing in mind smoke jumpers are

for the most part all static line jumpers as is military,

and unless they're doing some skydiving on the side.

In all likelihood, the smoke jumper could be

eliminated.

I, would you discuss the age factor of a man

45 to 50 in parachute jumping?, How many are active?

A. Very few.

However, high altitude jumpers in that age

group would be extremely limited.

These would be officials

of jump clubs or parachute governing bodies and/or instructors.

l. Bringing the age factor into this, would that

change your estimate of the excess with which this jump

coula be performed?

TEASE

A. No, because of the fact it requires no spocial

physical condition to pull off a jump if you know what you're

• doing.

l. Could you estimate how many residents in

the state of washington or oregon could have pulled this

off?

A. No.

Due to the fact that the individual described above

a door, and due to the fact that the 727 was not mentloned,

It 15 unlikely that he is identical with Unsub.

Further, the man was described as follows:
