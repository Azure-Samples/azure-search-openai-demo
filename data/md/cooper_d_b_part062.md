Dear Sir,

Reference: My letter of February 24, 1972, Suuject: "D. B. Cooper."

Appatently Mr. "D. B. Couper" is still at large. Perhaps my

first letter was ignored asA"witchhunt."

Granted, my interest is

in a reward. My limited knowledge of this person all points to a

perfect "D. B. Cooper."

' have retouched a "

closely resemble my suspect.

shown below.

If you haven't made any headway in your investigation, may I

uggest that you photograph various views of this man and record hi

oice at calm and ange? moods

Then the plane passengers and crew

who are available could either identify or exoperate him.

I remember the following additional infomation about him:

He had been in the merchant marine. He was treated at the Public

Health Hopsital, located at 15th Avenue and Lake Street,

Francisco,

California for liver or kidney operation.

told him he has only a limited future.

He has a yellowi sh

complextion and usually a grim exresson.

RETOUCHED

Yours truly,
