• The plan that they finally come up with was to demand more than three

to four chutes and then take the plane into Nevada. Just as they were

coming into Reno they were to bail out.

Their plan was to tether the

chute to the back of the aircraft, hold it open and jump out when the

point was right.. In six months, then, they would split up the money.

The group was to throw a benefit over at the hospital in a big clearing

They would have jugglers and this kind of thing.

This would give the group

an excuse to be there. They would then divide the

money.

The kept changing the plan all the time to make it better. Finally,

they figured they would just fill all the seats in the back section. All

the guys wanted to get in on it as witnesses, too.

They would go along and split up their shares. I believe it was split u

would take part of the money, cash it around the country and then

he would give either the guys or the pilot the clean money six months later.

Part of the plan was that one of the guys who had a car with California

plates on it (I think it was

) would park it uptown

someplace, or along the road leading into a place where there would be a

lot of cars around.

The plan got kind of elaborate. It ended up they

would get a bunch of green stamps, a certain number, which they would fold

up. They would then use the numbers/letters on the green stamps to indicate

the license number of the car.

The plan they ended up with was simply to

take a large number of green stamps where they would be the only ones to

have that number/letter on them. One of the guys was able to do that.

He was able to get that section of green stamps.

I think it was $2,500 or $500, or something of this nature. The plan ended

where they wrote with a felt pen the license number of the car that|

through the window.

The meeting ended up that the green stamps actually

got wrapped around his windshield wiper and they got together that way.

The pilot and the stewardess. also had a part in it. She had control

of the seating. She would get on the aircraft early and also they would be

place that one of the guys knew about up along the Columbia. He was to

plant it there to be found and to throw everyone off this well laid plan.

The time now comes down to the pilot's job. He was to take the plane

and fly it over to the landing lights.

He was to come in across the first

There were several that knew aboul

the plan.

These guys paid for their own tickets and were up in the other

section, which made it even better.

The plane filled up with passengers.

The reason for taking this flight at the last minute - Thanksgiving Eve

or whenever it was - was becase this flight from Seattle to Portland

was the only time when the airline would allow a husband and wife team

to fly on the same plan.

At least one guy at the airline knew the pilot

He thought he should have a bigger share

of the money because now the FBI was notified by the guy who found the

suitcase and they had spotted all this money.

He felt that since the FBI

knew who he was, or was on his tail, he should have a bigger share of the

money to keep on the run, to keep out of their hands. It was important

that he not be caught. I think most of them went along with that idea.

Some of them had gotten their shares, but one share had not been passed.

They arranged a place to pass money and information.

I made an attempt to get in touch with the FBI in Medford in the first

land. At that time, I did not have a phone. I dropped it at that time.

Later on, however, I realized that the FBI was saying that they knew who

the person was, but they did not know his name. I instructed my secretary the

woman who was writing letters for me, to turn the information over orL

to the FBI.

She told me she took the letter and told the local FBI agent in

I tried again to get in touch with the FBI by writing them a letter.

but got none. I just threw it away finally, bater on, I find out by seeing

His life was spared because he wore a bullet proof vest.

With this information, I felt I should write him a letter and try to get in

touch with him. I wrote to him in care of the Los Angeles Police Department.

I did not hear anything.

*******

The FBI had three agents out looking for the money after this thing in

the field around these lights. I did see them spot the paracute rigging

that they had used, the strap which had been thrown over there. One of

them started to pick it up and then another said, "Leave it there. We'll

pick it up on the way back."

There were a lot of parachutes in this area,

so they just left it there and I believe they did pick it up later.

Also,

this same area, later on these guys went back to see if there was any money

there.

They were

just looking around.

Possibly this is the gangster, the money changer thate in on

and he drug it out.

It reached the floor of the cave where

went

in to pick up the money. They spotted it later on.

These other boys were

in there playing with it. The parachutes had a dye mark or some kind of

mark printing and there also was a swirl sewn over it, latest model of a

colorful parachute. Also, there is another incident in which a couple of

apparently FBI agents entered a cave in searching the area and one of them

related that this particular cave had an entrance, doorway, in it where

you could actually walk right in rather than climb. In this cave, about 10

ft. in there were a couple of real huge foot prints, several inches deep on

the floor of the cart.

One of the men related "I wonder who those belong

to?"

The other one said, "Well, if we knew who those belonged to, we'd

probably have our man."

I go back now in time to when those foot

He did describe this individual,

Certificates

A special Certificate was brought out for giving of

Appointments, expressing to a person any high degree of

gratitude, or for a special invitation.

To express our pleasure for the comfort and attentions

reccived on the Ansett ANA flight which took Prince Leonard

and Princess Shirley to South Australia for their first Royal

Visit to that State, on behalf of the Province Prince Leonard

gave Certificates to the crew and hostesses aboard.

Certificates of bestowal or investiture of peerages or

Knighthoods are also issued following the official act.

Appointments

We quote from Robert Drewe in his column "Perspective" in

The Australian of Friday, August 17, 1973:

"In a quietly impressive ceremony near Adelaide yesterday

our favourite royal family, Prince Leonard and Princess Shirley

of Hutt River Province, appointed Angle Vale Wineries official

suppliers of wines to the Royal Household.

"This is the first such honour bestowed by the Royal Family

on a company since they seceded... in 1970.

"After touring the vineyard and winery the Prince and

Princess, who are in Adelaide on a Royal visit. conferred the

honour on Pat Auld, Angle Vale's managing director."

A line of eight wines has been commissioned thus far.

Sir Richard Marshall was appointed as Consul pro tem

pending official acceptance of his credentials. Meanwhile Sir

Richard is representing the Province in South Australia. The

Provincial Flag is being flown at the Consulate where Sir

Richard is in residence.

44

Honours Bestowed

Four peerages were created in 1973 and are in accordance

with the Book of Peerage of the Hutt River Province. These

were the expression of a desire to give some recognition to

these people who not only had contributed or had qualities

worthy of high recognition, but were also extremely active in

dvising us on many subiect matters. Thus when considerin

giving such recognition the fact that an Earl is categorised a

an advisor made it quite appropriate to bestow three of these

people with Earldoms. The Earldoms created are:

"Earldom of Phoenix" was

bestowed upon Robert David

Pope on 12th April, 1973.

Mount Secession is in an area of land which is designated as

the Earldom of Phoenix. This rock outcrop predominates the

whole of the central valley of this Principality.

"Earldom of Nain" was bestowed upon Frank Burrill Pash on

12th April, 1973.

The Chapel of Nain is in an area of land designated as the

Earldom of Nain which is situated in a prominent position

looking out over the central valley. Perhaps God may have

blessed this Chapel, of which more is written elsewhere in this

booklet.

"Earldom of Astron" was bestowed upon Margaret Amelia

Isobel Sheen on 27th May, 1973.

Lake Serenity, a small lake on the higher elevations of the

Province, is in an area designated as the Earldom of Astron.

On this lake gather water birds of various species. enjoying

the serenity of their sanctuary. Al times mankind must envy

some of the serenity of nature which he himself does not

always capture.

"Baronetcy of Tucson" was bestowed upon John Steven

Whatley on 15th November, 1973. Lord Whatley is a United

States citizen and is Postmaster General of this Principality.

The Valley of Tucson, in which a lake is proposed to be

formed, constitutes the Barony.

THE HUTT RIVER

PROVINCE

Seceded from the

Australian Common-

wealth the 21st April, 1970, the sovereignty

of this independent state is by judicial law

invested with the Government in occupancy,

the Administration Board which has bestowed

the title of Prince on Leonard George

Casley, The Administrator.

The Capital of this independent sovereign

state is developing within the 29 square mite

area of the Principality of the Hutt River

Province located some 60 miles north

of

Geraldton and 28 miles northwest of North-

ampton, Western Australia.

Buildings already completed in the build

ing program which is

well under way are

The Administration Building and Hutt River.

Province Post Office, the twin Gift Shops

divided by a covered breezeway, the Rest-

aurant/ Tavern, a five-unit Motel, and the non-

denominational Chapel of Nain which was

blessed 29th August, 1973 by the Rev. F. W.

Catley, Rector of the Northampton Anglican

Church. Two christenings have been con-

ducted in the brief period since the opening

of this Chapel.

A horse riding academy is being formed!

with the aim of having a stable of 20 horses.

Construction of a swimming pool has been

completed.

There are about 30 now in residence, but

the llow of tourists reaching as many

as

2,000 in one week creates much greater

activity than this number would indicate.

Overnight accommodations are in the plan-

ning stages for early completion.

All development of the Principality, both

residential and industrial is being carried out

subject to consideration of Ecology and the

Environment first. There is an abundance of

wildflowers. Kangaroos, water birds, emus,

bustards, etc. are also here. Preservation of

these ilora and fauna is of prime importance

to the Administration Board, as well as the

residents of the Province.

The Principality has its own Coat-ol-Arms,

Hag, Postal Department with Provincial pos-

tage stamps, visas, wines commissioned for

the Royal Family bottled by Angle Vale Win-

eries of South Australia, etc.

Social Services such as Child Endowment

are provided by the Government in occu-

pancy,

services having been

quished by the Commonwealth of Australia

Social Services Department to the Govern-

ment occupancy effective from the date of

secession.

All new buildings are being designed to

have paintings and other art items as an in-

tegral part of the structures. All works on

display thus far are by Western Australian

artists. It is the desire of the Government in

• occupancy to encourage local artists. To this

end an Art College is planned for construc-

tion in the near future.

Honors Lists thus far include three Earl-

doms, One Barony, and six Knighthoods.

Others are under consideration as people

from outside the Principality give valued as-

sistance and advice, both to the Government

in occupancy and to various important ser-

vices and activities outside the Principality.

"communication because I have found it to be

very safe and efficient.

I am making three

tapes at once.

One for you. One for me and

one for my lawyer.

The reason for this tape

is to see

if I can expedite our negotiations

st what weintscussed at the ld likes a sport

At this point,

I would like to state

that I will review this tape and I may edit

part of it, parts of it, so if you find some

blank spots, you will know why. First I will

tell you what I want in this business trans-

action, then I'll explain why I think it is

reasonable. What I want is for the ATA to make

a five year 1.5 million dollar interest frea

loan to

which is a company that I am just

starting and, uh, I believe that you'a be

able

to utilize me in other parts after

I'll explain that later.

Anyhow, at

the end of five years, you can have your

1.5 million dollars back. This loan will

cover my telling you how I would do exactly

what I have told you I can and for the period

of five years, you will have the guarantee of

my son, plus my security form of work on a

way to prevent what I described from happening.

The 1.5 million will only cover this particular

problem.

I hope you would see fit to use my

security form on other problems and if so,

• they would be handled on an individual basis.

The reason I mention this, is the big mistaxe

you made in

underestimating me at the Billings

airport.

I

want you to know that I knew what

I was doing

and also I knew just how big a

fish was in

the

net. I am sure you know

that I

had you in my net.

By the way, if your

recording of our conversation didn't turn

out, I will let you listen

to mine. It came

out great. Anyhow, at that-point, I could have

taken you

down very easy and if the airlines

would pay one and a half million for a plane

load of people, what would they pay for you.

Do you get my point?

I had you 'and your men

covered before we started talking. If you

have any doubts, I'll give you a coupla things

here that might help ya.

When

we were setting

down in the chair in the lobby down there by

your ticket counter, a guy in the wine-colored shirt

that walked-in front of us while we were talking,

turned around and went back towards the restau-

rant.

That was my man. The leslow that un.

vour locals man in charge of security, and I don't

remember hisiname, the fellow that he was

watching, thelguy with the beard that was taking

all of those pictures around the airport, he

was

one of my men.

I had other men there too

covering but I'm not going to go into all that.

I'm quite sure you get the drift of it. (Pause)

I set you up for two reasons,

First,

I wanted to get your attention.

I wanted you

to give some credance to what I was sayin. I

want you to know I can do what I say I can do.

That is the second reason I want you to know

I can do what I say I can do, so if I tell you

I know how to hijack a planeload of people and

walk away with one and a half million dollars,

in untraceable, and underline untraceable, untrace-

able money, believe me I can do just that.

believe that I can, uh, sum up your and my options

here pretty easy.

Uh, let me first explain your

options...as I see them. And, if. I haven't covered

them all, I'm sure you'll let me know if you

have any others.

First one would probably be the

legal approach, uh, whatever you might try to do

along those lines uh, I talked to the Federal

people before I talked to you and I know that

uh, what I'm offering you is on legal grounds.

And if you approach me from the legal direction,

all you gonna do is get publicity on this and

I don't think you want that, and I don't see

any need in it either.

So, I think we can- eliminate

the legal approach.

The second one is un the

possibility of just ignoring me and I'll go

away, uh, I just, I don't need to explain that

one uh I think that you know that that's not

really a viable option and I'm sure you ve

already thought of that one. The third one

and I hate to have to cover this one, but that's

the way it's done nowadays, uh, is eliminate me.

NOW

that ain't gonna work either. You

know I'm

66

b7C

DB Çooper-1971Q

b7C

not so dumb but what I've protected myself,

I think you learned that.

I've got myself

protected pretty

well against that possibility

and if you should succeed, it'd be worse than

with me because uh, the way I've got

out, it'll all come out then. And the

fourth one, and I believe this is your last

option, is

to deal with me. Now we got to reach

a reasonable basis, uh, to handle this

and uh,

to uh, help reach that reasonable base, I will

explain some of my options, now.

First thing

is, I want you to know that I know the value

of what I have. I uh, might even be leaving

quite a bit of

money laying on the table on

this deal, but that's don't make any difference

to me. If

I am, I don't want to even know

about it.

I know it's worth what I'm askin'.

I know this much also.

That's it's worth a

helluva lot more on the international market.

Then if somebody should happen to try this,

they wouldn't be asking for a loan to start

a security firm.

They'd be asking for

enough money probably to set up an army. So,

uh, I'd rather not discuss this any

further

because that's, uh, an option I don't even

want to think about.

Uh, I can go to your

insurance company and I can explain to them what

I can do and I quite sure they'll believe me.

If they'll believe me, uh, I would think your

insurance rate will go up. Uh, don't want

that option either. 1 uh, would hate to think

of somebody comin' out with a how-to book or

something like this cuz un, now I'd rather

not see it happen. Um, another thing is uh,

like I told you, uh, as long as I have no

contract I have no obligations and I can sit

around and tell anybody about this and uh,

we both know what the end result of that would

there's no sense of me going into detail

there. I think that the point we've reached

right now,

is, uh, if you're a chess

player, this is what we call checkmate.

NOW,

uh,

I think the best thing

to do is, uh, Monday

I'11 go to my attorney and I'll have him draw

up a

contract on the loan and the exchange of

the information and un, as

far as the exchange

of information, we discussed this kind of and

I don't think we came up with anything there

but I'll tell you the way I see it as being

is, uh, I will verbally, myself, personally,

explain the procedure to the board of

directors of the ATA and uh, I will see that

that's, in the contract. I, uh, also, will have

in the

contract, that this explanation will only

be made after the loan is made and can't be

recalled..

Now, uh, there was another point

I wanted

to cover,l

and that was the

fact that you said to me this had been tried

before and uh, I don't think I totally explained

that aspect of it to your satifaction when we

were at the airport.

Now, let me explain some-

thing to ya here, uh, this absolutely has not

been

tried before, the way I'm talking about

doin' it, because if it had of, I, guarantee

you, you could have not suppressed this from

the news media and when I explain this to the

board of directors, I believe that you will

readily agree that what I'm saying is true.

Uh, now I want to explain to you, l

the part where I said at the beginning of

this that I might edit part of it out.

don't uh,

(inaudible) (U) motive in this and

this is not to embarrass you at all. I

think you made a big mistake at the airport

When you were sitting there talking to me.

I think you underestimated me considerably.

Uh, if you want to delete that part and this

part from this tape, then let me know that

done that, I will not bring up that

aspect at all before the board of directors.

‚I'm not out to embarrass anybody. I just

wanted you to understand I can do what I can

say I can do and there is a damm chance

I'11'

lo just exactly that. so, let's not have

any. flim flam here or

y trying to blame you

with footwork or coercion, meaning you are

scaring me, or whatever you think, I don't

intimidate. I just want to get this deal

consumated so I can go on to the test of my

life.

Now, uh, I will put the contract before

I will allow a period of time for your

staff to look over, if there's some

changes in it that you want, feel free to come

back and talk about it. If it's a change I

can live with, I'll be more than glad to.

I want this to be fair as much as possible both

ways but I'll also going

I believe that just about covers it.

A former FBI agent has renewed his

with $200,000 in cash.-

Richard: Tosaw, an attorney and. author

from California, has hired a diver to conduct

a systematic search of the Columbia River

was found on a beach in 1980;

The diver, Elden Eichler, said Thursday he

was concentrating his search on obvious

places where traces of the man who gave his

name as Dan Cooper might be found.,

But Tom Manning of Longview, who was

the local FBL agent at the time, said he thinks

Cooper drowned in Lake Merwin,

"I still feel that Cooper is in Lake Meryin,"

sald. Manning, who knows Tosaw and has

read his book about Cooper. "That's my

theory and I have no way to substantiate

that."
