This oscilla-

In order for this solution to have any credibility

(2)

There would have to have been at least seven

persons involved li.e. pilot, 2nd officer,

3rd officer, 3 stewardesses and a ticket

agent or an accomplice);

Ho passengers were involved.

Under these assumptions, this solution is not

(00: SEATTLE)

RE

Due to the fact that the individual described above

was interested only in tossing an object from a plane to an

individual on the ground, primarily via a window rather thar

a door, and due to the fact that the 727 was not mentioned,

it is unlikely that he is identical with Unsub.

Further, the man was described as follows:

Clothing:

well-dressed in brown business

suit and tie

Jewelry:

wore one or two large diamond

rings

Age:

thirty-six to forty years of age

Height:

6' or over

Build:

heavy

Weight:

possibly 200 lbs.

Complexion:

light; round, heavy face, no

distinctive features

Hair:

darl wavy hair, worn long or full

Education:

educated

Voice:

modulated voice, good speaker

and carried attache case; wrote

on yellow pad

These discrepancy differences, combined with the above

observation, indicate that no further investigation concerning

this suspect is warranted at this time.

On 11/9/73, SAC MATTSON called from Portland.

He advised that on 12/10/71 the Wilsonville, Oregon

Branch of the National Bank of Oregon was held up by

a lone robber. At the time the robber entered the bank,

a customer was being served by a teller and on the

herup and departed.

The teller advised that while waiting

for the customer to depart the robber had gone to a desk

at the side of the lobby where he did

some scribbling.

the Agent recovered from

this area a note with the name

"D. B. Cooper" printed on

it.
