Agent

If not for my inherent procrastion you might have gotten this

lotter a year or two earlier, and if not for. the urgings of many

of my friends you may not have received it at all.

You may not

be the best personicontact, but I lifted your name from the May

2och Seattle P I Sunday Norchwest magazine

section,

To shorten

what otherwise could be

a long story I wili say that it is

possible I may know the real name of the man called "Cooper."

My friends have urged me to contact the FBI and tell the same story

I have told them. They labor under the delusion I'll get rich

delusion

from all'Mewards.

But reward or not I will relate to you, or some

other agent, what I know (and do not know) if you can do what you

can to keep

my name confidential.

I have no need at all for a homocide bent, revenge crazy crook on

my trail sometime in the futures

I lost track of this man sometime in 1964, but from what little I

know of the hijacking case everything fits. The composite sketch

is not a likeness, but two of the features are certainly his.

I haven't said anything up to now

for two reasons.

1. The nagging. fear I could be causing an innocent person a

lot of trouble, and

2. should I be right the gullty party would not took to

kindly on me.

I say something now for a number of reasons.

Unlike my friends who

are positive I once knew the man who was to

become D. B. Cooper,

I am not sure. I guess I'd like to know too.

Please feel free to have an agent or yourself contact me. Maybe

you will agree with my friends.

Everytime I read something about D. B. Cooper the first Air Plane Hi jacker,

most especially when I see the composite picture of him, a name comes

to my

mind that fits that picture..

It was in the early nineteen-sixties when I first met this men. I did

not

know him very long. He said

HE

was supposed to

also

was a pilot.

I did not see him do any of these things. He had connections

in Nevada.

I do know the name of a bar he and a

partner were supposed

to

own. I remember the first name of the parüner.

I know the town where he said he rented a plane to fly to Nevada.

The reason that I haven't said anything about this before is, I called the

Bar but no one had heard of him. I made

& person

to person call.

have

always felt the name he gave me

was not his real one. I also feel kinda

foolish, but, I cannot shake this feeling that I know this man everytime I

see his

face.

He seemed to have money. Quite a lot of it.

This was a smart and intelligent man but, I did have the feeling, something

wasn't exactly kosher with him.

If you feel I may be of any help, I will gladly tell you what I know.

gincerely.
