Dear General Bolling :

With the completion of the search of the area

near Ariel, Washngton, by units of the 3rd Alr Cavalry;

I wanted to write to you personally and tell you first how

much we appreciate the services rendered. However, in doing

this I would be most remiss if we did not also tell you

that the services of your officers and men were magnificent.

The organizational structure, the equipment provided, and

most important of all the direction given to the operation

under

was most impressive.

The assistance rendered by

and

Twas in keeping with the righest '

traditions of the U. S. Army.

I could go on at greater length and identify

specifically the individual officers, as well as the non-

commissioned officers and men, but time and space do not

permit.

I do hope, however, that through your channels

you will see fit to insure that this letter of appreciation

and commendation is recorded in appropriate files

to provide credit to the splendid men who have served so well.

Sincerely yours,

of $2.57.

This invoice was charged to RICHARD F. MC COY, JR.,

tuxe of MC COY.

The invoice carried the machine date of November

25, 1972, but had the written date of Noventer 26, 1971.

The license number listed on the carbon copy of the invoice

appeared to be SA 1334 and the carbon utilized for the

"No. Caroin of these invoices had the additional notations

, however the above writing was not readily

discernible

on the written carbon copy of the invoice.

explained that the discrepancy of the

dates could be explained by virtue of the fact that his

Exom 7:00am to 3:00pm, from 3:00pm to 11:00pm and from

14:00pm to 7:00am.

He stated that in view of the fact

November 25, 1971, was a haiday, he did not personally

work that day and

as a result,

the machine date of November

25, would not have been changed to November 21, Lill, untz.

9: 0am on November 26, when he visited the station to

correlate the receipts for the holiday.

further noted that in all possibility,

the employee handling the actual transaction was on duty

been his regular work day and the machine

have been changed until his appearance later as noted above?"

Re "Seattle Flag" 5/10/72.

A review of the article concerning D.B. COOPEF

appearing in the May 10 issue of the "Seattle Flag" reveals

antual liang discrepancies between the article and the

In the article, the interviewee states he

sat in seat 15 D, whereas the hijacker actually sat in

seat 18 E.

2. The 'intervewee in the article states that he

landed over 100 miles away fron Southwest Washington. This

would be in conflict with the indications of the test flight

run by Northwest Airlines.

3. The interviewee states that he knew that with

down flaps the stalling speed of the 727 was 109 miles per

hour. This information would not appear to be known at

Northwest Airlines,

as there was some question at their office

the night of the hijacking as to whether or not the plane

could fly with 15 degree flaps.

4. In the article, the interviewee states

one of the reasons he selected a 727 was because the

lavatories in the rear were a handy place to hold a

stewardess hostage, wich turned out to be right.

In another

place the interviewee

states he held stewardess hostage part

of the tine behind the rear galley curtain and part of the

5. The interviewee in the article states that he

knows the bills were xeroxed before they were delivered to

him, as he could smell the xerox fluid on them at the tine

they were delivered.

inasnuch as the

bills were not xeroxed, and i they had been, would not

have a smell of xerox fluid.

6.

The interviewee in the article states that

the bomb which he allegedly had consisted of five Gillette

shaving cream cans painted red and rigged with prima cord

fuses.

This would disagree with the stewardesses descrip

tion of the cylinders which she observed in the briefcase,

Inasmuch as they were smaller in diameter that shaving cream

cans.

7.In the article at one place the interviewee states

concerning payment by the airline "why risk four lives - not

including mine - and a 5 million dollar airplane for a mere

$200,000?" This would appear to indicate that the person

being interviewed felt that the passengers had been released

before the money was paid, whereas the money was delivered to

the hijacker before the passengers were released.

8. In the article, the interviewee states that

he told the pilot "let the passengers off but I want every-

body in the cockpit and the other two stews to stay on the

plane." This appears to be inaccurate, inasmuch as the

hijacker did not demand that the stewardeeses remain on the

plane.

9. The interviewee in the article says that he

was in the cockpit twice, once when they were having fueling

troubles and at this time, he told the pilot "I want the

Flaps at 15 percent and the gear down m

He states that

after discussion with the filot concerning the destination

of the plane he slanned the cockpit door and went back to

the tourist compartment with the stewardess.

This is

inaccurate, inasmuch as the hijacker at no time was in the

cockpit to

the aircraft and was not observed by the flight

crew in the cockpit and instructions concerning destinations

were relayed through the stewardess.

10: The interviewee states that he selected the

name D.B. COOPER by sticking a pin in the Seattle telephone.

directory.

This is inaccurate, inasmuch as the hijacker

when purchasing his ticket, in fact used the name DAN. COOPER

instead of D. B. COOPER.

11. The interviewee in the article states the

note he gave

to the stewardess read, "I'n hijacking this

aircraft. Relay instructions to the ground that I want

$290,000 in 20s and two parachutes delivered to me when

the plane, lands. I have a bomb," Stewardess

rass i nave a bomb hear and would like you to sit by me."

He later had her take down a note which he dictated reading

"I want $200,000 by 5:00 poIl. in cash. Put it in a knapsack.

I want two back parachutes and two front parachutes.

we land I want the fuel truck ready to reful.

No funy

stuff or I'll do the job."

'12, In the article the interviewee talks about tha

parachutes, one back pack and one chest pack and states that

he did not leave any

parachute on the plane; however, cut the

chest pack into strips to use to tie the money to him.

I3. The interviewee in the article states that

after they were airborn, he took the stewardess forward

and over the intercom told SCOTt, the pilot to hold the plane

at 7,000 feet and 200 miles per hour. This is inaccurate,

inasnuch a the hijacker toldl

_to go forward

to the cabin and relayed no further instructions to the pilot.

A review of the article concerning D.B.

the following discrepancies between the article and the

2. The intervewee in the article states that he

lavatories in the rear were a handy place to hold a

stewardess hostage, wich turned out to be right..

In another

place the interviewee states he held stewardess hostage part

of the time behind the rear galley curtain and part of the

time in the toilet.

This is not true, inasmuch as the hi-

jacker did not hold the stewardess hostage in either of these

locations.

RE:

On May 1, 1972, I-called SA HENRY SCHUATZ at the

Bureau and told him that we had received information from

the news media wherein the Seattle Flag, an underground

newspaper in Seattle, had a headline article which would

be on the street on May 2, 1972, reportedly containing an

interview with the hijacker and displaying a copy of the

bill, serial number of which coincided with one of the

hijacked bills.

I told him that a very quick look at the article

showed substantial discrepancies.

In addition, we were

checking the microfilm of the hijacked bills to see if

it coincided with the bill reportedly in the newspaper

and I would let him know.

of three $20 bills, the Seattle Office marked the location

of those bills on the film with a small piece of adhesive

edge of the road near Amboy, Washington approximately one-tenth

of a mile from the Faton Road and County Road 16 junction.

He further advised that this individual did not appear as

was compared with the corresponding bill represented by K4.

In the comparison, a photographic overlay of the Q48 bill

showed the serial

number on this bill to be out of register

with the serial number on the k4 bill.

The examination definitely determined that the Q48

bill is not a part of the ransom money.

The submitted evidence is temporarily retained.

however, an extensive ground search of the area and investigation

have failed to identify or locate the hijacker.

You must now approach the investigative aspect of this

The files

RE: PARACHUTE FOUND IN SKAMANIA COUNTY

called from the Bureau.

He said that Asst. Director BATES and L

were extremely interested in our teletype about the para-

chute and wanted us to consider a further search in the

axea; consider sending material to the Laboratory and also

to show the material we found to the person we got the

chutes from.

I told

that we would certainly do whatever

is necessary to either

establish or eliminate this as the

one used in the crime, as soon

as possible.

I called

He said that 41 miles east

of Woodland on the Lewis River Road and 7 miles north of the

Lewis River Ranger Station, on an unapproved highway, is an

informal camp ground used by many hikers, hunters and

fishermen and this is where the straps were found. They

were found on 5/28/72 by a camper.

The two pieces in

possession are each

about 20" long, 1 3/4"

wide, greyish-green in color, made of webbing with some

of plastic,material on

the back.

Each piece had been

burnedlonteach end.

One of the pieces has'the number 12345

on the back. They were found in the remains of an old fire,

partially concealed through the natural accumulation of dirt,

pine needles, etc.

They were actually found by a woman

scrapping around in the ground trying to find a place for a

sleeping bag.

The third piece which

does not yet

have, but which he will get this

morning,

allegedly has

a

name on the back -- EISNER Company, 1/52, and number 5010857.

I requested

to get that piece as soon

as possible; to bring

them all to Seattle; take them out

and show them to COSEY, the man who oth

the Ribachute.

He said he should be here in Seattle

afternoon.

On 4/19/72 SAC CALAME called from Salt Lake City.

He advised that they had been unable to establish

the whercabouts of RICHARD FLOYD MCCOY on 11/24/71, the day

of the hijacking. They have noted that gas purchases were

made with his credit card at Provo, Utah; Cedar City, Utah

-and at Las Vegas, Nevada, for his automobilo on 11/25/71,

the last one being nade at las Vegas, Nevada, some time

between 21:00 PM On 11/25/71, and 9:00 AM On 11/26/71.

Further, McCOY and his wife are inveterate users of crodit

cards, purchasing meals and other small itens on credit

cards, but they have been unable to locate any purchases

on the credit cards for 11/24/71.

A long distance telephone call was nade from a public

phone in the Tropicana Motel at Las Vegas to McCOY's hoc in

Provo collect on 11/25/71. .

I suggested to then that they

have Las Vegas find out who made the call since the Telephone

Company maintaing records on the identity of the caller.

They advised that

when shown

the photograph of the necktie and tie clip found in tho

Northwest Airlines plane related that he had seen MeCOY

wear similar ties.

In addition, ho said the tie clasp

looks familiar but he cannot say for sure if McCOY had

one exactly like it.

During the conversation SAC CAME suggested, and

I agree, that we should check with the Army at Fort Lewis

and at McChord AFB to seo if MeCOY could have made any

flights on a military plane arriving at MoChord or Fort Lewis

on November 22, 23 or 24, 1971, or made any flight fros there

on those dates or November 25 or, 26, 1971.

In addition, steps should be initiated at once

through the appropriate airline to determine if McCOy using

the nave R. McCOY, RICHARD FLOYD MCCOY, D. COOPER, DAN COOPER OF

J. JOHNSON, wade any flights fron cither Seattle or Portland to

San Prancisco, Los Angeles, or Las Vegas subscount to 8:15 Ill

This should be done at once.

SUBJECT: NORJAX

Re Bureau airtel 5/17/72.

Pursuant to instructions contained in referenced

airtel, an extensive file review of captioned case was con-

ducted.

Among the files reviewed were the main volumes,

numbered 1 through 47, sub-files designated for particular

areas of interest, 1.e., Parachutes, Witnesses, Course, 1-A

volumes and numerous suspect files. In addition, an examina-

tion was

made of all physical evidence being maintained at

Seattle, for pertinent investigative leads.

As a result of this review, the following suggestions

are being proposed:

REWARD: This case has generated world-wide attention and

to be received. However, since nothing of value has yet been

developed, it is felt that the prospect of a substantial

reward for information leading to the identification and

conviction of this hijacker, might entice someone to come

forward and name the hijacker.

To be realistic, the reward would have to be

attractive to the person furnishing the information and

therefore, a sum of not less than $25,000 is recommended.

The reward money could be provided either by the

Department of Justice, or by the airlines, or by both.

only reward at the moment is $5,000, offered by the Seattle,

Washington newspaper SEATTLI, POST INTEILIGENCER "Secret

Witness Program."

SAFE DEPOSIE BOXES: Since nothing was found in the search

conducted by the Army in March and

April, 1972 of the probable drop area in southwestern

Washington, it now appears quite possible that the hijacker

escaped safely and might have secreted the money in a

safe deposit box.

It Is recommended that nation-wide circularization

bo made of all banks, savings and loan associations and

commerical companies offering this type security.

such location would be furnished with a description of the

subject and the artist's conception showing the hijacker

with and without the glasses.

THE BOFING COMPANY: In 1963-1964, The Boeing Company had

a team of 20

to 30 engineers and test

pilots experimenting with the air stales of The Boeing 727

to determine the plane's adaptability for dropping cargo

or personnel. In the tests conducted the air stairs were

removed and packages were dropped fron the plane usino an

especially destoned chute.

b7E

The Boeing Company has furnished the names of their

employees who were involved in that experiment and investi-

gation is being conducted to determine if one of these could be

the hijacker. They are also being interviewed fox any info they

may have as to the identity of the hijacker.

Seattle Is continuing to screen suspects in this

matter, which are received from various sources and will

give expedite attention to any worthwhile information

obtained.

Personally, I'm getting too old to care very much

what happens any more - I can't afford a plane trip

Dear Mr. Milnes,

Now that the Army's participation in the search for D. B. Cooper

has been completed, I would like to express to you my appreciation

for the outstanding assistance and cooperation which you and your

agents gave to

_and his squadron, It would have been

understandable had the Bureau confined its participation only to

those aspects of the search which required the presence of its

agents,

To the contrary, your agents participated to the fullest

extent, and the manner in

which they did so was most impressive.

Their willingness to

share the hardships of field duty and their

cheerful cooperation in the

search efforts reilects most favorably

on their professionalism and on your leadership.

On behalf of all Army members of the search force, I express my

sincere appreciation to you and all agents who took part in the

operation.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: NORJAK

Mount Vernon, washington, Mr. CoRtEREr

1401 S. 12th,

contacted by

the writer in

response to a phone call he made to the Everett Resident

Agency concerning captioned matter.

Mr. WEINZ indicated

that he worked for the Skagit County Sheriff's Office as a

deputy for five years about 20 years ago, and would have

come forward with information sooner if he had not developed

such a distrust for the American Court System.

He recently

saw an article in the Seattle Times, which indicated that the

Air Transport Association of America would pay up to $250,000

for information leading to the arrest and conviction of

persons connitting airborne crimes.

Mr. WEINZ indicated

that he is a businessman and felt that he could furnish some

information concerning

this hijacking, if the reward was

high enough.

Mr. WEINZ indicated that an individual he has known

for several years, came to his home in Mount Vernon several

weeks before the

hijacking,

He indicated that he and friends

were going to pull a big deal with a take of $200,000. He

said it would be the greatest news event in the northwest and

would make

all of the papers.

His partner remained outside in

the car while WEINZ spoke with his friend. Mr. WEINZ said he

would furnish no other information until he was told how much

reward he would get.

On May 10, 1972, SA CHARLES E. FARRELL was contacted

by the writer regarding the above information. He indicated

that the reward for information leading to the arrest and

conviction of the subject is $5,000.

On May 11, 1972, Mo. VERNER WEINZ was again contacted

at his home in Mount Vernon by the writer.

He immediately

inquired as

to the amount of the reward and was given a figure

of $5,000. Mr. WEINZ laughed and said he would furnish the

information for no less athan $50,000 and would have to have

a majority of that amount in his possession before he would

furnish any names.

WEINZ did agree to furnish additional

details concerning tis conversation with the frienat-81-3 4LC

He advised tat in November 1971, approximately 3

weeks before the hijacking, his friend stopped by the

house.

The friend

indicated that a big deal had been

set

He said there were

deal, and they needed

replacement.

The friend indicated the

group would make $200,000 and that this would be the biggest

deal ever pulled in the northwest. As he left, he said, "You

will read about this in all of the papers."

and never mentioned airplanes

home approximately 1 1/2 hours, but said nothing specific about

the type of job he had planned. On a previous contact the

friend asked WEINZ if he would ever consider a job outside the

I aw.

WEINZ told thim that he needed work and would consider

anything.

WEINZ further stated that there was a second man

for his friend in the car.

He did not get a good l00k

of the hijacker.

Mr. WEINZ againstated that he would furnish no

other information and would furnish no names, unless he is

Insured of at least $50,000.

He said that the more he thinks

it over, the more he thinks the information is worth at least

$100,000.

WEINZ is a white male, American, born May 24, 1911,

6'2", 210 pounds, gray hair, blue eyes.

On May 11, 1972, this, matter was discussed with

Sheriff JOHN BOXINGION,

Skagit County Sheriff's Offce,

Vernon, Washington. BOYINGTON advised that he has

known weINz for many years and served with the sheriff's

office at the same time as WEINZ. He indicated that WEINZ was

in the pinball machine business for several years before the

state clamped down on the business. He has

many contacts out-

side the law and has the ability to obtain information about

crimes.

In most instances, his information is fairly accurate.

BOYINGTON stated that WEINZ is in desperate need of money and

would furnish information if even a small amount were offered

to him.

He also stated that WEINZ drinks too much at times and

tends to become loud and boasts.

He can be a very dangerous

man at most times and is very strong.

No further investigation being conducted, unless

requested by case agent.
