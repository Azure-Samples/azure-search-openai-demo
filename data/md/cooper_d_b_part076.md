(ATTN: LATENT FINGERPRINT SECTION)

FROM : SAC, SEATTLE (164-81) (P)

SUBJECT: NORJAK (A).

00: SEATTLE

For the information of the Latent Fingerprint

Section, approximately 80 partial latent prints were obtained

from the aircraft in which captioned hijacking took place.

To date, Seattle is not aware that these partials have been

searched through the computer system.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU

If deemed appropriate, the Latent Fingerprint

Section will:

1. Review all latents in this case for the

purpose of

searching them through the computer system

for possible identification.

2. Will also forward to Seattle a copy of each

full impression or any classifiable impression.

These

impressions would be used by Seattle to search them through

local files in the State of Washington.

MEDIA MATTERS

ReButel to all Picla Divisions dated 5/5/78,

captioned,

"NORJAK."

Referenced airtel instructs that any additional

press inquiries concerning this 6 1/2 year old investigation

be referred to the Seattic Division for handling and sets

forth the text of what Seattle considers the only infornation

that should be released to the press.

Portland concurs in the theory that all media

inquiries be handled by one Burcau spokesman in any investiga-

tion which has national or regional interest. Certainly

NORJAK falls within this area and Seattle,. as office of

origin, should indeed respond to all media inquiries to the

extent deemed appropriate by Seattle and the Bureau.

• Portland feels, however, that its media credibility

will not be enhanced with this posture in this case at this

point in time. As the Bureau and Seattle are aware, Portland,

at Bureau Instructions, has been responding since ORJAK began

to the national media inquirion, including cooperation in

a 30-minute IV documentary. Further, Portland case Agent,

again at Bureau request, responded to a background type

• interview by

MIKE

WALLACE for

"G0 Minutes," CBS, New York, on 5/4/78, just prior

to the issuance of retel.

For the Portland Division at this point in time to

take a non-cooperative posture with the media can only diminish

the credibility of this Division's media relations, not to

mention the overall Bureau credibility with the media. I

am confident that the information released prior to my arrival

in the Portland Division and am equally certain that the

information released subsequent to my arrival in the Portland

Division has in no way invaded the privacy of witnesses or

• otherwise had any adverse affect on the prosecutive potential

of this case.

to the

contrary, it has been the notoriety

generated by Portland's cooperation with the media that has

maintained a steady flow of information coming from the general

public.

It can be readily understood that the failure to solve

this case is not the type of publicity which any individual

office of the Bureau as a whole would be soliciting. With the

lack of positive investigative leads, the cooperation of the

public is for all practical purposes the only source of informa-

tion which may lead

to the solution of the case.

The text of

the release suggested by Seattle certainly does not give the

public (our source of leads in this matter) a full profile of

"D. B. CUOPER."

It is Portland's recommendation that the Bureau adopt

the general policy of one Burcau spokesman in any investigation

which has national or regional interest and that the information

to be released be coordinated by the SiC of that office and the

PubliC Affairs Office at FBIHQ, and that this practice and

procedure be established at the outset of the investigation to

preclude the very rcasons that are articulated by Seattle in

retel. Obviously, it then becomes the responsibility of the

spokesman office to meet the entire media responsibilities

for the Bureau as a whole for the life of the investigation.

ReButelcal to Seattle 3/30/77.

Enclosed for Seattle are Xerox copies of missing

person index cards which generally fit the description of

captioned unsub.

In connection with captioned investigation it was

suggested by the Criminal Investigative Division that a

manual search of the missing persons indices be conducted

here at FBIHQ Identification Division. Approximately 5200

cards fontaining information regarding missing persons

were reviewed in an effort to identify logical suspects who

were reported as missing at about the time the hijacking

occurred. Identification Division personnel were furnished

with a composite description of Dan Cooper and as a result

the below listed white males were developed as suspects.

Each of the individuals were reported as missing during latter

1971 or 1972.

This search was based upon the presumption that

unsub may have perished during the jump from the aircraft

and that some relative somewhere may have filed a missing

person report.

maining and thoroughly process him as a suspect in this matter.

Finally

explained that he could eliminate half

of the missing persons because they were female and a great

portion of the remaining because of age differences between

differences

them and UNSUB in this matter. In addition to age differences,

there were others eliminated because. of race:

Dear Mr. Reed:

I am terribly sorry to have been so

long in replying to your letter of October 21

in regard to the Post-Intelligencer's $5,000

reward for the arrest and conviction of D. B.

Cooper. Unfortunately I have been out of the

problem of the reward.

We finally have concluded that the

offer of the reward will end as of December

31, 1976. Should you have any inquiries about

the reward after the first of the year, you,

therefore,

can inform the individuals involved

that it no longer is in effect.

Enclosed for the Bureau are one copy of a Seattle

memorandum of SAI

with enclosures.

The enclosed memorandum and its enclosures were

disseminated to personnel in the Seattle Division in order

that all Agents would be in a position to cover any leads

• concerning this matter and, in addition, to aid them in

answering questions concerning this matter, which will surely

come up as the five-year anniversary of captioned crime draws

near.

Due to the voluminous nature of this case, a report

was not prepared in that it was determined that the

use of a

memorandum would facilitate getting the appropriate information

to the Agent personnel in Seattle.

It is felt this will satisfy the inspection require-

ment requesting a summary report for internal use be prepared

during the Seattle inspection of May 10 through 24, 1976..

Leads concerning suspects will not be set forth

in this report as they are being handled by separate com-

munication.

There are currently 637 suspects, 470 of hon have

been eliminated.

Ner suspects are being developed and

systematic

climination of these suspects continues.

In an effort to facilitate interoffice communi-

cations, it is requested that all ficla offices originating

NORJAK communications, not only refer to the appropriate

communications but also include the suspect(s) name and

alias(es) if known on the first page under the title NORJAK.

for the information of all field offices, the

Bureau advised by airtel september 15, 1972, that

this is

the only aircraft hijacking in which the subject has not

been identified and

appreheuded nor the ransom money

recovered. All leads in this important case are to be

set forth expeditiously. The investigation of

this case

is to be

vigorously pursued in all facets in order to bring

it to a successiul completion.

It is noted that the investigative poriod overlaps

previous NORJAK reports.

This has been done since previous

reports vere not distributed to all field offices.

It is nöted that Unsub

• in this matter is almost

universally called "D. B. COOPER" by the press, the public,

and even

by Bureau personnel.

Factually, there is no basis

for this alias.

As a possible explanation for the existence

of the alins "D. B. COOPER" the following sequence of

events is offered:

While the hijacking was in progress on the evening

of Novenber 24, 1971, it was established that a

had boarded the flight at Portland, but was not among the

passengers who deplaned at Seattle.

As a result, the name

in the initial evaluation of new leads.

INVESTIGALIVE STEPS TO PROCESS NORJAK SUSPECTS

This list in no way represents all the means avail-

Each individual case prompts a

different method; one or more of the below listed methods

have

been used in the past.

1. Obtain current' descriptive data (particularly

useful is age, height and complexion)

2. Ascertain location on November 24, 1971, by

(a) checking employment records.

(b) checking cancelled checks or credit card.

PROFILE

The purpose of the following information is to

conveniently list all the known facts concerning the hi-

jacker's profile and to combine them with suppositions that

can be reasonably inferred from those facts.

The suppositions

have been included to aid in processing a suspect.

They

should not be considered as concrete facts, nor should they

se used as the sole determinine facton in drawing investi-

gative conclusions.

SUMMARY

Unsub was a well spoken, conservative gentlemen;

probably a Catholic wich mexican

or Indian blood. He was

not an alcoholic. He probably lived in the Portland or

Seattle areas or had flown more than once over these areas.

He apparently had no accomplices.

He was not an experienced

skydiver and most probably received his jump training in

the military.

his hijacking plan was not well thought out,

and he was probably not an experienced criminal. He was

apparently having financial troubles prior to November,

1971, and he may have previously worked in an airline-

related indus try.

The reasons for the above suppositions are in-

cluded below.

BACKGROUND

• It is felt Unsub was not. an experienced criminal

because of his mannerism exhibited after he received the

ransom noney. Unsub reportedly became somewhat childish

in his actions and comments while counting the money.

Unsub was faniliar with the Seattle area, as

indicated by his comments concerning the plane's location

as it flew over Tacoma, Washington.

In addition, Unsub

made

a comment as to the distance McChord Air Force Base •

was in relation to Sea-Tac Airport.

Unsub reportedly

indicated MeChord was approximately 20 ninutes from

Sea-Tac, which is essentially correct.

COVER PAGE

DB Cooper-33034 •

## Page 66

SE 164-81

Unsub stated he was hijacking the aircraft

because of a grudge. He may huve had a relative, possilly

a son, killed in Vietnan or he nay have had recent finan-

cial problems which would foster such a prudre.

Unsub's complexion has been described as swarthy

or dark.

The prudge may be associated with his background

which could possibly be Indian, Mexican or possibly

Italian descent.

Note unsub has been described hy witness

as definitely having, some Mexican or Indian

"blood" in him.

It is noted the northwest area at the time of the

hijacking was sufferin from a depressed

economic condition,

and since Unsub was faniliar with the Seattle area as in-

dicated above,

it is possible Unsub was out of work at the

time of NORJAK.

In addition, Unsub demonstrated considerable

knowledge

of aircraft and of

flying, and it is felt he was

employed in the aircraft industry, either civilian or

military ai one time in his life, therefore, it is logical

to assume unsub may possibly have been out of work in an

airlines-related industry.

His actions and reactions that occurred throughout

the hijacking indicate unsub probably was not a desperate

man, nor was he mentally ill such as a paranoid type. Unsub

exhibited

i an unusually calm manner throughout the whole

hijacking.

Unsub was probably a "Ioner" and carried out the

hijacking by himself, with no partners.

Throughout the

hijacking, he exhibited a competency in reacting to various

situations that arose.

It is believed that Unsub was not

an experienced crininal, but a victim of circumstances.

Unsub's physical build and his handiness with the

parachute shroud lines indicates coordination and some

physical ability as will as inventiveness. (It is noted

that during the hijacking unsub requested a knapsack to put

the money in and he received a small white bar instead.

Unsub took a small pocket knife from his person and

fashioned a means to attach the small bas to his body using,

parachute lines from an unused parachute. Since it is

SE 164-81

believed unsub was not well prepared for the hijacking and

had not thoroughly thought the hijacking out, he most pro-

bably always carries a small pocket knife with him.

The following information tends to indicate unsub

was somewhat conservative in his thinking and dress:

1. Short style hair

2. Age mid 40's

3. Dark colored suit, dark colored raincoat,

white shirt, narrow black tie.

4.

Unsub did not swear and showed a great deal

of respect for the stewardesses on the

airline because they were women. (Unsub

engaged in a small argument with one of the

passengers, as well

as experiencing extremely

tense and nervous

situations, and through it

all he never used

profane language - this

might indicate he is possibly a religious

man •

Since he did drink, and since he is

possibly religious, he probably is not a

Baptist or Mormon.)

The following information tends to indicate Unsub

possibily possessed athletic ability:

1. His physical build was described as average

to well built, even though his age was

described as in his mid-40's.

2. Unsub exhibited sone physical dexterity using

his hands and a small knife.

3. Unsub apparently parachuted from an aircräft

at night; something that would require no

small degree of physical ability.

It is felt unsub possibly maintains his physical

well being through regular exercise.

Unsub was a a following information tends to indicate the

NORJAK flight after he received his ransom

money. He did not offer them ransom money

as the tip, but used his own money.

2. During, the entire hijacking he did not use

profane language.

3. Throughout the hijacking he maintained a calm

demeanor and spoke low and intelligently:

The following information tends to indicate

Unsub lived in the northwest area at some time in his life:

1. Unsub knew the distance from MoChord to

Sea-Tac and. recognized Tacona, Washington from

the air.

2.

Unsub was dressed in a suit and lightweight

overcoat which is comnonly worn by many north-

west area residents.

3.

No accent of unusual speech mannerisms were

detected by the Northwest Airlines stewardesses

who had a chance to observe him.

SPORT PARACHUTIST

• The hijacker is probably not a sports parachutist

• nor Is he a memuer of a sport parachute club. The reasons

for this are as follows:

1. The hijacker requested two back parachutes

and two front parachutes.

He gave no specific

instructions as to the type of parachute that

he desired.

(i.c. a sports parachutist would

probably have requested a steerable sport

SE 164-82

2. Several sport parachutists have advised that

a sport pürachutist possesses an emotional

attachnent to his parachute and probably would

not jump from an aircraft with anyone else's

chute, nor would they jump with a chute they

had not packed themselves.

The hijacker was furnished a parachute that

opens quickly, has a high rate of descent, and one that was

not steerable.

3. The hijacker was furnished two front parachutes,

comnonly called chest nacks which are to bu usec

in an

emergency when the back pack parachute

or main parachute fails to open properly.

The

chest pack parachute

the hijacker took with him

was a dummy parachute.

It was designed for lectures to demon-

strate to new parachutists the proper nethod of opening a

chest pack parachute. It is felt an experienced sports para-

chutist would probably have noticed this defect.

4. Unsub's age has been described as mid 40's

and it is noted that the average age in nost

sport parachute clubs is mid 20's. If Unsub

was a member of a sport parachute club he would

certainly be an unusual member, one thai would

be easily recognized by the other members, as well as one that

was well known because of his unusual age.

to the large amount of publicity añorded this case, someone

in a sport parachute club would have recognized his fellow

as being identical with Unsub if in fact Unsub

was a member of any sports parachute club.

When the stewardess presented the parachutes

to the hijacker she also presented an instruction sheet on

now to utilize a parachute.

At that time, Unsub stated he

did not need any instructions concerning the use of a

parachute.

Since Unsub did not specify a specific type of

chute and because of the above reasoning, concerning Unsub's

age, it is felt Unsub was

not an experienced jumper or even

a sport jumper.

In addition; Unsub probably had some jump

training most probably obtained while in the military.

.

HABITS

Unsub drinks in moderation and is probably not an

alcoholic.

Unsib ordered one bourbon and seven at the be-

ginning of the flight and although he was offored several

free drinks later, he turned them down.

This would indicate

that Unsub possessed

sufficient willpower to refuse alconol

in a tension-filled situation.

It is believed an alcohclic

or a former alcoholic who had just had one drink and was

placed in a situation of similar stress. would succumb to the

pressure and imbibe in the free drinks offered him by the

stewardesses.

Located in the ashtray utilized by Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter cigarettes,

and

the eighth cigarette is possibly the same.

These cigar-

eites are sold in a "soft pack". Unsub was in the aircraft

eight hours in an extremely tense situation. During the

eight hours,

A two-pack-a-day

snoker would have consumed 20 cigarattes in eight hours

under normal circunstances.

It is felt Unsub may possibly

smoke.less than one pack a day.

CLOTHES

Located in Seat 18'E (the seat Unsub occupied)

was a black clip-on tie which contained

a tie clip des-

cribed

as yellow gold in color, with a white pearl circular

stone in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name

"Towncraft" and hore the legend "Store 3, Penneys".

Investigation at Las Vegas indicated this type tie

was sold for abour $1.50 and that this particular tie was .

about a year to a ayear and a half old.

It was a favorite

item for individuals such as

waiters, busboys and

barten-

ders.

Stewardess lUCKLOw has said that this tie, found

on the aircraft, was probably Unsubs and other witnesses have

indicated he vore a similar type tie.

SE 264-81

Since Unsub wore a tie during the hijackinr, and

for other reasons described above, it is felt he was possibly

an executive. However, since the

tie was narrow and a

clip-on type not currently in style, Unsub was possibly

not on a top-level executive.

Unsub carried with him a cheap briefcase that

appeared to be new. It is thought the hijacker probably

purchased this briefcase just prior to the hijacking to be

used during the hijücking only.

Unsub wore a white shirt with small collar points

indicating he probably did not have the money to obtain a

more fashionable wardrobe

(i.e, more colorful shirts with

larger collars currently in style). The white shirt could

also indicate the hijacker's conservative taste in

nant ins

clothing.

EDUCATION

Unsub was accessed to be a high school graduate

possibly with some college training, based primarily on

vocabulary used during the hijack.

Further, Unsub impressec

stewardesses as possibly being expurienced in dealing with

people.

They, thererore, concluded he was the executive

type and seemed to naturally dictate the ransoned demands

to the stewardesses in lieu of writing the notes out himsolf.

Synopsis:

On Novenher 24, 1971, a white male skyjacked a Horth-

west Airlines Flight from Portland to Seattle. The

hijacker

demanded ind received $200,000 and four para-

chutes upon Janding at Seattle-Pacona International

Airport.

After receiving the ransom noney, the hijacker

allowed

the passengers to leave. The plane then took

off for Reno and at 8:11 p.n. a pressurc oscillation

was

noted hy the plane's cret.

That pressure oscillation

was probably caused by the hijacker leaving the airraft.

Search of the aircraft at Reno revealed the hijacker

was not in the plane when it landed. Extensive

searches

of the aren into which the hijacker would have landed

failed to locate the hijacker or any evidence of volue.

The initial black and white artist composite dravin"

of the hijacker was changed to a color sketch to more

accurately reflect the hijacker's age and swarthy

complexion.

The Unsub, aka

at 2:00 PM, Pacific

Standard Tine, November 24, 1971, purchased a one-way coach

ticket at the

Portland International Airport, Portland,

Oregon, for travel from Portland to Seattle, Washington,

on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight Number 305, which was

a Boeing 727 aircraft.. Unsub paid for this flight with a

twenty dollar bill and had no luggage. He occupied seat

number 18 E on the aircraft.

The Boeing 727 has three seats on each side of

the aisle.

Row l8 is the last one on both the right and

left side of the aisle. The seats are identified from left

to right as you face the front of the aircraft with A,B,C

'on the left side of the aisle and D (aisle seat), I (center seat)

and F (window seat) on the right side.

Almost flush against the back of row 18, except

for some eight inches near the

aisle, is a bulkhead which

forms the wall for the lavatories, located behind row 18;

one on the right and one on the left.

Beyond the lavatory

doors is the door leading to the air stairs:

The door to the air stairs is always closed and

locked, except when loäding or unloading passengers. It is

located straight away at the end of the aisle beyond row 18

and is perhaps some 3k feet from the last, row and is in

easy reach for someone sitting in' row 18.

Built into the lower portion of the door to the

air stairs is the stewardess seat which is pulled down when

in use, so that a person sitting in that seat looks straight

down the aisle toward the front of the aircraft. On take-off

this seat was occupied by Stewardess

Prior to the time the aircraft taxied on the run-

way; he purchased a boumbon and Seven Up from Stewardess

As the aircraft taxied toward the runway for

takeoff, Unsub turned and handed Stewardess [

envelope containing a note written in black felt-tip pen on

plain white unlined paper which said:

"Miss, I have a bomb here and I would like you to

sit by me"

The hijacker then dictated the following:

"I want $200,000 by 5:00.p.M. in cash", (No

specification as to denomination, age or sequence of bills).

"Put it in a knapsack. I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes" (no other specification concerning para-

chute types).

"When we land I want a fuel truck ready

to refuel" (probably his flying experience caused him to

add this). "No funny stuff or I'll do the job" (the first

attempted parachute skyjacking had been foiled about 12

days earlier by the hijacked aircraft's crew.)

The hijacker showed both Stewardesses the contents

of his briefcase and stated it was an electrical device and

requested the aircraft radio be used as little as possilic.

The hijacker explained why he hijacked this plane

by stating

"it's not because I have a grudge against the

airlines, it's because I have a grudge."

The hijacker then added that the flight suited

his time, place and plans (probably the convenience of a

Portland to Seattle flight suited the hijacker).

The hijacker very carefully demanded that each and

every note either witten by him or dictated to the stewardess

by him be returned to hin and he also had a used match cover

which was used to convey notes returned to him.

Stewardess

showed Stewardess

gonna one of a here to pro pure the

notes concerning the hijacking.

The aircraft landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 PM, PST, at

which time $200,000, in twenty dollar bills, weighing 19 pounds,

two back chutes

and two chest chutes were given to him in a

white canvas bag.

as were Stewardess

The passengers then were allowed to deplane

and another stewardess.

The hijacker went to the lavatory just behind row

18 (the row he which he was sitting) und as he exited the

lavatory he was seen

carrying the briefcase on its side in

both arms, with a 12"x16"xl" light-colored package on top

of the briefcase.

Stewardess

Ithen acted as a conmunica-

tions media between the Unsub and the captain of the air-

craft until about five ninutes after the aircraft departed

the Seattle-Tacoma Intornational Airport when she was instruct-

ed to so to the cockpit by the Unsub.

The hijacker's instructions after receiving

the money wexe vague.

He probably wanted to jump from the

aircraft as soon as

possible after the takeoff.

The hi-

jacker put two of the parachutes, a back pack and

a front

pack, on prior to take

off.

He also wanted the air stairs

lowered prior to takeoff, which subsequently proved to be

impossible.

Finally the hijacker jumped as soon as practi-

cal after the stairs were lowered in flight.

was delayed from jumping by the trouble

he experienced in

lowering the air stairs and by the fact he was not provided

a knapsack but rather a small white canvas bag which he had

to affix to her person utilizing parachute shroud lines from

an unused parachute.

The plane departed Sea-Tac at 7:36 PM. Some four

or five minutes after take-off,

was sent to the

cockpit by the hijacker.

Some ten minutes after she entered

the cockpit, one of the officers received a call on the

interphone

from the

hijacker, advising he could not get

the ain

stairs down. The pilot then leveled off the aircraft

and reduced the air

speed.

Within a very short time, the

officer's panel showed that the stairs had been lowered

and approximately five minutes later, (8:05 PM), the officer

contacted the hijacker who said everything was okay. That was

the last communication with the hijacker.

pack chute and a back type chute were found on the plane.

The missing chest pack chute, sometimes referred to as an

emergency chute, is a

training, pack "dumnied up" to 100k

like a good one:

The missing back pack chute is non-steerable

and anyone utilizing this type chute would have no chance of

slowing down or picking his spot on which to land.

Also located in sear 18 E of the aircraft at Reno,

was a black clip-on tie which fontained a tie clasp described

as yellow gold in color with a white pearl circular stone

in the center.

The label in the tie bore the name "Town-

craft"

and bore Store 13, Penneys. The label in this tic

showed it to be a

"Snapper" patent type tie.

Investiga-

tion in Las

Vegas indicated that this type sold for about

$1.50, that it was

about a year to a year and a hali old,

and it was a

favorite item for individuals such as

waiters,

bushoys and bartenders.

Stewardess

has said that

this tie was probably the Unsub's and other witnesses have

indicated that he wore a sinilar type tie.

Located in the ashtray utilized by the Unsub were

eight cigarette butts, seven of which have been identified

by the FBI Laboratory

as Raleigh filter tip cigarettes and

the eighth cigarette is probably the same. These cigarettes

are sold in a "soft pack".

The two seats which she had observed to be oc-.

cupied by the unknown subject were processed for fingerprints.

In addition the telephone, the area around the rear door,

the rear door and four plastic drinking glasses found in

trash receptacle by the back door were also processed

for

fingerprints.

In addition, a cloth towel affixed to the

rear of one of the seats reportedly occupied by the unknown

subject was ramoved and examined by Reno Agents.

On that

towel was noted what appeared to be a short human hair.

The FBI Laboratory by communication dated Decem-

ber g, 1971, advised that an examination of the towel sub.

mitted by the bas Vegas Office, disclosed a brown head hair

clapping and a brown limb hair, both of Caucasian origin.

report continued that the head hair clipping is suitable

for significant comparison results, but that the linb hair

possesses to few unique microscopic characteristics to be

of value for that purpose.

The Laboratory also advised that the hairs obtain-

ed from the towel have been

mounted on a glass microscopic

slide.

They suggested that if microscopic comparisons between

between the head hair clipping and a known head hair sample

were desired, that the glass microscopic slide containing

the hair clipping, should be resubmitted to the Laboratory

by the Las Vegas Offica.

The contents of the ashtray, the towel. and the

microscopic slide were returned by the Laboratory to the

Las Vegas Office and are being held by the Las Vegas Divi-

sion as evidence.

Ransom money in the amount of $200,000 was made

up entirely of used, random 20 dollar bills.

It was obtain-

First National Bank, Main Office, and

was part of a ransom package of $250,000. which had been

maintained by the bank. for such emergencies.

The backare

measured approximately one foot by one foot by einht or

nine inches and weighed 19 pounds. .

A check of the Federal. Aviation Administration

flight section at Portland International Airport reflected

that on November 24, 1971 between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM,

there was a ceiling of 5,000 feet, 3,500 feet broken clouds,

and

at 1,500 feet

scattered and broken clouds at times

with a wind of 12-14 knots.

The temperature at the end of

the air stairs at the time of the jump was approximately

00 C.

On October 5, 1972, Mr. DONALD H. NIROP, President,

Vorthwest Orient Airlines, Minneapolis-saint Paul

Interna-

tional Airport, advised he authorized a finers fee of

$25,000 total reward of 15% for any portion of the ransom

money that is returned.

In addition, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, a

local newspaper in Seattle, has offered $5,000 for inforna-

tion leading to the arrest and conviction of Unsub.

on 1/0/72, the NYA 727 which was

actually involved

in the hijacking, was flown to seattle, by

tor the purpose of conducting a test to see if the "pressure

bump" experienced during the hijacking, was caused by some-

thing

The conclusion fron that test was that the cabin

pressure change occurred when the stairs were forced upraid

by the air pressure after the weight had been ichover.

according tol

the test was performed, the occurrence was identical. with

FIRST TERRAIN SEARCH

The purpose of the first terrain search was to

search for possible evidence left behind by Unsub and to

find the renains of Unsub assuming he made an unsuccessful

jump.

The first terrain search commenced at 2:00 PM on

March 21, 1972 with 218 Army troops including officers,

20 Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and 9 helicopters.

The

area to be searched covered approxi-

mately 25 square miles.

Due to snowfall in search area on March 25, 1972,

the search was

temporarily held up.

Army troops remained

on location and the search resumed

at 12:00 Noon on

March 26, 1972. The search was temporarily discontinued

at 12:00

Noon March 30, 1972 to allow search personnel to

rest and enjoy the Easter Holiday. The Army search equip-

ment was retained at search headquarters at Merwin Park.

• with 265 Army personnel and 20 Agents.

The search recommended 7:15 Anil 8, 1972, •

sleet and

freezing rain hampered search on April 12, 1972. Remaining

areas to be searched were reached only by. helicopter in-

sertion of search personnel and landing zones in most

cases were under 6 to 12 inches of snow.

The search of the entire area was completed at

1:00 PM, April 17, 1972 with nothing found.

HUNTERS SEARCH

Prior to the 1972 hunting season; the following

new search area is partially outside the first area. (See

maps.)

It is felt that if Unsub's parachute opened, he

is no longer in the southwest Washington area, but if his

parachute did not open he would be in a corridor along

the flight path.

The time of jump is known, and an area

approsinately one mile by seven miles represents the area

Unsub would have landed in if his parachute did not open.

Because some of the above corridor fell in the

old or first terrain search area, only an area 2 miles by

1/2 mile was searched during the

second terrain search.

The second terrain search commenced March 12,

1973, and involved 10 Special Agents of the Seattle Office.

It was temporarily interrupted on March 16 and resumed again

FAA RECORDS

The Seattle Division advised the Bureau by Nitel

on june 8, 1972 of the following infornation concerning

the Federal Aviation Adninistration records for licensed

pilots:

In considering the feasability of checking FAA

records for all licensed pilots, the Oklahoma City Office

has advised that FAA Aeronautical Center maintains records

oi aven 850,000 licensed pilots.

These records are filed

by name

or license certificate number, but not by age.

Further, they do not include photographs of each licensed

pilot.

The FAA at Oklahona City advises that records are

permanently maintained at FAA on those pilots whose licenses

have been revoked, expired or lapsed.

with infrared inapery, that efforts to locate the attache case

by this means would probably prove futile.

Thei terrain, no

described, would neutralize any effort, particularly if

trees and mountains are part of its makeup.

Further explained

was the necessity for the presence of heat which would mor

to be generated by the object (attache case)

in contrast to

the urrounding terrain for successful infrared high resolution

photography.

The size of the attache case provides a poor

tarpet for any type of acrial photography, including visual

photography.

All three individuals intervieved continued to

express their nerative feelings as to the success

of either of

the aerial photography procodures in this particular instance.

The Alexandria Division vas requested to deternine

the

feasibility of routing a visual aerial photography training

mission over the area of interesi.

Alexandria advised by

airtel dated February 8, 1973, that I

was contacted and he advised that

he had made inquiry into this matter and stated that in the

event

Seattle wished to have military assistance in this mation

then Seattle should request the Director to subnit a letter

of roquest to the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense,

Office of the Secretary of Defense, Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

20301. In this letter the full particulars of the matter should

be set forth as well as whether or not the Rureau or Department

of Justice is willing to observe the additional cost if any

to the Air Force.

advised that he could not state

positively that

the request would be granted, however, advised

that it was his opinion that if this were to

be a reimbursable

project, that it would probably receive more favorable action.

However,

in any svent, upon receipt of the letter a conference

would be held within the appropriate military organization to

ascertain the feasibility of such missions and the Rurcau would

be properly notified.

In view of the above information no further request

was made to have a visual aerial photopraphy training mission

at this time.

Consideration may be given to this type of

survey if new mothods or monies become available.

Leads concerning suspects will not be set forth

in this report as

they are being handled by separate com-

munication.

There are currently 637 suspects, 470 of whom have

been eliminated. New suspects are being developed and

systematic elimination of these suspects continues.

In an effort to facilitate interoffice communi-

cations, it is requested that all field offices originating

NORJAK communications, not only refer to the appropriate

communications but also include the suspects) name and

alias(es) if known on the first page under the title NORJAK.

For the information of all field offices, the

Bureau advised by airtel September 15, 1972, that this is

the only aircraft hijacking in which

the subject has not

been identified and apprehended nor the ransom money

recovered.

All leads in this important case are to be

set forth expeditiously.

The investigation of this case

is to be vigorously pursued in all facets in order

it to a successful completion.

It is noted that the investigative period overlaps

previous NORJAK reports.

This has been done since previous

reports were not distributed to all field offices.

It is noted that Unsub in this matter

is almost

universally called "D. B. COOPER" by the press,

the public,

and even by Bureau personnel. Factually, there is no basis

ror this alias.

As a possible explanation for the existence

of the alias "D, B. COOPER" the following sequence oi

events is offered:

While the hijacking was in progress on the evening

of November 24,

1971, it was established that a

shown four artists' composites,

two black and white and two

colored, depicting the individual known as D. B. Cooper who

skyjacked Northwest Orient Flight Number 305 on November 24, 1971.

Iviewed the four artists'

composites and stated in her

judgment, the plack and white artist's composite without the

sunglasses looks just likel

John Scott

Mazel who died of a heart attack in November, 1974, in Scottsdale,

Arizona, at the age of 59.

She noted in addition to the information she furnished

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Charlottesville, Virginia,

on April 11, 1980, John Scott Maze did

smoke cigarettes of the

filter type but she could not recall the brand.

She also noted he was always extremely polite, even to

her whom, he did not care for at all.

She noted the composite she identified as looking just

like John Scott Maze, looked like him without the "David Niven"

type mustache he always wore.

She also recalled he alwas talked at a low modulation as

he had an adversity towards loud noise.

She added, she talks loud

and that was one of the things Maze did not like about her.

advised she has papers and photographs stored away

and if she locates anything which would be of further value to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Maze, she will contact

the interviewing Agent and 'furnish it to him.

In conclusion she stated in her juagment, the composite

picture she identified is a picture of John Scott Maze, and Maze's

complexion was even more tan than the complexion depicted in the

colored composites when she last saw Maze in person in 1972.

Crime

On 11/22/71, a lone white male boarded Northwest

Orient Flight 305 at Portland, Oregon.

At approximately

3:22 p.m., while the flight was en route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated to the stewardess that his briefcase

contained a bomb,

which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safey of the 36 passengers aboard the

plane.

When the aircraft landed in Seattle, Washington,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received his. parachutes and money, the hijacker

allowed all passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane.

that all Agents would be in a position to cover any leads

concerning this matter and, in addition, to aid them in

answering questions concerning this matter, which will surely

come up as the five-year anniversary of captioned crime draws

near.

Due to the voluminous nature of this case, a report

was not prepared in that it was determined that the

use of a

to the Agent personnel in Seattle.

It is felt this will satisfy the inspection require-

serial nunbors of the $20 bills used in captioned case.

This conclusion was made even after this office attempted

to point out how such publication of the bills could

increase their circulation.

After one of the newspapers had said

it had no interest in publishing the serial numbers, this infor-

nation was passed on to the other paper to consider the exclusive-

ness it would have in publishing the scrial numbers. This

approach also proved unproductive.

Contacts with other neuspapers in this Division were

Enclosed are four (4) artists composites,

two black and white, and two color; depicting the

NORJAK unsub with and without glasses.

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient

Flight #305 at Portlard,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated

to the stewardess that his brief case contained

a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines complied with

his instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and

the

two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a southerly

direction and fly at a low altitude and slow speed

which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened

during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where

the plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the

hijacker, two parachutes, and the ransom money had

disappeared when the plane was inspected at Rel24-8/4968

For the information of the Minneapolis Division,

the enclosed lists were disseminated as suggested in referenced

concerning the new ransom proposals.

Timing is critical if

Contact made with

_ Longview Daily News largest

newspaper (circulation 26,000) in Longview RA territory on 5/27/76.

stated while his paper was willing to cooperate in the

venture of publishing serial numbers of NORJAK bills he felt the

cost was prohibitve since such a publication would probably take a

full page in the newspaper.

However he stated that when and if

definite plans are made by the FBI re the publication his paper

would consider putting in the numbers on a one time basis.

He made available to the writer a paste up sheet which is

what is used to

set stories,

articles etc. in the paper and

said

this could possibly assist the Bureau in determining size of

page and content.

One other newspaper in RA terrotory is Daily Chronicle,

centralia, Washington and they stated they also would have to

, size of item to be dublished etc. before

Ithis suggested that the paste up sheet be used for placing

therein the serial numbers

which could then be made available to

RAs for further contacts with newspapers, magazines etc..

The writer received the distinct impression in aabove newspaper

contacts that papers, looking at the loss of possibly one or two

ages for publication of the numbers would re t eticent to publist

same.
