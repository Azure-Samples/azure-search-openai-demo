I do not have a telephone or I would have contacted you in that manner.

I believe that I may have information which could prove useful in the

a good deal of deliberation before making the decision to write this

letter.

This deliberation spanned nearly a year, and perhaps, a good

deal of that time was spent in watonful waiting with the hopes that

Cooper would be found or caught.

on my part---if I am wrong, I sincerely hope that this will have been handled

in such a way as not to have adversely effected the person that I be-

lieve may be Cooper.

I would greatly prefer giving this information to you in person, or to one

of the Agents there that I would remember, and I would prefer to do this in

Photos of the captioned individual were previously

displayed to witnesses in this matter and he was not found

identical or similar to the hijacker.

He is described by

associates as a blond headed, blue eyed, light to medium

complexioned, Caucasian male and not Latin in appearance.

Based on the above, it would not appear he should be

considered as a

likely suspect,

however, in view of his highly

unusual activities and the results of recent extensive invest

igation at Los Angeles, it would appear investigation 1s

warranted to postively eliminate him as a suspect in this matter

and to ascertain if he is the subject of any other crines,

either Federal or local.

Instant matter pertains to the most recent

queries by the producers of the CBS show, "60 Minutes",

who are apparently considering the "NORJAK" investiga-

tion for one of its shows.

For record purposes, on

5/4/78, SAC, Seattle, received a call from NORMAN GORIN,

whose business card shows him as "Producer, CBS News,

A Division of CBS Inc., 524 West 57 Street, New York,

New York,

10019", who indicated he was then

in Portland,

Oregon doing background on the

"NORJAK" investigation.

GORIN indicated he had permission from FBIHQ (Supervisor

P to interview SA RALPH P. HIMMELSBACH,

Portland Division, concerning this matter, and that he

was intending to thereafter come to Seattle and inter-

view me.

I indicated my surprise that permission had been

this matter had been discussed with FBIHQ, cooperation with

CBS had not been authorized.

I personally spoke with

Supervisor _

I who indicated that MIKE WALLACE had called

him on a number of occasions regarding the possibility of a

show and that the Bureau had approved Portland and later

Seattle, as Office of Origin, being contacted by GORIN.

I returned GORIN's call and informed him of the above and

it was agreed to meet on 5/5/78 at my office.

Mx. GORIN came to my office at the appointed hour

at the

and to approximately the no to there neena this

investigation, and SAL

who is the Media

sentative for the Seattle Office.

GORIN indicated he had spoken at length with SA

HIMMELSBACH, whom he described as being the "Case Agent",

concerning background information

about captioned matter.

I first informed GORIN of the

• administrative breakdown

of an investigation as to Office of Origin, Case Agent,

Lead Agent, etc., and that in this investigation, the Case

Agent was

and that the Lead Agent in the Portland

Division was SA HIMMELSBACH. I then made available to GORIN,

summary contained in ReBUtel dated 5/5/78

and explained to him the necessity of keeping a certain

amount of "identifiers" confidential as this was a pending

GORIN asked a multitude of questions deal-

ing with: specific comments of the Unsub; the denomina-

tions of money that he wanted; type(s) of parachutes asked

for and received; any comments he made to stewardesses; etc.

In

a number of these areas,

it was necessary, for the

reasons stated above, to merely

reply "no comment"

, and

again refer to the fact that this was

a pending investigation

and we needed certain information kept confidential to either

prove or disprove that a particular individual is or is

not the Unsub.

Being perfectly candid, it was obvious that GORIN

was not entirely pleased with his trip to Seattle and referred

to information that he had received from SA HIMMELSBACH Of

the Portland Office and the fact that he had been so fre-

quently quoted in the news media. I informed Mr. GORIN that

probably too much information had already been released but

this

was a most unusual case.

I also suggested that per-

haps

"60 Minutes" could do a

positive story about all of

the other hijacking cases which we had solved rather than

a negative story about one which is still being investi-

gated. I pointed out that this is

an on-going investigation

which

has gone into the background of almost 950 suspects

with approximately 910 of them being cleared and that this

information is contained in

almost 100 volumes of files.

He implied that we had fully cooperated with other

news media representatives in this matter to which I replied

that

insofar as

I was concerned, we had given all of the

representatives about the same information.

I also brought

to his attention the fact that the last time the FBI had

cooperated with "60 Minutes", one of the narrators had in-

sisted on an interview with CLARENCE M. KELLEY, the then

Director of the FBI, immediately after he had suffered a

great personal tragedy.

I commented

that this interview

was supposed to summarize Mr. KELLEY's thoughts on the

Bureau,

the changes which he had instituted, morale, etc.,

and that after granting

the interview, which covered a

period of about 2½ hours (actual time

• believed to be closer

to 4½ hours), not one second of

the interview was contained

in the show.

I told GORIN that

in my opinion, his program

lost a lot of credibility among

Bureau personnel because

of such

action.

At that point, he jokingly held his hands

up as if in surrender and indicated that he had nothing to

do with that particular program.

I urther pointed out to GORIN that no matter how

much "60 minutes" wished to theorize, take things out of

context, "fice

over-ride" my statements or any other Bureau

representative, it was in their power to either make us look

good or bad on

this investigation and that we had no recourse

or platform to publicly rebutt any misquotes, incorrect in-

ferences,

etc. I noted, however, that, the bottom line, inso-

far as this or any other investigation in which the Bureau

is involved, is to be

able to prove or disprove either a

suspect is or is not identical with the Unsub and that if

we release all of our

"Identifiers" to the general public

through the news media, it becomes virtually impossible to

prove the case in a court of law.

In summary, GORIN, I am sure, expected to virtually

be given a

free hand in this matter but I feel certain that

he understands our position. In all honesty, we cooperated

with him as much as we could and gave him no more but no less

than we have given any other media representative.

agrees that this case, as in all other cases, should have the

Office of Origin as the spokesman.

Therefore, and in order

to avoid any further conflicts

ready been done by the SAC, specifically advise SA RALPH P.

HIMMELSBACH that he should

this investigation to Seattle; 2) that if Portland feels

with the Media as noted in Portland Airtel of 5/8/78,

should consider designating Portland as Office of origin,

noting that an indictment was obtained in that Division;

3) that serious consideration be given to discouraging CBS

from pursuing this investigation for a myriad of reasons,

not the least of which is that this is a pending case,

where there are a limited number of "identifiers" left which

have not been released to the public and to show how we

have eliminated some of the suspects (specifically COFFELT) ,

could jeopardize the investigation.

In addition we should

keep in mind the manner in which "60 Minutes" treated the

FBI the last time we cooperated with that program.

Also, we

should recognize that CBS is a "past master" of utilizing

inuendoes, flashbacks, conflicting testimony, etc.

to

sensationalize any story.

Seattle will continue to act as spokesman for the

Bureau in this important investigation, UACB.

WALLACE told BOYNTON that COFFELT knew J. EDGAR HOOVER and HUBERT

WALLACE told BOYNTON that it is CBS' opinion that the

reason the FBI does not consider COFFELT a legitimate suspect and

the obvious reluctance to discuss COFFELT of SA RALPH P.

HIMMELSBACH and SAC REED of Seattle is because COFFELT is obviously

an informant or an asset of some sort of the FBI, and additionally,

was a personal friend of J. EDGAR HOOVER and HUBERT HUMPHREY. In

Portland, Oregon

Dear Sir,

I have a suggestion which might help you in looking for the

man, D. B. Cooper, who hijacked your passenger plane in 1971.

Re-

cently

gave us some weekly newspapers and the story

of the hijacking and ransoming was in one of them

There is a clue in the story, in fact two, First: the story

says there were three jet fighters following your airliner, yet they

did not see Cooper jump. Now the reason is this: he did not jump.

He was too smart for that. He had a crate for big trunk, box, or

something similar) in the freight compartment. This box or trunk

probably had straps around it and it was nailed down tight, except

for one end which appeared to be nailed down, alsoibut this end

could be opened by cooper by simply turning a key in a hidden lock.

Also the hinges and lock paets were hidden inside the box and Cooper

could close and lock the box end from inside. TH$/SKS*#/5A4$/74458

wéte/t In the box was a weight (it could of been a big block of

wood so one man could roll it or could have been sonething else,

possibly a container of sand or water--something when dumped could

not be suspicious from the ground. Cooper opened the crate, rolled

the block or pushed the sand or water out into space--it weighed

about as much as he and the parachutes and money weighed.

Cooper put the chutes, the money in the box, then he crawled in

and fastened the lid from the inside. The next day you delivered

him to his address.

He probably shipped a few boxes first, to make sure which flight

they got on. The boses probably said fragile on them--so he wouldn't

be handled rough, and found out. Check all large shipments that day.

Also check for false addresses.

SEARCHES.

The other clue is this: Cooper knew an awful lot about airplanes:

how to fold parachutes, that there was a phone in back, that the pilot

could open back door fron cabin; now since this is so he also knew

the extreme danger of jumping over rugged country at 8:00 o'clock

November 24, 1971 since it was stormy that night. It would've been

suicide, and he knew it. He/liff So he did not jump. He was snug

in his box, until you delivered him.

If you check my idea and find him, do I get the reward? We are

that MAStERSON could have had nothing to do with the

re-identification to bring pressure to bare for such an

operation. He stated he was advising the Portland FBI Office

inasnuch as members of the fanily indicated that they

were going to take the natter to the FBI since they had

been turned down by the sheriff's office.

In view of the above circunstances and considering

NEWS INQUIRY

Arthur G. Barger, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI

for the State of Oregon, today acknowledged that a portion of a

plastic decal which is known to be used by Boeing 727 aircraft

was located during November, 1978 by a hunter in a remote area of

Cowlitz County, Hashington. The decal, which is white with red

lettering, has been identified by officials of Northwest Orient

Airlines as being similar to decals used on aircraft of the type

hijacked by the person popularly known as "D. B. Cooper" the night

before Thanksgiving, 1971.

The decal was found approximately twelve miles due east

of Castle Rock, Washington, near Toutle River Park. This location

is generally within the area into which Cooper is believed to

have parachuted following the departure of the aircraft fron

Seattle-Tacona Airport.

No additional searches of the area are planned at this

time.

In show business that advice is right up there

things get too far-fetched.

The first, postmarked from Chicago, thanked the

Cricket for the invitation. "I won't say I will

accept, and I won't say I won't," the writer said.

The brief note was signed by Daniel B, Cooper.

The second letter, mailed in Los Angeles, was

received late last month after the play opened.

Written on the same type of green notepaper with

apparently the same typewriter, it was longer and

full of grammatical errors.

The writer claimed to have visited Minneapolis

them in my own actual life."

What do you do with two such letters? Copy them

and put out a news release, of course

Another question is whether anybody at the

Cricket really believes the letters could be genuine

literary products by D.B. Cooper. A spokesman for

the theater said Producing Director Bill Semans •

"firmly believes" the letters are on the level.

But they don't agree as to when he died. Law

enforcement people have long asserted that Cooper

died when he jumped from the Northwest 727

somewhere over southwest Washington state. Or-

lock believes Cooper survived the jump, but later

Orlock's play is based, rather whimsically; on a

letter that was printed in the New York Times

about three weeks after the hijacking. In it, Cooper

claimed to be dying of cancer and added that he

had hijacked the plane in the hopes of gaining "a

rew fast grains of peace of mind."

"The tone of it seemed really quite honest to

me," said Orlock.

THE FBI'S CLAiM is based on a number of tac-

tors - the belief that the hijacker didn't know

i wilderness country in the Pacific Northwest. Worst

of all, Cooper took two parachutes with him - one

a small emergency chute used by stunt flyers and

the other a training chute used for demonstrations.

The big chute was sewn shut and the smaller chute,

if used under ideal conditions by an expert, proba-

bly would have resulted in a broken ankle.or leg.

So who was D.B. Cooper? For a while he was a

folk hero of sorts, immortalized by songs, bumper

stickers and T-shirts. "D.B. Cooper, Where Are

You?" was the song title and bumper sticker ques

He was macho. He was daring. He didn't hurt:

anybody, but he ripped off a big corporation. And

he beat the fuzz.

ORLOCK, WHO WAS obsessed with the letter?

printed in the New York Times, saw D.B. Cooper as :

a sick little man whose miserable life concluded

with a ritualized act, something that put it all in

order. He thinks Cooper died 14 months after the

years ago.

in fact, D.B. Cooper.

In an effort to resolve this problem, I provide the

following questions for your client to answer:

1) Did D.B. Cooper purchase his airline ticket from a

man or a woman? And was that man or woran young or old?

the atrplane?) Did D.B. Cooper stand or sit while waiting to board

3) When D.B. Cooper boarded the airplane, was he among

the first passengers to board, in the middle, or one of the last

4) Precisely where did D.B. Cooper sit in the airplane?

Right or left side of the plane, window or aisle seat, in the front

or the back of the airplane or towards the middle?

5) What were the sexes of any persons D.B, Cooper sat

next to?

6) In precisely what manner did D.B. Cooper communicate

his demands? And what was cormunicated?

there of the individual who originally furnished

information alleging that unsub and DAVID BRYANT COFFELT WErE

identical. That individual has persisted in his allegation that

COFFELT was unsub despite the fact that his original story does

not square with the known facts of the case.

Portland, Oregon

January 12, 1980

PRESS RELEASE

Arthur G. Barger, Special Agent in Charge of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for Oregon, has announced

a development in a crime which began on the night of November 24,

1971, at Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon, and has

become widely known since that time as the D. B. Cooper Hijacking

Case.

On the night before Thanksgiving, 1971, a man who gave

the name Dan Cooper bought a one-way ticket on Northwest Airlines

Flight 305 from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington.

Upon departing Portland International Airport, Cooper notified a

stewardess that he was hijacking the aircraft and displayed to

her what he said was a bomb in his briefcase. The flight proceeded

to Seattle, where after maintaining a holding pattern for several

hours, it was permitted to land and refuel. After $200,000

and four parachutes demanded by the hijacker were brought on

board, he released all of the passengers and all but four members

of the crew.

The flight then took off and proceeded south

through Washington toward Reno, Nevada. The hijacker instructed

that the flaps and gear remain lowered and the rear stair door

open. As the aircraft passed over LaCenter, Washington, cabin

2-161-412

b7C

DB Cooper-43218

## Page 285

..-

pressure fluctuation was observed, which was

later determined to

indicate his departure from the aircraft through the rear

stairwell door. Since that time no trace of the hijacker,

the parachutes, or the money has been found until Sunday, •

February 10, 1980.

On that date while on an outing with their children,

Mr. and Mrs. Harold Dwayne Ingram of Vancouver, Washington,

discovered a sun of money partially buried by sand in the

north river bank of the Columbia River, approximately five miles

down river from the U.S. Interstate 5 bridge crossing between

Portland and Vancouver, Washington. The Ingrams contacted the

FBI and an examination of the badly decomposed $20 bills

reveals that they bear serial numbers identical to a portion of

those given to the hijacker. Because of the decomposed nature

of the bills an exact estimate of the recovered money is not

possible pending a laboratory examination, however, it appears

to be several thousand dollars. The packaging and the numbered

sequence indicate that the bills have not been separated and

are in much the same order as when given to the hijacker.

The bills will be sent immediately to the FBI Laboratory for

additional examination.

It appears logical that the package of bills could

have been carried downstream on one of the Washington tributaries

of the Columbia River to the site where they were found.

Special Agents of the FBI from Oregon and Washington

have secured the area and commenced an intensive search.

posedly bailed out, started holding

an annual "D.B. Cooper Day" to

commemorate the event. The fes-

Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, assisted

by officers of the Clark County, Washington, Sheriff's Depart-

ment, conducted a search of a section of beach on the bank of.

1980, at the same location as that from which the bills were

removed by the Ingram family on lebruary 10, 1980.

It has been determined through the records of the

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the material on the beach

was deposited there as the result of a dredging operation in.

the Columbia River in August, 1974. The assistance of a

geologist has been obtained in an effort to determine whether

or not the money was depoisted at that location as a part of

the spoilage of the dredging operation.

Ihe meticulous search

Re: D. B. Cooper

Dear Mr. Baker:

We have become aware that some of the money given to D. B.

Cooper has been recovered. This letter is to advise you

that our client, Globe Indemnity Company, reimbursed Northwest

Airlines for the money which was given to D. B. Cooper. It

is our opinion, based on the terms of the contract pursuant

to which such indemnification was made, that Globe Indemnity

is entitled to receive any recovery made until the full

amount of indemnification

has been repaid.

We would appreciate being kept advised of what recovery is

or has been made.

Material dredged from the river channel in the

Columbia River was placed in several locations on or near

The drodge material deposited at the site where

the noney was located came from the north half of the ship

channel, which is 300 feet wide, between river nile 96

91,100 cubic yards of fill.

The channel is maintained at 40 fect in depth

and all the material above 40 feet is drodged out. The

dredge "Washington" of the General Construction Company

Tena Bar

in Vancouver, Washington,

where portions of $20 bills had been

found.

These $20 bills were among the money furnished a person

identifying himself as D. B. COOPER during a 1971 airplane hich

jacking attempt.

Iwas interviewed by SA

of the Portland, Oregon, FBI Office.

Jadvised that he found the beach area

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer, and below that an older sand layer.

The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the

sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money. This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were not severely damaged or rusted.

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dredge) sand was a mix-

ture of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size. Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the Columbia

River at this site in 1974,l

stated this clay layer

in all probability, was deposited during that 1974 dredging.

The

older sands, which were light in color and uniform in texture

and which were found below the clay lump sand, were deposited

prior to the 1974 dredging.

The upper six inches to eight inches of re-

worked beach sand is the active layer which is currently being

based this belief on three facts.

The first

fact being that the money was rounded off on the corners, which

would indicate a rolling motion and would indicate the flow

of the river.

The second fact was that the money was found

in the surfade layer of the upper reworked beach sand. The

third fact was that the distribution of the money was

1n

this surface layer only, and none was found to be in the

post dredging sand. When reminded of the fact that the

rubber bands holding the money together were still in place,

out extremely brittle and crumbled upon touch, l

stated that the condition of the rubber bands would

tend to lend credence to the assumption that the money had

been at the location where found a longer period of time.

Even

with this, he still felt the money was not at the site for more

than a year. At the height found, the money was definitely de-

posited more than four years after the dredging of the Columbia

River in 1974. He also added that he felt certain that the money

did not work its way up through the post dredging sand to the

upper layer.

advised that this could be caused by many reasons, but most

probably caused by the different elevations of the beach sand

Regarding

the fact that the money itself was remark-

This could also be the reason that the rubber bands were still in

The money would not have lasted for more than a year in

He added that tragments of the money

could have been washed anywhere down stream in the Columbia, but

he doubted that any additional money found would be as well pre-

served unless it had been deposited in an upper layer of sand.

Re: D. B. Cooper

Dear Sir:

This letter is written in observation of recent events publicized

in the newspapers regarding the discovery of money materials along

the Columbia River in Southwestern Washington.

The newspaper accounts of this discovery did not indicate that any

further investigation was being done regarding the geologic factors

occurred to me that there may be abundant information available

that might not ordinarily be pursued in this type of investigation.

Accordingly, the following suggestions are offered for your consider-

ation:

1.

Sediment trapped within the material and surrounding

material may provide clues as to the source areas from

which the sand and material were transported from.

2. The sediment material may provide a clue as to other likely

areas along the Columbia where additional materials might be

deposited.

3. Analysis of the local stratagraphy and sedimentology may

give an indication of the date that the materials were deposited

at the location of discovery.

traveled and thereby give additional clues as to the

source from which the material was derived.

Significant information may still be available at the site. If

any samples were taken of material before the local sediment was

disturbed, those samples would be very useful in any analysis. Also,

photographs may be useful in reconstructing the depositional circum-

stance in which the money materials were located. If not, the next time

a discovery takes place, care should be taken to acquire the geologic

information from the site before excavation takes place. In any case.

PRESS INQUIRY

Arthur G. Barger, Special Agent in Charge of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation for the State of Oregon,

announced today the $20 bills located on a sandy beach near

Vancouver, Washington, on February 10, 1980, and verified

as a portion of the ransom money given to the hijacker of

a 727 jetliner at Seattle, Washington, on November 24, 1971,

has been examined by the Laboratory Division of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation. The results of the examination

place the amount recovered at approximately $5800. As

expected, no fingerprints were present on the bills.

The examination reveals that the bills had, in fact, been

immersed in water for an extended period and silt deposits

among the bills indicate a probability that they were

washed onto the site where they were found rather than

having been dredged from the Columbia River.

Parachute

not that

of missing

skyjacker

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

KELSO, Wash. - The

FBI says it has ruled out

any connection between

a partly buried para-

chute found in a wooded

area of southwest Wash-

ington and the 8-year-

old disappearance of

skyjacker D.B. Cooper.

The parachute was

found by logger Darrell

G. Ray and turned over

to Cowlitz County sher-

iff's deputies Monday,

after a friend told Ray

the discovery might be

a clue to the nation's

only unsolved sky-

jacking.

But Bill Williams, an

FBI spokesman

in

Portland, Ore., saic

• Tuesday, "We have de-

termined after examin-

ing the chute that it is

not related to the case at

all, even though it was

found in the general

area where Cooper left

the plane."

DB Cooper-43262

## Page 328

A man using the name

of Cooper boarded a

Northwest Airlines jet

headed from Portland to

Seattle.on Now-24, 1971.

While airborne, he

threatened to blow up

the plane with a bomb

he claimed to have in a

briefcase unless he was

given $200,000.

After the plane landed .

in Seattle, Cooper freed

the passengers and was

given the money and

four parachutes. He or-

dered the plane to fly to

Reno, but opened the

rear boarding ramp of

the Boeing 727 some-

where en route — be-

lieved

to be over

southwest Washington

— and bailed out.

No trace of Cooper or

the money has been

found.

Records indicated

that Cooper was given

white parachutes, Wil-

liams said, while the

parachute found in the

woods was orange and

white.

Authorities have said

they believe Cooper died

somewhere in the woods

after bailing out. More

than 1,000 persons were

considered and rejected

as suspects in the case.

located directly across the street fron the building housing

the Portland Office.

Arrangements were made for the feed and

the PC was a part of the network news in progress. NBC and

ABC national network crews arrived on 2/13/80.

The PC was very well attended and took place as scheduled

at 3:00 p.m. The PC included ASAC

During the PC, the location

of the search site was revealed.

Within a few minutes after the press conference

television crews and other media representatives began arriving

at the search site where they were escroted to the appropriate area

and briefed.

The telephone inquiries began during the PC and con-

tinued into the late evening. Clerical employees utilized a

press release in replying to the inquiries. SAs extended their

comments beyond the press release and in many instances the

conversations were broadcast live in Portland and distant cities

by radio.

On 2/13/80, SA

was stationed at

the search site to assist the media. Telephone inquiries con-

tinued at the Portland and Seattle offices.

Telephonic inquiries have continued. These have

originated with media outlets throughout the United States, and

from outlets in Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand,

SUBJECT: Skyjacking Incident, Alias D. B. Cooper

Dear Sir:

The California Institute of Criminology, located in Hollywood,

California, proposes to do a case study of the skyjacking incident

by alias D. B. Cooper.

Through the institute's Scientific Detection Program being offered

to prospective candidates, the case of alias D. B. Cooper, one of the

most renoun cases of the twentieth century, has been selected.

Therefore, through the permission and cooperation of the Bureau,

the institute proposes to conduct the following case study of:

1.

Microanalysis, neutron activation and spectrographic

voice identification.

2. Naco analysis, handwriting analysis, hypnosis of victims and

voice stress analysis.

3. Data analysis techniques and statistical methods of related

crimes occurred in the past.

4. Data collection sources.

the Campus Security Office of Oregon State Universicy (OSU), made

available the OSU annual yearbooks for the years 1971, 1972,

1973. A review of these yearbooks determined that there was no

entry listed for RALPH DENT HESS.

connon fox graduate students to have no information listed in

the University annual yearbook.

Information from the OSU Registrar's Office determined

there is no photograph on file concerning RALPH DENT HESS.

HESS attended OSU beginning with the summer term of 1971, and

including the fall term, 1971, the winter term, 1972, and did not

include the spring term of 1972.

HESS received a Masters Degree

in Industrial Education in June, 1972.

During his enrollment at

OSU, HESS listed a local address of 141 NW 29th Street, Corvallis,

Oregon, with a home of record shown as 789 Hemlock Street, Apt. #4,

Coos Bay, Oregon.

As a graduate student, lESS was not required to attend

class regularly and it would not be possible to determine if

HEGS was in fact at Corvallis, Oregon, on any specific date,

particularly, November 24, 1971. OSU class schedules are kept

for only a period of five years, so it is not possible to determine

the identity of specific classes taken by a student during 1971.

HESS received a Bachelor's Degree fron West Virginia

State University in 1966. He is a graduate of Fairmont High School.

in Fairmont, West Virginia. In addition, DENT attended Fairmont

State College in Fairmont, West Virginia.

He also attended the

University of Missouri at College Park, Missouri, and the University

of West Virginia at morgantown, West Virginia,

He attended the

Re Seattle airtel to Portland, 2/11/81.

Enclosed for Seattle is one packet of four photographs.

Referenced airtel set out leads for enclosed photographs

to be shown to

Eugene, Oregon.

Portland notes that the photograph of suspect, ROBERT

NED BISHOP, was not accompanied by appropriate throw-down photo-

graphs which would be rcquired in the event that L

l makes a positive identification. In view of the

fact that the photograph of BISHOP has been altered by the special

projects unit so as to depict BISHOP with the same hair as shown

In the artist's conception of D.B. COOPER, Portland would have no

way of independently coming up with additional photographs which

are similar in appearance so that the photograph of BISHOP is not

unique.

Prior to the display of any witnesses in this matter,

an appropriate photo spread should be developed to neet any legal

challenge to any identifications which might result.

Portland has placed this case in an RUC status.

The Successful episode of D.B. Cooper.

How he pulled off the job and why the F.B.I.. Havan, t Found him.

To Understand the D.B. Cooper case it is necessary build a e

profile of his character.

First He had to be either extremely Stupid or very inteligent.

Only an extremely stupid person would attempt to parachute

out of a plane at night, over wooded country without knowing

his exact location, which would be unlikely with a stupid person.

Yet that is exactly what many people, including the News

Media and according them the F.B.I.

To further eliminate the Studidity issue, let us examine

why I have eliminated that possibility. At, one time I was

willing to accept the version as

published in the papers, figuring

that the F.B.I. kaew details that were not published.

On Feb 10, 1981 when the $5800.00 was found along

the Columbla river it was practicaly prooff positive that Cooper

was still alive and had escaped with the money. It was reported

at that time that there was a rubber band around the money when

found but that it had broken offwhen the money was picked up.

There is no was that a rubber band would have lasted over nin e

years, euen iff burried. It is also unliked/that there mpuld

be just 5800 dollars in a bundle. there would have been an even

amount for easy countability

Cooper apparently planted that money thereto further

enhance the opinion thiit he had jumped in that area and was

dead. he furthermore devised this scheme to make It easier

for him to spend the money, here is what he planned. He planted

this bundle in the sand on the windward side ofa small dune.

knowing that when a good wind came up it would uncover the sand

rotted away. Hopefully the wind would have peeled off these bills,

one at a time and scatterd thi along the river bank, in the

water and in the bushes. He hoped that fishermen would find

the bills one at a time, and not realizing the source, put them in his po

pocket and later spend then. Figuring that ifs enough of the

moneyshond up that the F.B.I. would stop, looking, assuming that

it was scattered all over, Coopers only mistake was that he

miscalclated so the ruber band was still on, not enough sand

Had been blown away so the bundle was still intact.

Now lets go on the assumption that CooPer was very intelligent.

Here is my Profile of his chAracteristicks.

Cooper worked elther for an Airline, the militays or for

Boeing. He was very well aquainted with the 727, He knew

all the flight characteristics, that the rear door could

be opened in flight, and how to do 1t. He also knew 1f his

activities would affect the trim and how to compensate.

He was himself an accomplish pight, he was an instrument

pilot or at least had considerablé instrument training, especially

with OMNI Navigation. He had considerable experiene flying

over Oregon and Northern California. Knowing in detail the

terain and exact location of all populated areas, open large

fields and all the OMNI (vortac)) stations.

He was an epertenced parachute jumperPossibly in the

m1l1tary, a smoke Junger but nore likely a private parachute

club.

Cooper had at least two acomplaces. "A" got on the 727 earlier.

Maybe at prortland of agt an earlied stop (1f any). He was

one of the first passengers to get on board so few if any

would notice that he had a plece of Carry on luggage which he

put under he seat, He was one of the last to get off at

Seattle, so that in the confusion no one would notice that he

had "Forgot" his luggage. In this luggage there was a palr

of Jump boots, a specially made Jump sult with, pockets, hooks

eto to carry Coopers equipment anda sport parachute. The

chutes @oper asked for were just decoys. one of which was

thrown overboard in a wooded area somewhere along the line.

on the first place he would not have trusted any chute that

was furnished and in the second place a sport schite is

much more manouverable than a standard shute.

Also there

was a portable OMNI receiver, a flashlite, an altalter and

maybe a sull comp ass to use if he missed his taget, also

a small walkie talkie, Some of these items may have been in

the case hete cooper diplaged his suppordy "Bomb"

Here is how they plan was catried out. After negotiation

in seattle Cooper told the pilot where he wanted to go, how high

and how fast to fly and wait route to take, such as V23, Cooper

knew just where this route would lead. Soon axer after the plane

was airborn he opened the rear door, let out an antenna for

his OMNI receiver and started to moniter the flight, With his

OMNI set he could tell elactly if the plane was on the correct

path. By montaring and keeping track of the time from one OMNI

station to another he knew the exact speed. With the OMNI indocator

he knew exactly when each Vottac station was pässed over. If

the plane was to one side or the other he could tell exactly

DB Cooper-43373

how far by recording the time from one angle bearing to another.

## Page 425

He had previously picked out a landing site. It was an area

a short distance past an OMNI station, where there was open

land, no close houses or near any busy road, and where there

was a road his acomplace "B" would be waiting. B, had a flashlite

awalkle talkie to match Coopers, a compassand a direction finder

on his walkle talkie in case Cooper was off target, so they c

could get together quickly.

He was spoted inthe area directly®

Jumping

below Coopers selected Zanting site.

There are several places that fit Cooper requirements.

One is on a course approximately 140 degrees from the Red Bluff

Callf, Vortac Stattion. When he got past the frevious station

he turned to 115.P megacycles and watched the (uni indicator.

when the needle switched from "TO" to"PROM" he timed thetime

It would take the plane over the selected landing site. At

exactly the precise second he jumped, and 1f all calculation

were correct he would be airectly over his ecomplace. At thishhe would

signal on his walkie talkia, "B, would then give a flashlite

signal and he could float down exactly on target. If He were

off a ways he could direct his sport shute to the spot. If

he was too far off they could still use the fishlite to keep

track of each other still further away they could use the walkle

talkle and "B"idirection finder.As each person was very familiar

with this teritory they would have ho trouble spotting his

location precisely.

ANOther importand detail, Cooper was in no immediate deed

of money so he could afford to hide the money and wait.

Coopers reason foxating this. He had some imagined or heal

greavance with someone, probablys and official inthe Airline

and wanted to get even. Maybe he just wanted to show how

smart he was.

PRESS RELEASE

Robert S. Gast, II, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation in Oregon, made the following announcement

today:

During the past three weeks, given the publicity associated

with the l0th anniversary of the D. B. Cooper hijacking and the

release of a movie relating to it, the FBI has received numerous

telephone calls and visits from individuals purporting to be D. B.

Cooper and claiming to have a portion of the ransom, or to have knowledge

of the crime.

Each contact has been evaluated and appropriate

investigation conducted.

At 3 a.M., December A, 1981, officers of the Portland

Police Bureau contacted the Portland Office of the FBI and advised

a clerical employee on duty, that a gentleman, claiming to be D. B.

Cooper, was present at the police headquarters. The information

furnished to the police made it appear highly unlikely that the

individual had been involved in the hijacking. A member of the FBI .

staff then spoke to the man on the phone and asked him several key

questions pertaining to the crime. The man's responses to these

questions were of such a nature that it was apparent he had little

DB Cooper-43376

or no firsthanä knowledge of the event. His personal description

1 64-41-1859

also varied from that of the hijacker.

The Portland Police Bureau officers were asked to photograph

the individual and obtain his full description. A followup

investigation was conducted by the FBI later on Decembest 4.

Based on an evaluation of the incident, it would

appear that this is simply one more of the many hoaxes which

have taken place over the years.

Re Portland teletype to Bureau, 12/7/81.

Referenced teletype set forth information relating to

an Incident on the morning of 12/3/81 in which an individual

claiming to be "D, B. Cooper" presented himself at the Portland

Police Bureau. An officer of the Portland Police Bureau subse-

quently contacted the

Based upon information

asked that the Police Bureau attempt to obtain a photograph and

any other identifying data so this individual could be interviewed

at a later date. This incident became the subject of an article

In the 12/7/81 issue of the "Hashington Post" and inaccurately

identified

Jas a Special Agent and incorrectly stated

that the FBI had no one available to intervier this indlvidual.

As stated in referenced teletype, the Portland Office

has received numerous phone calls from Individuals claining to be

that they have Information as to D. B. Cooper's correct identity.

Most of these calls have been occasioned by the well-publicized

tenth anniversary of the skyjacking, concomitant with a notion

picture release, "In Search of D. B. Cooper."

The producers of

this motion picture offered a $1,000,000 reward if D. B. Cooper

would turn himself in. All calls received on this incident

have been totally without substantiation and/or hoaxes.

Based

upon this, SAC,

Portland, has issued firm instructions to

complaint and night duty personnel that they are to evaluate

any call regarding the skyjacking carefully and not dispatch

investigative personnel unless they belleve there is good

reason to do so.

In this way, every effort is being made to

avoid useless expenditure of valuable Agent time.

Post and eve to ta car a nda dant, advised tre

himsels as D. B. Cooper violied the station

He was questioned by station personnel and immediately

ruled out as being Cooper, since he was unable to answer simple

questions about the skyjacking.

For example, he stated that he

boarded the plane in Seattle and he was unable to give the

correct amount of ransom requested and stated that the money

was in $100 bills. Station personnel were shown a photograph

of the individual appearing at the Portland Police Bureau and

positively identified him as the sane individual who appeared

at the station.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Based upon information developed in this matter, it

Is obvious that this incident was the result of a hoax or from

Patrol Cleris was appropriate and in line with SAC instructions,

and it is recommended that no further action be taken in this

matter.

" An FBI spokesman said Monday thạt

the photo of a man who claimed to be D.B.

Cooper in Portiand last week has no re-

semblance to the composite drawing of

the nation's first skyjacker.

A man who claimed he was Cooper

went to the'Portland Police Bureau's Cen-

tral Precinct early Thursday and said he

/ wanted to turn himself in. Since skyjack-

jing is a federal crime, police called the

FBL.

The FBI told the officer to take a pic-

ture of the man and have him report to

the FBI on Friday. The FBI talked to the

man then by phone.

He failed to appear.

During the telephone conversation, the

FBI asked the man questions only the real

D.B. Cooper could answer. The man could

not answer some questions and gave false

answers to others, according to Bill Wil-

liams, bureau spokesman.

"Based on an evaluation of the incident

it would appear that this is simply one

more of the numerous hoaxes which have

taken place over the years," said Wil-

liams.

Cooper is the name used by a man who

hijacked a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727,

on a flight from Portland to Seattle on

Thanksgiving Eve 1971. He parachuted =

from the plane somewhere over Souths

5208, 0 1 0m the artie and let ret pass

sengers off in Seattle.

"During the past three weeks the pub;

icity associated with the l0th anniver:

ary of the hijacking and the release of a

novie relating to it, the FBI has received

numerous telephone calls and visits from

edge of the crime," said Williams.
