To me this appears to be an act of great social irrespons-

they will make a proper notation on a wavier form, setting

forth the description of the property, and will either go

back to attempt to contact or as an alternative wait until

the search starts and then contact the person prior to going on

the lang.

If a person refuses tovexecute a consent form,

then we will advise them that we will get a search warrant

and conduct a search on that basis.

If we find a company ownership listed for any of

the property, whether it be state, local or U. S. Government,

or private enterprise, we are not going to contact anyone at those

locations since they will probably be workmen.

If it is felt

to be necessary to make contact with the company, or the

state in these cases, we will take steps to contact headguarters

of the various companies for the property wavier.

If the agents working on the securing of the waiver

are in a town, and there are several of these towns in the

search area, they will not go house to house in the town

unless the house has a large amount of property on which

it stands. The agents are staging at the Quay Motel in
