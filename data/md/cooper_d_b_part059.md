UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

May 2, 1972

Los Angeles, California

FBI Agents today arrested two men in the State

of Washington on charges involving an alleged scheme to

dupe a national news magazine representative into buying

a firsthand account of an aircraft hijacking, according to '

Acting Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst.

The FBI identified the arresting men as Donald

of Bremerton, Washington, and

William John Lewis,

Sylvester Murphy, aged 433, of Silverdale, Washington.

Both Murphy and Lewis are real estate promoters.

An authorized complaint charging the arrested

men with violations of the Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property and conspiracy to violate this statute, was

filed at Seattle, Washington on May 2, 1972.

According to the complaint, Lewis, on

February 16, 1972, was in contact with Karl

Fleming, at

that time a contributing editor of Newsweek magazine who was

to Murphy, claiming Murphy was

hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines plane on November 24,

1971, and parachuted

from the aircraft with $200, 000.

Fleming then allegedly paid the men $30,000 for

an exclusive story, pointing out to them that Newsweek would

not support the undertaking but that a partner of Fleming in

Platypus Publications, Incorporated would put up the money.

The FBI advised that both of the arrested men would

appear before a United States Magistrate as soon as possible.

isement.

lle stated that he also received one telephone call

at approximately 1:00 a.m. and he felt that this call came

from the hijacker. His reason for feeling that this caller •

the hijacker was partially the time of day that the call

came and also because he did not hear any background noise

in the call which would indicate that it came from a tavern

and was a crank call. In addition to this, he recognized

the voice of the caller as a man whom he had known and with

whom he had done business in the past. He did not identify

himself to the caller and does not know whether the caller

recognized his voice.

He stated that the caller began his conversation

by stating, "I think we have something to talk about,"

and feeling that this person was probably the hijacker,

he suggested that the individual call him back at another

time in the morning and they would set up an appointment

to get together and discuss the matter.

He never received

i return telephone call from this individual, and althougl

he has had conversations with this individual concerning

other business since the time he received this call he has

not discussed the hijacking with him.

Result of examination:

The bills represented by Q43 were compared with

photographic overlays of the Q43 bills showed the serial

numbers on these bills to be out of register with the serial
