For the Bureau's information on January 6, 1972,

Airlines in Minneapolis. Minnesota, accompanied by

Nprthwest

Northwest Airlines:

Northwest Alrlines; and

with permission of

of Northwest

Airlines, flew the same Boeing 727 aircraft that was hijacked

from Minneapolis to Seattle so that an experiment could be

held endeavoring to simulate the exact flight conditions in

order that it could be determined if the airplane reacted in

the same

way and in that manner when the weight egulvalent

to the estimated weight of the hijacker was ejected from the

alrplane via the back stairs.

Under

diractions, the last three

rows of seats were removed from the alrcraft and special

measuring devices were attached to the rear end of the cabin

so that it could be determined exactly what happened in the

aircraft when the weight was disloaged.. Through the assistance

of members of the U. S. Air Force, three sleds were made on which

were placed sand bag weights, bringing the total weight to

approximately 235 pounds, that being the estimated weight of

the hijacker, the parachute, and the money.

On the morning of January 6, 1972, the Alr Force

provided a tracking plane with sophisticated photographic

eguipment on it, which first swept the surface to insure

that there were no surface crafts in the vicinity, and at that

point the 727 ascended to approximately 7,000 feet over the

Pacific Ocean west of Hogulan, Washngton.

allowed the weighted sled to fall from the end of the stairs.

The employeas of Northwest not only spent considerable

time on this project, but l

had to arrange for the

alrplane to be taken from the flight Iine for a day and one-half

so it could be accomolished.

The representatives of Northwest,

have been extresely helpful during

this entire

Investigation and in view of this extended effort

on their part, it is suggested that the Bureau may desire to

address a letter tol

on the possibility that subject might have rented

an airplane and flown over the area of Southwest washington

or might have chartered a plane for the same purpose, the

following investigation was conducted in the State of washington

but failed to identify the subject:

An artist's conception and composite description of

subject was exhibited to owners and operators of each flying

school,

each airfield and airport, each company renting or

chartering aircraft, and each skydiving school and club.

Similar inquiry has 'been conducted at the Portland

International

Airport and at airports at Aurora and Donald,

Oregon in Marion County. Oregon, and is being conducted through-

out the remaining portion of the State of Oregon.

All skydiving clubs, parachute clubs and affiliated

orcrelated organizations have been and/or are being contacted

nationally and subject's composite description and artist's

conception is being displayed among the various memberships

in an effort to identify subject.

A list of all affiliated clubs of the U. S. Parachute

Association for the entire United States as well

as an index

of the members of the affiliated clubs for the states of

California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho and Arizona

have been

obtained.

This will insure control over this facet

of the investigation.

An international skydiving meet was held December 4,

1971 at Abbottsford, B.C., Canada.

* Parachutists from the Western United States and

Canada participated.

Wide distribution of the artist's

conception and composite description of subject was made

cards of parachutists who have jumped from the Elsinore

Paricenter, Inc. 433 registration cards were photographed

representing those jumpers who registered at the Elsinore

Paricenter, Inc., since 1969 and fit within the physical

description limits of 35-55 years of age, 150-190 pounds,

and five feet eight inches to six feet one inch: in height.

A systematic review of these cards is being conducted

to possibly identify subject.

Registration cards prior to 1969 do not contain

height data.

such cards, numbering approximately 18,000

date back to 1957.

On December 10, 1971, flight records for the month

of August, 1971 were photographed at the Elsinore Paricenter,

Inc.

These records contained the last names of the jumpers,

the altitude from which they jumped, and the name of the pilot

and date.

A review of these flight records December 14-15, 1971

revealed the last names on these records match 31 individuals

whose descriptions match those of subject and who jumped from

the Elsinore Paricenter during the month of August, 1971.

Sixteen of the individuals whose cards were photographed

were

eliminated as possible suspects by interviews. The remaining

15 possible suspects are being systematically reviewed in an

effort to identify the subject.

stated basically the same

information as pro-

vided in his letter to U.S. Senator HENRY M. JACKSON. This

information is in essence as follows:

Minneapolis to Seattle, on Monday, September 13, 1971.

ero a go one pan laterainer, Montred to proximately

8:00 a.I.

This person is hereafter referred

as "the pilot."

The pilot got off the plane to stretch at

Great Falls and upon returning to his seat for the flight

to Missoula, Montana,

and the pilot struck up a

conversation. While flying over the Great Falls area,

asked the pilot if he knew the identity of any of

the buildings below them.

The pilot identified many of the

buildings, indicating that he had flown over the area many

times in the past.

In addition the pilot toldl

requirements for landing an aircraft at a field such as

that required in Great Falls, Montana.

Through conversation

it was obvious to

that the pilot was familiar with

both Missoula and Great Falls airports.

then asked

about the aircraft which was a 127 and asked the pilot if

there was a built-in skid that hit the ground every time

on the take-off which produced a characteristic noise. The

pilot then responded, no, that the noise heard was the

landing wheels being brought up at the exact moment when

the pilot begins his climb. This led to a discussion of

the 727 aircraft.

asked if the pilot had everi! flown a 727 at

which time

the pilot stated that he had piloted a 727

had made "numerous low-level flights for the military

dropping personnel

and supplies in places that were other-

wise inaccessible."

responded "something like that" (indicating no).

When these four men came aboard, one woman seated on

stated that one of the individuals mumbled something

like "We're paratroopers"

but the wording at this point was

incoherent.

Whatever was said satisfied the man and woman

who both apologized.

The pilot took two of these men forward

and said that he could arrange for two of them to sit up

front with him (the pilot).

The other two men sat in the

rear of the plane.

One of the individuals who went forward

looked a great deal

Incomplete details of our conversation regarding hijacking::

1.. "We"', of the pllot,, probably referred to an entire

crew jumping in practice.. A co-pilot,, navigator,, jump master

(1f jumpers carried) 'and a cargo master.. Probably a very

cohesive crew..

2.. The landing field,, if Sandpoint, Ida, was approached

across

gorge not far from end of runway,.

3.. The collar of the tall suspect, (headless horseman

costume) 'was six Inches wide in rear, but tapered to about

3 inches in front,, and was tined with a brown jur..

4..C%I.A. connection- almost certain li he flew outside

the continental U.S.. Saturday Revlew of Jan.. I,, 1972,, In

an article on the Pentagon papers,, page 25,, end of paragraph 2::

"Later,,,Lansdale describes in a brief passage CIA"s "proprietary"

Civil Air Transport., TO the innocent world this company was

the National Airline of Talwan.!"

The "bilot' s''experience. is probably listed China Alrlings..

And where would a 727 operating out of Talwan drop

"personnel" probably Mainland China.

5.. Where could $200,000 be changed on the black

market,, by some one with proper credentials?: Taiwan,, Hongkong

or Manila?? Where a CIA--China Alrlines pilot could have mat

black markat operators?"

China AIrlines operates out of San. Francisco to Honolulu

Wed.,, Frl.,, and Sun., at 1:15 p.I.,, and on to Talpol and

Hongkong.. The airline is probably: so small that every pilot

would probably know every other pilot... And would there be

a Ilfetime pass for an old trusted employee??

with an. old friend without being on the manifest?"

a ted for

Pan At operate flights out of portland now every night-at to Howaa

6:40 p.l.

China Airlines operates flights iron honolulu

Mon,, Tues.,, Thurs., and Sat at 1:15 pom., for Talwan..

6.. The pilot's clothes were expensive.. The closest

weave: I could spot in: Nordstrom Best's were $ 205 and $ 215..

The faint off-white

yellow shirts start at $ 22.50) If that

faint single thread were actually a Hongkong weave of a gold
