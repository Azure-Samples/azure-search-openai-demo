Enclosed for each office is one artist's conception

of the captioned subject.

The Bureau is preparing a circular

for field-wide circularization concerning captioned case and

will include an artist's conception of the hijacker. The Bureau

has been asked to prepare a sketch showing the unknown subject

without glasses:

Additional distribution will be made from

time to time to parachute clubs, flight instruction schools and

airports, etc., in an effort to identify the unknown subject

which undoubtedly will result in various field divisions receiving

calls on this case.

For the assistance of all offices in conducting

investigation and to evaluate complaints from citizens, the

following information is furnished:

The unknown subject boarded captioned flight at

Portland, Oregon, using the name DAN COOPER. As the plane

was taxiing toward the runway, Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved for the stewardesses on the right

side of the plane and behind the last row of passenger seats.

The unknown

subject, who occupied the center seat in the last

row of three seats,

turned and handed her an envelopel

which she did not open for a few minutes until he glanced

at her several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said: "Miss - I have a bomb here

and I would like you to sit by me." At this point Stewardess

then called the pilot on the intercom.

Stewardess

then sat next to the hijacker

who opened a black attache case and showed her what he said

was a bomb. She described the contents of the attache

as a bundle of red sticks, which she believed was dynamite.

the bundle consisted of six or eight red colored sticks

approximately six to eight inches long with no writing on the

outside.

The hijacker was holding in his hand a wire which

lead to the bundle of sticks and indicated that he could

detonate the bomb by touching the wire to a contact. Also in

the attache case was a cylindrical shaped battery about eight

-.-.+

At first the hijacker asked for $200,000 and two

parachutes.

After

left her stewardess seat and gave

the note to

sat beside the hijacker who, after

showing the

contents of the attache case, told her to,

"Take this down."

From her purse she obtained a pen and note

pad and he dictated the following message:

"I want $200,000 by 5:00 PM in cash. Put

it in a knapsack. I want two back parachutes and two

front parachutes. When we land, I want a fuel truck ready

to refuel. No funny stuff, or I'll do the job."

At the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac)

in answer to his demands, the hijacker was provided with the

four parachutes and $200,000 in 20 dollar bills in a canvas

bank bag. When the plane landed at Seattle at 5:45 PM (PDT)

he instructed Stewardess I

..Jto go after the money

which she did. He opened the bag; inspected the money and then

told them that the passengers as well"

as the two other

stewardesses could leave the plane. They did deplane. The

remaining crew members were the three male members of the

flight crew as well as

then made several trips out of the

plane to obtain the parachutes which she brought to the subject.

The hijacker instructed that he be flown to Mexico

City and also told the pilot that he wanted the plane flown at

not more than 10,000 feet with the flaps at 15 degrees, the landing

gear down and the rear steps of the plane also down.

The

plane involved was a Boeing 727, a Tri-jet with stairs at

hijacker.

Within minutes after take off at 7:36 PM, the

hijacker had the stewardess show him how to lower the steps.

and he then ordered her to go to the first class section

which she did, and she then continued on to the cabin.

At 8:05 PM the captain was in touch with the

hijacker by the intercom. This was the last communication

he had with the hijacker.

Just prior to this communication,

the captain had

a signal indicating that the stairs had been

lowered.

At 8:12' PM, the captain experienced "oscillation"

in the plane and thought perhaps the hijacker had departed

the plane.

Air Force fighter planes were escorting the craft

but because the 727 was flying at 170 knots, the fighter jets

were too fast.

Further, the weather was overcast and

visibility extremely low.

When the plane arrived at Reno, the hijacker was

gone and two of the parachutes were still in the airplane.

The attache case also was not in the plane and has not been

Shortly after 3:00 poll. Pacific Standard Time (PST)

11/24/71, a lone white male traveling from Portland, Oregon, to

Seattle, Washington, on captioned flight displayed the contents of

his brief case to a stewardess

indicating to her it was a bomb

which would be exploded unless his demands were met. The hijacker

indicated his willingness to exchange the safety of the 36 passen-

gers and crew for $200,000 in cash and four parachutes. He

instructed that the plane circle the Seattle airport until his

demands were met at which time the plane landed. Once the money

and parachutes were loaded and the plane was being refueled, the

hijacker allowed the passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane leaving a flight crew of three males and one female and

the hijacker aboard. The hijacker indicated a desire to fly to

Mexico City and instructed the plane to take off flying at a low

altitude and slow speed, maintaining a southerly direction. Upon

demand the hijacker was instructed on lowering the rear passenger

door while the aircraft was in flight. He was last seen in the

close the curtains behind her.

Stewardess complied, going through

first class section into pilot's cockpit and locking door behind her.

Prior to departing fron passenger cabin, hijacker told stewardess

the money bag was not in accordance with instructions and to cut

up one of the parachutes to rewrap the money, which was done. When

the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, for refueling, the hijacker,

two parachutes, the ransom money, and the vinyl brief case had

disappeared.

Investigation determined that the hijacker had purchased

his ticket at the Portland Airport shortly before the plane's departure.

Upon arrival at Seattle, all passengers were accounted for except a

white male using the same Dan Cooper.

There were no sky marshals

/"HUACK MONEY SERIAL

NUMBERS DISTRIBUTED

A list of the serial numbers of the $20 bills re-

ceived as ransom by the hijacker'of a Northwest

Airlines jetliner last month has been distributed to

all local banks and financial institutions, the FBI

announced here yesterday.

The list has been distributed nation-wide in

hopes of recovering some of the bills and identi-

fying the hijacker,

Robert W. Evans, special

agent in charge of

the San Diego Division of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation said yesterday..

Anyone who believes he may have one of the

bills should contact the local FBI office, he said.

"We're hoping that anyone who sees a large'

quantity of $20 bills, for instance, with someone

opening a large bank account with the bills, will

call us,

," Evans said

The hijacker received $200,00b, all in $20 bills, in

Seattle, Wash., before hijacking the plane

and -

parachuting from it en route to Reno, Nev.

None of the bilis have been recovered, Evans

said.

THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boasted Northwest tent Flint # vate te tight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his brief case contained a bomb:

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety. of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions.

After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

(Boeing. 727) to beepened during the flight.

recounted what happened next in a recent telephone

interview.

"I think he wanted to get out of the plane as soon as

it took off, as soon as the plane was high enough to

jump," he, said.

"But he

had trouble getting the

steirway open. He had to get Tina to help him. Then he

was looking out in the dark, the wind blowing like Billy

Hell. It took a lot of time to work up his guts.

It took 35 minutes, in fact, for Cooper to depart the

craft.

According to Brown, Coffelt recounted to him that as

he descended the rear staircase in cold, blinding rain

turbulence jolted the plane and pitched him off before

he could sight a beacon marking the location of a

waiting partner.

Coffelt talked of tumbling through the stormy sky,

trying frantically to open a faulty parachute on his

back, then dropping the money as he grabbed for a

chute on his chest, Brown said.

Himmelsbach said one of the four chutes was sewn

up and given to the hijacker by accident. He denied

the faulty chute was designed to foil the

hijacker,

emphasizing that authorities had feared

Cooper planned to take a hostage with him.

"We don't have the right to sentence someone to

death," the retired agent said

'Coffelt told Brown he craghed to the ground in a

canyon miles from his planned landing spot, severely

find the loot

Himmelsbach said years of searching for Dan Cooper

- who mistakenly was dubbed D.B. when a reporter

wrote a story using hearsay information from police —

have convinced him Cooper was "a loser, an ex-con who

was reaching the end of his string."

The description fits Coffelt, who was born in Joplin,

Mo., in 1916, raised in Picher, Okla., sentenced to

reformatory when he was 15, winding up in federal

penitentiaries in Atlanta and Leavenworth.

and on afterward.

robert. Hoyt, a Lawrence resident and technica

vriter for the CIA, said he knew Coffelt for year

"Jack was full of stories, some of which were true

and some of which weren't." Hovt said. "Sometimes he

had stories about the FBI. I don't know that he was

ever seriously involved with them, but they knew every

time he came to town."

and flashed FBI

to both

Brown and Hoyt.

In Portland, FBI agent Dorwin Schreuder said that

he had "heard of Coffelt's alleged participation" in the

hijacking through Brown's work but when asked,

whether Coffelt ever had worked for the agency, he

replied, "The FBI never comments on the use of its

informants one way or another."

Reached in Hawaii, where her husband died of a

heart attack in 1976, Tave Coffelt refused to discuss his

past.

Robert L. Dobbs, a Meriphis attorney who had

represented Jack Coffelt, said the ex-con had claimed

to do undercover work for the FBI. He said Coffelt
