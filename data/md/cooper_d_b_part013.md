BUfile 164-2111

On 11/30/71, the Bureau sent out a new artist's

conception without glasses and requested we show it to

witnesses.

Subsequently I called

in Division 6,

and told him witnesses

aid not

see subject's eyes; they saw him only with

the dark glasses.

I told him with regard to witness

that this witness

thought the eyes were "good."

This witness still maintains

however, that the forehead should be slightly broader; the

nose around the nostrils should be broadened and the cheeks

were to flat and

should be made rounder.

requested that we send him a teletype

on this and also forward the artist's conception in which out

witness had drawn in his suggested changes. This was done.

threw the following out for our guidance,

instruction and consideration:

1. He said in our initial teletype, page 5, we

have one witness saying that the subject carried a dark colored

attache case and a paper bag 4"x12"x18"

He wonders if this

paper bag could have contained a jump suit and a pair of boots.

In the same teletype, there was mention that a

witness scuffled yith the subject.

I told him that I had

already discussed this with the Agents involved and this was

a wrong

choice of words and that the word should have been

"hassel" and that there was actually no scuffle and the

witness had not had to separate the two, but merely stepped in

to end an argument.

I told him that we had used only law enforcement

kind of territory you could lay off in a grid and search

minutely at arm's length.

He said to include in our next

teletype something about the terrain.

4. He also said to include in our next teletype

Do 3 he dron are weathe conditions in the drop area at the times

the drop occurred.

He also wanted to know if we had given

consideration to hiring a professional parachutist or make

simulated drop with a dummy and following it to the ground. AL

He wondered if anything could be gained by such a maneuver

I pointed out to him that anything we did by way of

simulating the conditions would be a very broad approximation

since we didn't know exactly where the plane was, assuming

that the hijacker did go out at 8:12 PM, when they felt the

"oscillation"

Since this would vary with such factors as

wind direction; which side of the flyway the plane happened

to be on at the

time,

He said he understands this but

he would like us

think about it.

On 12/2/71, SAL

Case Agent at

Antips he sale tonal information concer Northwesssible

adjustment to the search area.

On 12/2/71,

advised that the hijacked

airplane was being flown on automatic pilot during most of

the time it was in flight over the State of Washington and

on down south.

advised that because it was automatic pilot

the crew might not be able to detect a change in the attitude

of the flight caused by a 180-pound man parachuting from the

back stairway. However, he advised that he is examining the

flight recorder with a microscope which he expects will

reveal "little bobs"

or anomalies where the automatic pilot

has mechanically made an adjustment to maintain the level

flight of the aircraft.

He noted that there was a "little bob" at approximately

8:09 p.m. and based on that finding and the fact that the

air stairs had gone down sometime earlier,

suggested

that the search area probably should be extended to the north

an additional three miles and to the south as far as the

Columbia River.

These extensions of the search area would be

RE: SUSPECT

REX SHRODER called From the Bureau and referred to

this teletype From Cleveland to several offices on this

suspect.

He said it was their thinking at the Bureau that

if this suspect was a good one, that we shouldn't have to

to have all this collateral investigation conducted until we

had shown the photo.

I told him that I agreed with him and He suggested

we call Phoenix, Portland and Butte and tell them not to

conduct their interviews until further advised by Seattle.

SHRODER also said if we got any kind of a break

on this case, we should be sure and tell the Bureau so that

they could prepare a national press release even before

we file on anybody. I told him we would.

I called Phoemix and talked to the relief superviso

on the #2 Desk; to VINCE MC CARTHY at Butte and ASAC RUEHL

at Portland and told them not to cover the lead in the

above mentioned teletype until further advised by Seattle.

ASAC BIBLER telephonically contacted the Las Vegas Office

located and searched and the Minneapolis Office also was

contacted to determine where the plane is now located so

that a search can be made of those compartments in the event

they have not already been searched either by the fBi at

called to suggest that there might be some possibility that a

radio receiver was in the hijacker's attache case. This could be

used in conjunction with a low frequency transmitter on the

ground - to know when to drop. He said this would put one within

a 3 mile radius from a 10,000 foot level jump on target.

However, he noted too, that any transisterized receiver in use

should be reflected in the

to be thoroughly re-interviewed since she feels

she can now

recall things which she did not furnish previously. They are

going to do this

in the morning.

He said that she told him that the subject told her

he wanted to take off with the ladder down, the gear down

and "we'll be flying with 15 decrees." She said the pilot

told her to tell him that they could not take off with the

ladder down and he muttered, "Yes you can, but that's alright,

we can tower It later."

told us he thought this was significant

since this would indicate the subject knew a lot about

airplanes, perhaps that he might have worked on the 727

at one time.

he also thought it was significant that "we'll

be flying with 15 degrees" since this is pilot talk, meaning

15 degrees of flaps.

I asked him if

mentioned whether

or not the subject gave instructions as to the course to fly.

He said that the subject did not, that he did not give

any neadings, he did not outline any course, but simply said

to take him to Mexico.

They will be reinterviewing her tomorrow and

furnish a teletype.
