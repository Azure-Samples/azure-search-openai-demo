advised that he found the beach area

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers.

These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge)

layer, and below that an older sand layer.

The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money. This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other deoris, which were not severely damaged or rusted.

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dredge) sand was a mix-

of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size. Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the columbia

River at this

site in 1974,L

stated this clay layer

older

sands, which were light in color and uniform in texture

and which were found below the clay lump sand, were deposited

prior to the 1974 dredging.

Jadvised that in the post dredging

layer, he found cross bedded course and medium sand, which in-

dicated the river and river waves had worked repeatedly on this

layer since 1974.

The upper six inches to eight inches of re-

worked

beach sand is the active layer which is currently being

worked by the water of the Columbia River.

Based on the condition of the money through observation,

Jadvised that the money was probably washed into

the location where it was found by natural river flow and was

-

probably placed at

the location of Tena Bar during the last

Iise in the Columbia River in the past two or three months.

She also recalled he alwas talked at a low modulation as

he had an adversity towards loud noise.

She added, she talks loud

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Maze, she will contact

In conclusion she stated in her judgment, the composite

complexion was even more tan than the complexion depicted in the

Richard A. Armstrong, Bickel Trailor Court, who

being made aware of the identity of the interviewing agent

and the nature of the interview, advised as follows:

Armstrong stated that he has had a continuing

interest in the D.

B. Cooper affair since its occurrence

because of the newsmedia conjecture that Cooper possibily

was a parachutist and that he had been a paratrooper. He said

that the fact of his being a former paratrooper and his

resemblance to the artist conception of Cooper has brought

comments from fellow constructionworkers, such as,

"Armstrong,

are you sure you are not Cooper?".

the interviewing agent

advised Armstrong that he was there as a result of an anonymous

phone caller, Armstrong said, "oh, the caller was probably

my ex-mother-in-law!".

Armstrong commented about a recent article in the

Parkersburg Newspaper which told of pieces of the extortion

money being found.

He said it was probably placed there as

"decoy". He asked the interviewing agent if the federal Bureau

of Investigation (FBI) had obtained fingerprints of Cooper

and if the FBI were certain that Cooper had actually parachuted,

instead of hiding himself on the plane.

Also, when the mechanics

of the alleged jump were discussed, Armstrong

stated that the

Jump was certainly possible, that the speed of the plane and the

altitude of it would be no factor.

He said that he, as a

United States Army Paratrooper, had made 30 jumps; one jump,

according to him, was made from a plane flying at

300 miles

per hour.

skyjacked Northwest Orient Flight Number 305 on November 24, 1971.

judgment, the black and white artist's composite without the

sunglasses looks just like

John Scott

Maze, who died of a heart attack in November, 1974, in Scottsdale,

Arizona, at the age of 59.

She

noted in addition

to the information she furnished

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Charlottesville, Virginia,

on April 11, 1980,

John Scott Maze did

smoke cigarettes of the

filter type but she could not recall the brand.

She also noted he was always extremely polite, even to

her whom he did not care for at all.

She noted the composite she identified as looking just

like John Scott Maze, looked like him without the "David Niven"

type mustache he always wore.

She also recalled he alwas talked at a low modulation as

he had an adversity towards loud noise.

She added, she talks loud

and that was one of the things Maze did not like about her.

advised she has papers and photographs stored away

and if she locates anything which would be of further value to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning Maze, she will contact

the interviewing Agent and furnish it to him.

In conclusion she stated in her juâgment, the composite

picture she identified is a picture of John Scott Maze, and Maze's

complexion was even more tan than the complexion depicted in the

colored composites when she last saw Maze in person in 1972.

Jadvised that he found the beach area

b6

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer, and below that an older sand layer. The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money.

This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were not severely damaged or rusted. The

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dredge) sand was a mix-

ture of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size. Based on U.S. Corps

The following outline is the result of many hours of research

by

and we be- f

live that this information will lead to the arrest and conviction

of "Dan B. Cooper", and the return of the money taken.

Dan B. Coopers "ILLUSIONS"

A. The public and the FBI believe the following:

I. On November 24, 1971 Northwest Orient flight 305 left

Washington DC for Portland Oregon, then Seattle Washington,

2. Shortly before landing in Seattle a note was given to

a stewardess to relay the following information to the pilot

a. I have a bomb in my briefcase:

b. Do the following: Relay I will exchange all 36 passengers

for $200,000 in twenty dollar bills, and 4 parachutes.

3. All the passengers, plus 2 stewardesses were released in

exchange for the above.

1. Money and chutes on board, Cooper positively identified

as being on board the aircraft - Aircraft now lifts off.

a. 8 fighter jets now tail the aircraft at slow speed, with

the door in the tail section of the aircraft open, all the way

to Reno Nevada.

1. All the fighter pilots report that no one left the aircraft

b. The aircraft now lands, FBI agents and police engulf the

aircraft and are convinced that Cooper did not get off the aircraft

in Reno Nevada.

c. Lodigicol assumption is to assume that Cooper had to

parachut off the aircraft batween Seattle and Reno Nevada.

1. The search now starts for Coopers body, and the money.

a. everyone is throughly convinced that mr. Cooper is

without a doubt dead.

b. 5 years later still no evidence to indicate that Cooper

had indeed jumped. The money is still missing. Not one of the $20

dollar bills has ever turned up in circulation.

d. Cooper is now made a national hero, the public, and the FBI

are still stumped as to the whereabouts of Cooper or the money.

The following information has been abbreviated to indicate our

main findings.

A. Flight 305 starts as a routine flight from Washington DC to

Portland, then Seattle.

1. Mr. X dressed as himself now leaves DC for Seattle.

3. Mr, or Mrs. Y upon arrival in Portland departs the aircraft

with the portland passengers, even though his ticket. axually reads

to Seattle.

b. Mr: or MrsX now changes clothing, and now is ready to re

board the aircraft as a ticketed passenger known as Mr. Dan Cooper.

2. Just prior to touchdown Mr. Dan Cooper hands the stewardess

a note indicating her to have the pilot to do the following:

A.I have a bonb in my briefcase have the pilot relay the following:

1. I will exchange all the passengers aboard for $200,000

and h parachutes.

2. The return message came that we will follow your instruc-

tions as indicated if you release the passengers first.

B. Passengers were now released au asked to do, in good faith.

DB Cooper-31422

## Page 93

I. Before the passengers were released off the aircraft the following

took place as scheduled.

a. Cooper now changes back into his origional clothing of Mr. X.

I. A crewmember, most likely the 2nd officer puts on the clothing

that Cooper originally had on, to complete the second part of Cooper.

2. 35 passengers, plus Mr. or Mrs. X and 2 stewardesses now de-

part the aircraft, all of these people probably state that they saw

Cooper on board the aircraft. (Actually they must have been convinced

that the 2nd officer was Cooper at this point.)

3. Actually you have 2 people playing themselves, and Cooper.

Mr. X plays himself, then Cooper until the plane lifts off, upon

which he resumes his real idenity, creating the illusion that there

are 5 people on the aircraft upon take off, when in reality only

• 4 are indeed aboard.

3. Money and chutes are now put upon the aircraft, and the flight

now lifts off for Reno Nevada.

1. 8 fighter Jets, now trail the aircraft all the way to Reno.

1. The aircraft flys at slow speed, and low with the door in

the tail open to create the illusion that Cooper would indeed jumpout.

•B. On the aircraft 4 cremembers, not 5 - because there was no Cooper-

complete the following:

1. All the evidence aboard the aircraft must be destroyed.

a. The dummy chutes, $200,000, and any other evidence is now

all. burned. YES I SAID THAT THEY DID INDEED BURN EVERY LAST 20

DOLLAR BILL OF THE $200,000. -THE ILLUSION IS NOW COMPLETE- NO COOPER,

NO MONEY, NOCHUTES, NO EVIDENCE ARRIVES IN RENO NEVADA. -

I. Upon touchdown in Reno the fighterpilots now state that Cooper

did not jump, and that nothing left that aircraft.

DB Cooper-31423

---

## Page 94

2. The FBI and police now engulf the aircraft, certain that Mr .

Cooper is aboard. After a through search of the aircraft, and crew,

they are convinced that Mr. Cooper had indeed jumped without them

detecting his jump.

THE GREATESI MADIGICAL PERFORMANCE EVER HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETED,

WITH THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AUDINCE -THE WHOLE WORLD.

I. The crew of this aircraft were nothing but actors that were

probably paid very well to put on this fine performance.

2. You must realize that the money was not the motive in this

fine madigical feat, the money was no more than a mere stage prop

that had to be burned to complete this fine series of illusions.

3. This shows you something about our Mr. or Mrs, Cooper. Cooper

has to be a very well to do person, such as an actor, or magician.

4. In 5 years the FBI has been trying to find some evidence to

indicate that Mr. Cooper jumped, and in 5 years they have not been

able to prove this fact, no body, parachutes, or money has ever

been found.

The above information has been presented to you to be notorized

and signed

to represent the research

that

have concluded, that in our opinions

may lead to the arrest and conviction of Mr. or Mrs. Dan B. Cooper,

'and accomplices. Therefore Mr. X also known as Dan B. Cooper, has his

name on the passenger list in the FBI files, and we have been denied

permission. to look at this list by the FBI.

It therefore is not possible

Might I suggest, if you have a serial number you

to contact your local sheriff's office on

Dear Sir:

This is in reference to a picture and story in the National Enquirer

this week on a man known as D.B.Cooper skyjacker. You probably receive

hundreds of letters from people who saw a resemblance to someone.

Have no reason to think or suspect the man, the picture made me

think of, he is not extra tall, he might be 6ft ( mediun hgt) in his

early fifties (probably) in good physical condition, looks youthful,

in a mature way. He was

As you can see, I do not know him on a close basis, I wouldn't have

I Feel it unfair

to name him unless you consider it important. I have no reason whatsoever

to thick he would be involved in any criminal action. I showed the pieure

to

and he thought it looked Like I

when he was young,

I don't kaow way I am writing this, I sure don't want to cause

trouble, however the thing is haunting me.

Dear Person:

I read the skyjacker story on page two of the

November 25, 1975 1ssue of "The National Enquirer,"

the

information through my private computer.

The read-out 1s as follows; THERE WAS NO PROBLEM:

WITH 196 MPH SPEED, 7 DEGREES BELOW ZERO TEMPERATURE,

AND UP TO 50 MPH WINDS. D. B. DID NOT MAKE THE

INDICATED PARACHUTE JUMP. THE CREW MEMBERS LIED.

THE CREW MEMBERS AND D. B. WERE CO-CONSPIRATORS.

Sincerely.

about 35 years of age, and slighty, or a little more so, biad bald, is enjoying the holidays

his leisure with his accomplice, a very attractive ted-headed woman of about the same age

aat has a miniature sized dog as a pet. (A check of the passenger list at the time of the hi-

You will find the two depraved and mad outlaws about four and one half miles in

Dear

Thank you for your letter expressing an interest

in locating the missing $20 bills obtained by the hijacker,

"D. B. Cooper" on Thanksgiving eve, 1971.

Due to the linited supply of ransom lists and the

great demand for them, it is impractical as well as inpossible

to nake copies of this list available to the public. However,

if you feel you might have

one of the $20 bills, you can call

your local police ur sheriff's office and check the serial

number against their list. In addition, many banking instí-

cutions throughout the country have a copy of the ransom

list.

For your information, in addition to the $1,000

reward being offered by the Oregon Journal newspaper in

Portland, Oregon, there is a reward of $25,000 being offered

for the ranson money by Northwest Orient Airlines.

Thank you again for your interest in this matter.

Thank you for your expression of interest in locating some of the

missing

$20 bills obtained by the hijacker "D. B. Cooper" on

Thanksgiving Eve, 1971.

There were

10,000 bills given to the hijacker after all of the

serial numbers had been recorded by the FBI. The Journal is in

the process of reproducing those serial numbers in installments

over several days so that readers may check bills in their possession

against the iist.,

The newspaper's publication of the list started on Thursday, Feb, 22,

1973.

If it is impractical for you to see copies of the newspaper, may we

suggest that you inquire at the closest FBI office to you whether

you may obtain of inspect a copy of the FBI's official list. The

telephone number of your nearest FBI OFFICE i susually found

in the inside cover of your telephone book.

If you do discover that you have

one of the missing bills,

The Journal will pay you $1,000 for it if it is the first one

to be turned in.

Good luck.

Thans you for your letter expressing interest in

locating the missing $20 bills obtained by the bijacker,

"D. B. Cooper", on Thanksgiving eve, 1971.

Due to the limited supply of ransom lists and

the great demand for them, it is impractical as well as

impossible to make copies

public.

of this list available to the

However, if you feel you might have one of the

$20 bills, you can call your local police or sheriff's

office and check the serial nunbers against their list.

In addition, many banking institutions throughout the

country have a copy of the ransom list.

For your information there is a reward of $25,000

for the ransom money and an additional $1,000 for the first

Dear Sir;

December 27, 1972

Sus R

I think of the D. B. Cooper case off and on

I've bren wondering for some time. if anyone in Woodland mentioned

the "Mystery Plane" article that appeared in our weekly Woodland News

paper on July 29, 1971. It was put In by the Woodland Police Chief,

Joe Mays.

I would send the ciloping except, I don't have that paper. I

looked it up at our Library so I could buy a back copy, but by that

time the paper office was on vacation until after New Years.

To me the Mystery Plane article was food for thought.

D. B. Cooper or whoever, could not have been unfamiliar with this

area, prior to the Hijacking.

This Mystery Plane bugged Woodland. for a weels and according to Joe

Mays, was the same plane that dropped Bubble gum on the school ground

in the Spring. All this and still no one could read the numbers of the

plane to report it. After the above article appeared in the paper, no

one saw the plane again, that I know of.

told me to keep my nose out of this, so until this in-

formation proves helpful or not, I will continue to sign as,

He noticed no fresh tracks near the shelter

or cache at

the time.

He was unable to look into the shelter to see what

was contained therein and he didnot remove any of the logs to

examine it.

He did notice a duffel bag hanging from a tree

near by.

This duffel bag had the name

or the last name could be

with Air Force number

J imprinted on the

duffel bag.

The bag appeared to be

old and contained numerous tears and wear holes.

He examined

the contents of the duffel bag and discovered that it contained

rifle bullets, long-handled men's underwear, shoe grease, candles,

which appeared to handmade.

had price tags on them reilecting that they were purchased

either at GI Joe's or Andy

Box both of which are Army sur-

plus stores located in Portland, Oregon. He did not recall any '

dates of purchase.

He also noted that there was a left-handed bow, as

used by archers, hanging from a tree nearby.

He removed

this

bow and took it with him, the bow bears the name Baer Archery

Company, Grayling, Michigan, registration number

He stated that the area of the cache is located in

what is known as Hell's Canyon, near the boundary between east-

ern Oregon and Idaho. It is located

generally in a gully be-

tween Windy Ridge and the next ridge

located to the southwest.

He states that

the nearest community is in Innaha, Oregon,

located on the

Imnaha River.

To get to the area you take the

Hat Point Road out of Imnaha and follow it to the end of the

pavement, at this point you follow the wide trail that goes out

on Windy

Ridge and

finally comes to a dead end.

The road ends

at a small draw and

the area of the cache is located about 200

or so yards from the end of the road.

He stated that this general area has the appearance

of being used during the summer months by packtrain trips com-

ing from various dude ranches in the area and located nearby

is a camping area which might be an overnight stopping point

on these packtrain trips.

He stated that from this camping

area the site of the cache is perhaps 100 to 150 yards away

up the side of a hill in heavy brush.

ed out by one of the rangers from the nearby ranger station at

Agency concerning captioned matter. Mr. WEINZ indicated

He recently

saw an article in the Seattle Times, which indicated that the

Air Transport Association of America would pay up to $250,000

for information laading to the arrest and conviction of

persons comnitting airborne crimes.

Mr. WEINZ indicated

that he is a businessman and felt that he could furnish some

information concerning this hijacking if the reward was

high enough.

Mr. WEINZ indicated that an individual he has known

for several years, came to his home in Mount Vernon several

weeks before the hijacking.

He indicated that he and friends

were going to pull

a big deal with á take of $200,000. He

said it would be the greatest news event in the northwest and

would make all of the papers.

His partner remained outside in

the car while WEINZ spoke with his friend.

Mr. WEING said he

would furnish no other information until he was told how much

reward he would get.

On May 10, 1972, SA CHARLES E. FARRELL was contacted

by the writer regarding the above information.

He indicated

that the reward for infornation leading to the arrest and

conviction of the subject is $5,000.

On May 11, 1972, Mr. VERNER WEINZ was again contacted

at his home in Mount Vernon by the writer.

He immediately

inquired as

to the amount of the reward and was given a figure

of $5,000. Mr. WEINZ laughed and said he would furnish the

information for no less athan $50,000 and would have to have

a majority of that amount in his possession before he would

furnish any names.

The friend indicated that a big deal had been

set

up two weeks prior, but was cancelled because ofbed veather.

He said there were three individuals involved

and they needed

one none.

He indicated that one partner had backed out of the

deal, and they needed a replacement.

The friend indicated the

group would make $200,000 and that this would be the bingest

deal ever pulled in the northwest. As he left, he said."You

will read

about this in all of the papers."

He gave no

and never mentioned airplanes on hijackinr. He stayed at the

home approximately 1 1/2 hours, but said nothing specific about

the type of job he had planned.

On a previous contact the

friend asked WEINZ if he would ever consider a job outside the

WEINZ told him that he needed work and would consider

anything.

WEINZ further stated that there was a second man

waiting

for his friend in the car.

He did not get a rood look

at him, but assuned he would be the man known as "D.B. Coopen".

His Friend 1s a

large man, and in no way, fits the description

of the hijacker.

Mr. WEINZ arainstated that he would furnich no

insured of at least $50,000.

said that the more he thinks

WEINZ is a white male, American, born May 24, 1011,

On May I1, 1972, this matter was discussed with

known welle for many years and served with the sheriff'r

office at the same time as WEINZ, He indicated that WEINZ was

in the pinball machine business

for several years before the

state clamped down on the business. He has many contacts out-

side the law and has the ability to obtain information about

CriTES.

In most instances, his infomation is fairly accurate.

BOYINGTON stated that WEINZ is in desperate need of money and

would furnish infornation if even a small arount were offered

to hin.

He also stated that WEIll drinks too much at tires and

tends to becone loud and boasts. He can be a very dancerous

nan at nost times and is very strong.

Dear Sirs,

D.B. Cooper did survive his parachute jump of Nov.

23 1971 as he had survived previous parachute jumps on the Haun

landing strip three years ago. He was last month, Fab. 1972, sit-

ting in the Steam Engine Lear Bus in Nevada when it was shown on

T.V. The cameras did show inside the bus, a man wearing dark glas-

ses who did looked annoyed when the cameras swept upon him. This

man was D.B. Cooper who chose his grandfather initials, Cooper is

because his first name is Jack. Jack Linkletter has tryed to break

away fron his murderous father several times in the past starting

from the time he was about 15 when he ran away from home. As always,

he was brought back like a puppy on a leash.

Jack was an eye witness the night of the Tate murders as

was John Zweyer who was soon executed by Robert (the Zodiac killer)

after having turned down bribery by Art. Jack knows also that Diane

was thrown out of that window to shut her up because she was to ex-

pose all of the Linkletters' murders and conspiracios, The Interna-

tional White Guard who commits assassinations, bombings, infiltra-

tion of other groups, headed in this country by Art, the pushing of

narcotics for as long as she had been born by Dad, the McClellan

landing strip being used for narcotic traffic three years ago, the

demolition experts part of te Intern. White Guard who bombs banks,

Airlines etc. Diane would also have exposed a conspiracy that took

place before Sept?º1969, the Hughes book conspiracy which at this

time included only the Linkletters

the Linkletters needed

a writer to put together their fraudulent book a convince a publisher

that this sas a Hughes autobiography. The bombings and threats were

a display of force and power which meant: "We can crash any plane

you can board if you ever mention our names."

Jack Linkletter did demonstrate last Nov. that if a pilot

can board a plane carrying a bomb, he can also fly his small plane

over any area and drop bombs. How many pilots have become wealthy

within the past 25 years flying narcotics for the Linkletters who

have been deeply involved in this racket? Sif those pilots are well.

asked what he knows ahout his father's future plans for the 1972

election, who are to be bombed out of existence so a corrupted in-

dividual from Sacramento is bousted into the White House?

Without his father or lawyers being present, I think Jack

would tell while he dill can, before he is sent Diane's way.

Re: Skyjackers D.B. Cooper and 1.5. Johnson

They were Jack Lintlottor and Robert I'niletter

who didn't parachute down fron a low flying plane but did it

as it is done in Air Shows. The gaz rasi vorn by Robert did

game me the true clue, also the shoes worn by Jack who is a

pilot. A man comes down fron a low flying plane vearing a gaz

mask, a back pack which is a jet engine that can be controlled

for a very soft landing, standing up as I saw in an lir show

a few years ago.

An accomplice could have locked those items in

a wachroom to be used by the skyjacker vith naybe a gun, a sre-

nade etc. Another accomplice pick-up the skyjacker on the grounds.

The man sith the plane around the NeClollen landing strip, the

man with the helicopter near Provo Utah. Helicopter do lands

at airports where the skyjacker could have boarded a plane to

naybe N.Y. and later on return io LoA. The loot and othoritems

boing left with the helper, so if anyone vere to be caught, it

rouldn't be our suart birds who did the actual skyjacking.

Why would the Linkletters need noney that cannot

be traced to thon? to bonb here, there, to overthrow our Bovt.,

to coverup all of their nurders, to coverup their connections

with the underworld for nore than 25 years etc.......

Since last Nov. 1971, I have had the definite im-

pression that Jack Linkletter vas trying to got arrested was

reddy to toll the truth but still finds hinself trapped betreen

two nurderers, his lather and nis brother.

Dear Sir,

Reference: My letter of February 24, 1972, Suuject: "D. B. Cooper."

Appatently Mr. "D, B. Couper" is still at large. Perhaps my .

first letter was ignured asa'witchhunt. "

Granted, my interest is

in a reward.

My limited knowledge of this person all points to a

perfect "D.' B. Cooper."

I have retouched a "D. B. Cooper" composite picture to more

closely resemble my suspect. A reproduction of this picture is

shown below.

If you haven't made any headway in your investigation, my I

suggest that you photograph various views of this man and record his

voice at calm and anger moods.

Then the plane passengers. and crew

who are available could either identify or exoperete him.

I remember the following additional infomation about him:

He had been in the merchant marine. He was treated at the Public

Health Hopsital, located at 15th Avenue and Lake Street, San

Francisco, Califomia for liver or kidney operation, Perhaps they

told him he has only a limited future.

He has a yellowish

completion and usually a grim expression.

Re: Skyjacker

Ho dofinitoly is Jack Linklottor who loss than

two wecks before was in Woodland Hille

b7C

Your artist drawing is very accurato becauso

this is oxactly the way ho looked without toupee, same glasses

and thick brown makeup to mako his complexion olive. Also I thought -

he had on the tip of his nose a plastic band to givo that pinchod

look. However the makoup didn't cover the warts noar his nose and

mouth.

Although he says he never will be caught, he wants

to be found, wanted me to recognize him by the composito drawing.

He says he never had a spooding ticket, he has not driven a car

for several yoars now, does ride a motorcyclo and fly a plano.

The McClellans and Haun landing strips are well known to him. His

sister Diano did mention three days before her death that these

landing stripe wore used for narcotic traffic, also there was

a death connected which would have been over two years ago. What

Jack is doing in running away from two cold-blooded murderers, his

father Art and his brother Robert. He Jack, was booby-trappod to

away where they wore parked, probably in shock. Was with then for the

next two days. Diane Linklotter was a witness by phone that night be-

fore the telophone lines wore cut, her brother-in-law John Zweyer was

sent by Art's wifo to help because there had to be a very good logical

explanation. Ho, John was parked in this area with his lights off till

2.30 that night, saw Robert on the grounds, also taking a rope to the

Tate residence, saw Jack sitting with his head in his hands... John was

executed three weeks later after having turned down bribery by Art. Ro-

bort did the shooting, was waiting for him in the patio, made it look

liko suicide. They had waitod for Jack to be on his way to Hawaii so

he wouldn't question the suicide story. Diane met with tho same fate,

she was guardod for the last two daya of her life, would have exposed

them.

Jack also know that it was Bt. Ohta from Soquel gho had pres-

cribed tho glasses Robert lost at the Tate residence the night of the

murders. Dr. Ohta and his family also his secretary were executed last

October 1970. Another man was usod by Robert and was just convicted

and sentenced to death. No Linkletter is ever arrested in Calif. where

they secm to havo absolute control over our law enforcent agencies.

14 more monthe to live means that he belioves that another

administration will take over in Jan, 1973 which will bring about the

Linkletter's downfall, Jack will find himsolf a witness against his

fathor and brothor, somothing he wants no part of. However in the mann-

time, he would like to keep alive. He and his wife needs protection.

She wanted to report him missing the night of the Tate murders because

she feared his father and brother might kill him if he tried to stop

them. Art's wife took control saging no one should call the Police,

The next day, John Zweyer

told her that to report Jack missing vill cause all three to be caught

Jack along with the two others, Art and Robert who are psycho-killers.

The father of Art Linkletter was Desire Belanger. This is

where D.B. comes from. Cooper? Because his first name is Jack. The 10

letters at the bottom of the letter mailed to L.A.Times with numbers,

do match the 10 letters in the Linkletter's name. I read a message

Q Question

A Art

2753 is in connection with murders since the Tate murders of Aug 1969

I understand the letter mailed to Seattle had different letters and No.

If I knew what they were, maybe I could decode them.

If he is in the area of Seattle and you can round him up,

give him this message from me. I don't believe, he, his wife and

children should be sacrificed so two cold-blooded murderers remain

free to keep on killing. I can testify for him behind closed doors

or in open court. All. I have to do is repeat what his sister Diane

was saying three dys before her death while taking a beating from her

brother Robert.
