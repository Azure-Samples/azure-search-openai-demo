Dear Sir:

I have no further information regarding the

individual described in your bulletin.

I offer for your consideration the use of a

small radio transmitter which could be placed

in a parachute or other equipment requested

in the future by such a hi-jacker, that could

be used for subsequent

tracking and triangula-

I am thinking of a similar device used

by the Air Force and I believe it is referred

to as."SARA" which transmits a fixed radio

frequency at certain intervals, and is used

to find downed air craft and/or survivors.

I realize this would be of no value in the cur-

rent investigation, but offer it for future

reference.

Sincerely,

Than's you very much for forwarding me the

information you recelved from

,, Oregon, She pointed out the similarity

in appearanco between fugitive murder suspect

John Emil List of Vestfiold, New Jarsey and the

artist's conception of the individual who hijacked

tho Forchocat Airlines 727 on Hovenbor 24, 1971.

For your information the FBI is conducting an

investigation to locato List under the Fugitive Felon

Act and a review of our file indicates that Ilst's

description approximates that of the hijacker as to

ago, height and weight.

You can be sure that the lead

you gave us will be checked out thoroughly.

When this caso is finally solved it will probably

be through the interest and cooporation of concernod

citizens such as you. Again let no thank you for

your information.

SPECIAL NOTICE FROM THE FBI

RE: HIJACKING OF NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES PLANE

ON NOVEMBER 24, 1971, BETWEEN PORTLAND, OREGON

AND SEATTLE WASHINGTON

The hijacker extorted $200,000 from Northwest Orient Airlines

at the time he hijacked the aircraft and all the money was

paid in $20 Federal Reserve Notes. Serial numbers of the

currency have been recorded.

There is a good possibility the hijacker deposited part

of the money to a bank account or paid off a debt in

$20 denominations.

Co-operation of all banks is urgently needed, and it is

requested the FBI be immediately notified in the event large

deposits of twenties are received or large payoffs are made

in twenties.

A list of the serial numbers has been distributed to many

banks in the State of Oregon, but if your bank does not have

a copy, please contact the FBI, telephone 224-4181/ Portland

Office, to check out any questionable bills.

Re: UNKNOWN SUBJECT WHO HIJACKED NORTHWEST ORIENT

24, 1971.

Enclosed for your office is an artist's sketch

and on the back of the sketch a description of the

individual who hijacked the Northwest Orient Airlines

aircraft on November 24, 1971.

The hijacker is very possibly a person who has

disappeared from his usual abode and possibly from his job.

Your assistance is requested in identifying persons who

have been missing since about the time the hijacking occurred

and who could fit the description of this individual.

I would gretly appreciate your furnishing

information regarding persons known to your agency who

have been missing recently and who could be considered

suspects in this case.

In the event you have no pertinent information as

to missing persons, please reply on this communication

stating a check of your records was negative. It is our

desire to receive a response from all to whom this letter

is sent.

CONSIDER UNKNOWN SUBJECT ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

Thank you for your assistance.

Enclosed are three copies of the newsletter we send to all

We wish to thank you for the stories you have given us, and

we hope we may be of further service in the future.

given us is hereby returned.

Again, many thanks for your help.

PORTLAND - The Annual Five-Minute

Speech Contest sponsored by Chapter 37

of the American Savings and Loan Insti-

tute will be held January 27 at the Imper-

ial Hotel, 400 S.W. Broadway.

If you are interested in swapping five

minutes of speaking time for the oppor-

tunity to win an all expense paid trip to

Atlanta, Georgia, then this is your chance!

According to Russ Allemang, Chairman

of the Contest, "Seven persons have signed

up already, but the deadline is nearing and

contestants should contact us right away

if they have not signed up."

The contest is open to all men and wo-

men under the age of 36 who are either

personally or through their own Savings

and Loan Association a member of the

American Savings and Loan Institute.

The winner of Oregon competition in

January will have all expenses paid in

other state winners. The winner of this

national competition, and only the winner,

Following the convention, other speak-

ing engagements may be planned depend-

ing on time and availability. One thing is

certain. By winning the national contest,

the speaker assures himself or herself of a

return trip to the National Convention in

1973 to give his or her speech again before

the complete convention.

include Ron Spence (Portland Federal),

land Federal),

Bill Terry (Pacific First

Federal), Dave Hodge (Equitable).

This is "the" opportunity of all oppor-

tunities for the "stout of heart" who wish

to let others know what they think. Re-

member, speakers will have five minutes,

and according to the rules ... those min-

utes are to be "uninterrupted."

Why don't you become a winner by

just competing? The experience is worth

it. Be a winner!

TELEPHONE

FORUM WELL

WORTH TIME

PORTLAND - Evelyn Kelsaw, Instruc-

tor for Pacific Northwest Bell, gave a

delightful Forum at Equitable on Tele

phone Etiquette on December 16 for mem-

bers of five Savings and Loan Associations

The Forum, sponsored by the Oregon

Chapter of the American Savings and Loan

Institute, highlighted ways in which people

misuse the telephone and the calling party

without even realizing it. This point was

evidenced by a film titled "How to Lose

a Customer, Without Even Trying."

The film showed how a firm lost an

important customer through improper

handling of the telephone and messages,

and gave tips on how these bad cireum-

stances could have been avoided if hand-

led properly.

It was felt by those in attendance that

the contents of

this

particular

Forum

should be made available to all Savings and

Loan personnel.

As a point of interest to Training Super-

visors and Personnel

Directors,

Pacific

Northwest Bell holds classes free of charge

on each first and third Wednesday of the

month from 10 - 11:30 a.m. These classes

are on different phases of telephone use

and telephone etiquette and are held at

421 S.W. Oak, Portland, in Room 401.

If interested call one week in advance

to make reservations for your personnel.

The room holds 40 persons.

COSTS GOING UP

SALEM - All Loan Departments of

Savings and Loan Associations in the State

of Oregon will be affected by new legisla-

tion increasing recording and filing fees.

The new law goes into effect on Jan-

uary 1, 1972, and includes increases in

other areas, such as circuit court and dis-

trict court fees.

The original bill was

sponsored by the Association of Oregon

Counties, and was submitted to offset the

annual cost of living increase.

According to Jim Callas of the Multno-

mah County Department of Records and

Elections,

"This is the first increase in

recording and filing fees in almost twenty

years."

The new rates for Multnomah County
