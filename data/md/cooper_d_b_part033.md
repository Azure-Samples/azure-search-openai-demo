Unsub may have made a trial run prior to NORJAK to

perfect his skyjack plan, therefore, leads were set out on

7423/73 to determine the

teasibillts o1 obtaining passenger

lists

for all Northwest Orient Airline flights.from Portland

to Seattle during the period 11/10/71 to 11/23/71. If passenger

lists of flights from Portland to Seattle for above described

period can be obtined, then names on this list would be com-

pared to NORJAK indices and other lists currently on file at

seattle, in order to possibly identify Unsub.

Prior to the 1973 hunting season which began in

October in the Pacific Northwest, information was disseminated

concerning this matter to all Washington State Game Wardens

responsible for the area to which Unsub parachuted. The Game

Wardens are currently making this information available to

all hunters

they encounter in this area.

AS 01 11/23/73, 10

positive results have been obtained.

The information being

made available

to the hunters is as

Seattle, Washington

October 1, 197.3

Dear Sir:

On November 24, 1971, a man parachuted into the be-

low described area with $200,000 in $20 bills.

If, while

camping or hunting, you should discover any evidence con-

cerning this skyjacking please contact the nearest FBI Office.

AREA INVOLVED

Bound on the west by Us 5, bound on the south by the

Columbia River, bound on the north by the Kalama River, and

bound on the east by the Skamania - Clark County Line.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR

I) The rèmains of a man, possibly dead for two years.

2)

The remnants of a parachute, harness or parachute

shroud lines.

3)

10

,000 $20 bills wrapped in a parachute canopy,

all serial numbers are known and can be identified.

4)

Deteriorated raincoat or overcoat.

5)

Small briefcase or attache case.

REWARD

$25,000.00 total or 15% of any lesser portion of the

ransom money that is returned has been offered by Northwest

SE 164-81

On the premise that Unsub parachuted successfully

into the previously calculated area of Southwest Washington,

it is speculated he would have buried the ransom money and

his parachute and then hiked to the nearest road or highway.

From there, he would most probably have walked to the nearest

phone to call a friend or relative for the purpose of being

picked up.

Since all the homes in the drop area were checked

and no strangers were reported in the area on 11/24-25/71,

all the pay phones surrounding the calculated drop area

within reasonable walking distance (ie 15 miles) were checked

for long distance phone calls; long distance is the only

type of call which records can be obtained). A list was

compiled of the numbers called from the pay phones on 11/24/71

and 11/25/71.

The records are not time correlated, however, based

on the fact that the weather was cold and rainy during

period and the styjacker jumped at approximately 8:11 PM on

11/24/71, more significance can be placed on calls made during

the end of the day on 11/24/71 or during the beginning of the

day on 11/25/71.

The names of all subscrisers called during the

above-mentioned time period were checked against NORJAK

indices with negative results.

The Seattle file review currently in progress at

Seattle continues.

The purpose of this review

' is to determine

if any new information of lead value can be developed.

review consists of an intensive serial by serial, subject by

subject analyzation.

This file review, which commenced 8/3/72, has

accomplished the following:

An intensive investigation has been conducted

of the Boeing personnel involved in the 727 air stairs test

with negative results.

2. A new color sketch has been made and disseminated.

The purpose of the change to color was to shown Unsub's age and

complexion more accurately.

Information concerning this matter has been

made available to hunters during the 1972 and 1973 hunting

seasons.

All results to date have been negative, however, the

remains

to NORJAK,

A reward of 15% of any ransom money returned or

825.000.00 total reward has been obtained through contact with

of Northwest Orient Airlines

Feasibility of cunducting an aerial surveillance

of the NORJAK flight pattern to locate any articles discarded

by Unsub prior to jumping was investigated. This type search

was determined not to be feasible.

6. A more accurate method of plotting of radar data

of the NORJAK flight using a computer was utilized and a new

search area was plotted. This new search area was searched with

negative results.

A review was conducted of the magazine and news-

paper articles written just prior to NORJAK in an attempt to

develop information concerning how Unsub conceived his hijack

plan.

It was learned that approximarely 12 days prior to

NORJAK, the first skyjacking involving a parachute was attempted.

this skyjacking was given a great deal of publicity at

that time, it is felt Unsub may have used this event to help

him formulate his skyjacking plans.

SMALL TOWN OVER ON THE SEATTLE OR TACOMA SIDE OF THE INLET. THE WAY IT WAS ROBBED KEEPS

WORKING ON MY MIND, AND PROMPTED ME TO WRITE THIS LETTER.

AS I REMEMBER THE BANK CASE, THE ROBBER TUNNELED UNDER THE BANK BLDG FROM

A HILL SIDE, ABOUT 300FEET IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, HE TRIN BLEW THE VAULT AND GOT AWAY

WITH QUITE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY, HE THEN GOT CAUGHT BY THE F.B.I. BY PASSING THE MONEY'

I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU TRIED THE CASE AND WOULD REMEMBER THE NAME, HE WOULD PROBALLY HAVE

Dear

Thank you for your letter expressing an interest

in locating the missing

$20 bills obtained by the hijacker,

"D. B. Cooper" on Thanksgiving eve, 1971.

Due to the limited supply of ranson lists and the

greai demand for then, it is impractical as well as impossible

to make copies of this list available to the public. However,

if you feel you might have one of the $20 bills, you can call

your local police vi sheriff's office and check

the serial

nunber against their list.

In addition, many banking insti-

tutions througlou: the country have a copy of the ransom

list.

For your information, in addition to the $1,000

reward being offered by the Oregon Journal newspaper in

Portland, Oregon, there is a reward of $25,000 being offered

for the ranson money by Northwest Orient Airlines.

Thank you again for your interest in this matter.

Dear

Thank you for your letter expressing interest in

locating the nissing $20 bills obtained by the hijacker,

"D. B. Cooper", on Thankssiving ove, 1971.

Due to the limited supply of ransom lists and

the great demand for them, it is impractical as well as

inpossible to nake copies of this list available to the

public.

However, if you feel you might have one of the

$20 bills, you can call your local police or sheriff's

oifice and

check the serial numbers against their list.

In addition, many banking institutions throughout the

country have a copy of the ransom list.

for your iniormation there 1s a reward of $25,000

for the ranson noney and an additional 51,000 for the first

missing $20 bill turned in to the Oregon Journal newspaper

in Fortland, Oregon.

Thank you again for your interest in this natier.

sincerely,

Based on the above, it would not appear he should be

unusual activities and

the results of recent extensive invest

Dear

Attached is correspondence indicating a solution to the

D.B. Cooper case, giving details for the location and ap-

prehension of the culprits involved, and the procedures

to obtain our $200,000.00.

Judging from this letter you can see that our president

is plagued with all kinds of cranks. Yet we will keep

accepting any information regarding this particular case

in the hope that sometime a piece of information will be

received that is factual and could aid in the solving of

this case.

As indicated, I do not believe there is any valid information

in the letter, but nonetheless we will pass it on to your

department so that you may further investigate it. No

stone should be left unturned in an attempt to solve this

crime.

At your convenience, please advise us what your evaluation

of this letter is.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and may you have

a successful New Year.

ar Sir;

Whether you believe the following information, and how I came to obtain it is a

atter for you to decide. By rejecting the information, you are still minus $250,000 and a

niac that has motivated hijacking and mass murdering aboard Airlines.

I am in no way affiliated with EVIL, or the hijacker "D.B. Cooper." I am a man of

a. For the time being, we will let it stand, and get to the point.

"D.B. Cooper" ordered the aircraft to circle SEA-TAC airport, as you well know.

ou also know,

although it is not general public information, that a tape recorder had been

ound that had been issuing orders to the pilot long after "Cooper" jumped. What you do not know

out God knows) is WHBRE he jumped, and the disposition of the money. His letter to you sometime

1 accomplice, whom I will reveal a little later. "Cooper" as you have suspected, is a "fire

When the aircraft circled around above Sea-Tac Airport, "Cooper" bailed out,

aving the recorder running with directions, etc. He planned the jump so that the wind was

I have shared this information with the F.B.I. and also the Secret Service. Both

it you think? The Secret SErvice is

so secret, I wonder if they know what is real? But that is

side the point. It is just exasperation upon my part, so forgive me my ravings, will you?

Now to the meat of the subject, as I told the above "secúrity" organizations:

know the exact whereabouts of "D.B. Cooper"

and his accomplice, and also the EXACT SPOT that

olds the money hidden from the human eye. I will go a little further and say that Cooper, who

s about 35 years of age, and slighty, or a little more so, xx bald, is enjoying the holidays

ack, and the memory of one of the stewardesses will reveal this to you.) First things first!

you will lind the two depraved and mad outlaws about four and one hall miles in

s a dirt road on the east side of lake Kachess, which is, by the way, a dead end road. When you

ave captured them, and as God, even Jehovah the Father, is my witness, you WILL capture them,

ad the maximum penalty of DEATH is too good for them, you will then contact me at the above

idress, and I will lead you to the ransom money. I have tried several times to recover it, but

now know why I have been unable to. "Cooper" left the very unstable plastic explosives in the

g with the money, and only a qualifted disposal man should handle it. when the bag is recover

Re

Seattle memo of SAl

I INSUP: Tama Bank Robbery:

On 1/22/74,

Shelton, Wa., advised he had no specific

Information concerning the possible identity of unsub in this

matter, also known as n. B. COOPER.

He explained that he merely

recalled recently a bank burglary which occurred in the early

1960's in some

small town located between Seattle and Tacoma,

in which the individual responsible for the burglary had tun-

neled into the bank and had made away with some $75,00n in

He added that the individual had to use explosives

entrance to the bank and as best he could recall, this in-

dividual was also believed to have been employed with United

Airlines at the time of the burglary,

He stated he could not

recall the subject's name nor could he recall the date or 10-

cation of the bank burglary,

and he had no other reason for

thinking that this individual might be the unsub in this matter,

other than the fact that it occurred to him that this bank

burglar must have been

a very smart individual as he believed

unsub, aka D. B. COOPEP. must have been, and also, since he

recalled he was employed with United Airlines, he would have a

knowledge of the air transportation industry.

Istated that possibly he could locate the news-

paper article concerning this bank burglary which was the source

of his information, as it was written up in the Shelton Journal

which is only a weekly newspaper.

He stated that he would re-

contact the FBI

should he be able to obtain any additional in-

formation.

Dear Mr. Kelly:

Thank you for the recent copy of the extortion note

in the Trans World Airlines aircraft bombing case.

It is

my understanding other communications from the offender

were received by telephone and transcribed in the offender's

own words. Would it be possible to have copies of those

phone messages that dealt with such matters as the locations

at see it s

lof explosives, leasing and dispatch of STOL aircraft, etc.?

Undoubtedly valuable psycholinguistic clues would be. involved

in these instructions. Is it possible any of these calls

were tape recorded?

I appreciate this opportunity for informal association.

Sincerely,

MONTGOMERY stated he used to live in Dallas

and was in an accident approximately & year ago from which

he outained $60,000 insurance money, and that seems to

explain the money that MONTGOMERY apparently is spending.

The complexion of MONTGOLERY is fair.

Due to the above, no further investigation will

be conducted concerning suspect MONTGOMELY at this time.
