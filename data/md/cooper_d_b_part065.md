above mentioned.

Jalso asked if the entire course of the

flight had been searched.

He was advised that the pertinent

part of the State of Washington as well as all of oregon,

and Nevada, had been checked but apparently the area in

California had not yet been searched due to the fact that the

reconnaissance plane had been unable to fly the course due

to bad weather.

advised that Sacramento should be

immediately

contacted and requested to do a thorough search

of the area, the same to be handled within the bounds of good

judgment.

he asked was, -

Did the UNSUB use the lavatory he

wondered whether he might have taken the money in there to

check it.

He was advised he used the lavatory before the

He said it seemed to him

that Portland had set out a lot of unnecessary

to get a photo of the suspect and have it shown to

3. He wanted to know if we had considered

having a Northwest plane fly Agents over the exact course at

night so that we could look down and see just what the

situation was when the "bump" occurred at 8:10 or 8:12 PM.

was that there was no way of duplicating the conditions

RE: SEARCH AREA

A facsimile copy of a memo prepared by

accompanied by a map,

which is also a facsimile, were re-

ceived at 6:05 PM, 12/4/71, from Minneapolis.

The map shows the course of the aircraft from

slightly north of the Kelso-Longview area to just south

of Battle Ground and sets out the most likely area for the

parachute drop according toL

_ latest

calculations as an area described by paralel lines C, D E & F.

Generally speaking this would be an area between Pidgeon springs

and an area just north and east of Hoodland.

The above information was furnished on 12/6/71

by ASAC BIBLER to SA MANNING at which time SA MANNING

advised that he is sure that the area now described has

already been searched by helicopter and fixed wing aircraft and

that much of it has been covered on the ground as well.

instruction and consideration:

1. He said in our initial teletype, page 5, we

have one witness saying that the subject carried a dark colored

attache case and a paper bag 4"x12"x18".

He wonders if this

paper bag could have contained a jump suit and a pair of boots.

In the same teletype, there was mention that a

witness scuffled with the subject.

I told him that I had

already discussed this with the Agents involved and this was

a wrong choice of words and that the word should have beer

"hassel" and that there was actually no scuffle and the

witness had not had to separate the two, but merely stepped in

to end an argument.

called twice on the afternoon of November 28, 1971. The

first time he advised that he had checked on possible

information and believed that a more accurate pin-pointing

of the possible place of descent of the hijacker would be

three statute miles east northeast of LaCenter, Hashington,

on a bearing of 080 degrees, true.

He said the center of

the circle would depend on the clock being a few seconds

off one way or the other or the Unsub falling free before

he opened the chute.

However, he would estimate that a

circle with a three-mile radius from the point described

above should come close to the place of descent.

He called back subsequently and said that he had

talked to the man who was working the radar at Portland

which was very accurate since it was very close to the

plane at the time and determined that the plane was actually

nearest at he tele toes one on o

This information was furnished to SA MANNING on

November 28, 1971. He was instructed to make certain that

this area was thoroughly searched and to consider air

coverage on November 29, 1971.

On December 1, 1988, the Vancouver office of the

BI was telephonically

Bo was telephonically contacted by

Jof Camas, Washington

_stated that on

the night of the hijacking he had been listening to his televisio

and had followed their account of the incident as it unfolded.

He stated that shortly after the takeoff from Seattle Airport

he went outside his residence and watched for low flying aircraft.

He stated that sometime after the takeoff he heard

a aircraft

flying very low over his residence and then cross the Columbia

River and continue heading in a southerly direction.

went on to explain that the aircraft flying south from the

Seattle Airport routinely flew directly over his property in

the Camas/Washougal area of Washington.

He feels that because

of the flight path of the airplane it may be possible that

Mr. D.B. COOPER had parachuted

in the Columbia River adjacent to his residence.

He felt that

this would explain the money being discovered sometime later

down river. I

concern was that the search for

subject's body in the Columbia River has been taking place

too far west, he feels that it should be conducted in an area

which would be in direct line, if you were to draw

a line on

the map, from Renton, Washington through Ariel, Washington down

a location in Camas, Washington.

Geologist's finding

contradicts theory

By Bud Alay

The Dally News

A thorough search of a Columbia River beach where part of D.B.

Cooper's ransom money was found Sunday has turned up no new

clues as to the fate of the legendary skyjacker.

The FBI said today that the search will continue today and Frie

day, then probably be suspended temporarily.

Broughi to the beach to aid in Wednesday's search were af

backhoe and a geologist.

The FBI said the backhoe was used to dig a trench near the

discovery site, making possible a study of the layers to sand.

An associate professor of geology at Portland State University,

Leonard Palmer, was retained to inspect the sand and to assist in-

vestigators in determining when the bundled money may have been

deposited there.

Palmer, to the surprise of some authorities, concluded that the

money was deposited on the beach in the past year or two because i

was above clay deposits put on the beach in a 1974 channel dredging

operation.

According to the F81, a coarse layer of sand sloped from a height

of about six inches at the river's edge to two feet or more some

'distance up the river bank.

/Barlier, Ralph Himmelsbach, a Portland FBI agent who has had

charge of following new leads in the Cooper case for a number of -

I years, said he believed the money must have been deposited within

a couple of years after the skyjacking.

He says discovery of the money provided a major break in the

case, but puts authorities no closer to locating Cooper, whom Him-

melsbach believes is dead.

Agents say the money was tied to Cooper when he bailed out'of!

the plane, but was no longer with him when it was deposited on the!

beach.

If it had still been attached to his body at the bottom of the river"

when the channel was dredged in 1971, the body would have clogged

up the dredge and have been found, agents believe.

Jack Pringle, assistant agent in charge of the Seattle FBI Office,

told The Daily News this morning that small bits and picces of $20

bilts were located Wednesday when agents continued digging in

sand surrounding the spot where a Vancouver family discovered

money Sunday.

The Harold Dwayne Ingram family was on an outing north and

west of Vancouver when their &-year-old son, Brian, uncovered

#several thousand dollars in decomposed bills.

Ingram contacted the Portland FBI Office, and a check of serial

numbers conclusively established that the money was part off.

$200,000 in $20 bills Cooper had When he balled out of a Northwest,

Orient Airlines jet over the Lewis River area on Nov. 24, 1971.

Pringle said the area was still being searched today, but no new

evidence had been located as of this forenoon.

"Some of the area is inaccessible, and there's no way we can

search the whole area," Pringle said in Seattle this morning

groan

By Donna duBeth

The Dally News

The handful of residents who live along the beach

where part of D.B. Cooper's Icot was found Surday

are kicking themselves for not building more sand

They also wonder whether they should have paid

more attention to the sand dredging operations along

Tina Bar is a stretch

of sandy beach on the

Washington side of the Columbia River northwest of

Vancouver. The lonely country road that winds along

the beach, Lower River Road, dead-ends about three

miles irom where a Vancouver family found about

$3,000 beneath the sand Sunday while on a picnic.

Rabbits bounce on the side of the road at night, starti-

• ed by occasional passing cars.

Less than 10 houses are along the 12-mile stretch of

beach road. Most of the land belongs to large dairy

farms. The Fazio Bros. Sand Co. also fronts the river.

A road leading through the Fazio gate is a popular

path to the beach. It is the same path used by the

family the day they found the money. On the east side

of Fazio Bros. is Leeward Isle Marina, with a public

fishing boat launch and one or two house boats.

During fishing season, the beach is packed from

‹ end to end, say locat residents Clarence and Barbara

Ellis. They have lived in their mobile home just down

the road from Fazio Bros. for the past 30 years.

Every day Clarence takes his outboard skift along

"Tina Bar patrolling tne river and the beach for

renegade logs that could damage other boats.

Ellis says that the Army Corps of Engineers con-

linuously dredges sand directly off the shore from

most of it's been destroyed by the dredging,"' he said.'

• "Even the FBI is going to be able to figure that one

out."

Today a spokesman for the Army Engincers said i

they were working closely with the FBI, checking out

that lead. The sand sucked up from the bottom of the

river and spewed onto the beach could have contain-

ed some or all of the long-sought money. While the

dredging is continuous,

the last time sand was

deposited in that spot was in October 1074.

Another resident of the area said that the money

was found too far from the water to have washed up.

"It had to be the dredging. Maybe I'll go get me a

shovel," said Mrs. J.W. Freeman.

The FBI dug all day Tuesday, finding bits and

pieces of 520 bills. An agent guarding the site Tuesday

evening said the amount they found during. the day

was less than the $3,000 orginally dug up.

Tuesday night the Eilis family sat in their home

decorated with fishing gear and large plants, amazed

that some the D.3. Cooper money was showing up on

the same beach their children grew up on.

"To think I worked like a slave all my life and here

this money was right in my front yard," said Ellis.

"When I think of the times my kids took the four-

wheel drive right over that spot. I mean that's our

beach. It belongs to the people we lease from and

that's the beach we use."

His wife, Barbara, said she felt "kinda sick" not

finding it. But she added that she would have turned it

in. "Somebody could have lost it," she said.

The beach property actually belongs to the Hang

Egger family of Vancouver. A baby sitter at the home

said the Eggers were on vacation in California. Thes

learned the money had been found on their property;

How it all

started

On Nov. 24, 1971, a

calm,

man

calling

himself Dan Cooper bought a

ticket for a Northwest Airlines

flight to Seattle.

Shortly

after takeoff,

he

handed a note to stewardess

Florence Schaffner.

Thinking the man was try-

ing to "hustle" her, she stuff-

ed the note in her purse, but he

motioned for her to read it.

The note

said he had a

bomb, and wanted to go to

Mexico.

While the jet circled Seattle

before landing, the skyjacker

also ordered that $200,000 cash

and four parachutes be

brought to the plane.

The

airline

agreed, 36

passengers and part of the

crew were allowed to leave,

and the plane took off with the

,man and his ransom.

As it flew south,

lowered,

and

minutes later

reacted in a manner that con-

vinced the crew that the sky-

jacker had bailed

the

Lewis

River-Lake Merwin area east

of Woodiand.

Thus began the legend of

D.B. Cooper (the name Dan

Cooper somehow got lost in

news media accounts of the in-

cident.)

Cooper has never

found, but interestin the cash;

is stiil strong, and flared Tues-

day when the FBI announced

a Vancouver family had found

ransom money on a Columbia

FBI: Cooper likely

dead man

By KERRY WEBSTER

KINT Staff Writer

It's more likely than ever that

the legendary D. B. Cooper is just a

grinning skeleton in a nylon shroud,

say FBI agents raking the sand for

the last of his mouldering stash.

"The discovery of the money

adds credence to the theory that he

probably did not survive the jump,"

said Bill Williams, a special agent

in Portland.

On the north bank of the Column-

bia River today, more than 30 FBI

agents worked behind a cordon of

armed sheriff's deputies, spading

along 150 feet of shoreline.

The site is where eight-year-old

Brian Ingram of Vancouver, digg-

ing idly in the sand with a stick on

Sunday, turned up a sodden wad of

No trace of Cooper or the hijack-

stories dedicated to the exploit.

FBI agents, who have been the

butt of D. B. Cooper jokes for nine

years, did not conceal a certain

grim satisfaction when they an-

nounced the finding of the money in

Seattle and Portland press confer-

ences yesterday.

The fact that the money appears

to have washed up on the river-

chances that Cooper is dead.

Upon cessation of the most recent terrain search in Clark

expenditure of approximately 9 weeks.

The search conducted by the United States Army was the best

effort which could be expended considering the number of personnel.

involved, logistic and support problems, weather and terrain

factors.

This is pointed out by one speaking from actual

experience,

intimately acquainted with details of the various

searches, since there

appears to have arisen some question on

the adequacy of the military searche

The searches conducted by Agent personnel were also the best

effort which could be out forth considering the same problems

mentioned above.

The most recent search appears to have been based upon the

securing of new data which corrected

the most logical spot at

which the hijacker exited from the aircraft, which resulted in

the moving

of what has been referred to in past communications

as point A.

However no concrete information has been developed

that the parachute of the hijacker did not open and the renewing

of the search of the terrain at new point A appears to have

been based on mere conjecture that the chute did not in fact

deploy.

In view of the above it is respectfully and earnestly

recommended that absent concrete information concerning the

hijacker or evidence in this matter being in the searched or

unseacrhed terrain that no further terrain searches be

undertaken.

It is felt that to do so would result in an

unwarranted expenliture of agent time and effort and an

that ent t

expenditure of Bureau funds which is not economically feasibles hE

or justified.

Further explained was the necessity for the

presence of heat which would need to be generated by the

object (attache case) in contrast to the surrounding

terrain for successful infrared high resolution photography.

The size of the attache case provides a poor target for

any type of aerial photography, including visual photography.

The following background information is being

provided to the Norfolk Division: Unsub had with him prior

to the time he jumped the following:

A. Parachute Back Pack

B. Parachutc Chest Pack

Briefcase or attache case

D. Dark overcoat

E. A 4x12x14 paper bag

F. A pair of dark slip-on shoes.

Hrap around sunglasses with dark rins.

H. 10,000 $20 bills.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly con-

tained a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case

from the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous

other itens he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to

jumping, it would fall almost directly in the path of the

aircraft.

The 727 air stairs vere lowered sometime after

7:42 p.M. and Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24,

The plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles

during this time.

would be able to provide expert information

concerning the feasibility of using high resolution infrared

on regular photographic equipnent in a low flying aircraft

to locate the attache case or any other of the above-described

items Unsub may have discarded prior to jumping.

The items could possibly be lodged in thickly

wooded, mountainous terrain.

The search area would cover

& strip of land approximately 87 miles long by one-half

mILe WidE.

It has been suggested that infrared photography

might possibly indicate non-living material, such as an

attache case, in a darker shade than living material, thereby

enabling the

photography.

case to be found using infrared high resolution

Since Unsub possibly discarded the attache case

prios to jumping, he could not have buried or hidden it.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. The

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or any

othes item is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the arca

covered is relatively small when compared to the entire

flight path.

Since NORJAK is the only aircraft hijacking in

which the subject has not been identified and apprehended

nor the ranson money recovered, the following lead is being

heavy brush, fallen timber and almost impenetrable and is

an area in which there are no residences or farm buildings.

On the County Road 32 side of the suspect area the terrain

drops very sharply about 50 feet from the road to the creek

bed.

Further on the county road 20 side of the suspect area

the terrain also drops very sharply to the creek.

Dear

I am delighted to receive your letter of

Agents in the search for the unknown hijacker of Northwest

Airlines Flight 305 in the vicinity of la Center, Washing

I had written to General Bolling earlier and am

attaching a copy of my letter to him for your information.

In addition, however, I would like to tell yoù officially,

as I have told you informally before, that we are deeply

appreciative of the assistance received from the Army and

are most favorably impressed by the performance of _

and his splendid staff.

It is a source of pride and assurance to see the

"Army perform in the magnificent manner in which they did

on this extremely difficult task.

It is a tribute to you

and to the officers under your direction, and I hope that

you will see fit to insure that appropriate records are

made of my observations concerning their performance.

Dear Mr. Milnes,

Now that the Army's participation in the search for D. E. Cooper

has been completed, I would like to express to you my appreciation

for the outstanding assistance and cooperation which you and your

agents gave to l

Jand his squadron.

It would have been

understandable had the Bureau confined its participation only to

those aspects of the search which required the presence of its

agents.

To the contrary, your agents participated to the fullest

extent, and the manner in which they did so was most impressive.

Their

willingness to share the hardships of field duty and their

cheerful cooperation in the search efforts reflects most favorably

on their professionalism and on your leadership.

On behalf of all Army members of the search force, I express my

sincere appreciation to you and all agents who took part in the

operation.

Sincerely,

RE: TELEPHONE SERVICE AT

COMMAND POST, MERWIN DAM,

(TELEPHONE NO. 225-7151)

On April 17, 1972, the writer contacted

of the General Telephone Company, Gresham,

Oregon,

which handles the telephone service at Merwin Dan

discuss the billing of the telephone installed on 3/20/72

at the Command Post at Merwin Dam.

It was explained to

that, in view of the heavy use of the phone

to make calls to

Fort Lewis, this office was interested

in exploring the possibility of having the entire billing

made as a llatts installation, retroactive to the date of

installation, if such a billing would be cheaper than

having the calls treated as long distance calls. To make

such a determination, however, the telephone company

would have to determine what the bill is at this time.

said he would request a special run of the

billing for the above number which would take some three

days as these runs are made every three days and would

telephonically contact the witer or ASAC BIBLER.

advised, however, even if the Watts line

would be cheaper he doubted if it would be made retroactive

at this date.

It also was explained tol

that we might

consider furnishing his company with a list of calis made

fron the Comnand Post to various numbers at Fort Lewis and

have separate billings made up.

On April 18, 1972, SA MANNING advised that the

Command Post at Mermin Dan would be totally deactivated

by early noon of April 18, 1972, and he was then calling

the local operator to have the telephone at the Command

Post discontinued as of close of business April,

ft. Lewis, Washington, telephone

advised that it was his intention

if FBI approval is given, to make a "low keyed response"

to the press to the effect that "we are resuming the

search in the south."

advised that, since the movement of

troops and helicopters from Ft. Lewis to the Vancouver area,

would generate press inquiries" he planned to contact the

press on his own iniative, possibly on 4/7/72, to advise them of

the above.

advised that the Department of the Army had

given its approval and felt that the previous search had

been an excellent training vehicle.

was advised that any clearance would

have to come from SAC MILNES who was unavailable at the time

and he requested that when Mt. MILNES was available that

be contacted at the above telephone numbers.

After discussing this with MI. MILNES I called

back and said that this was satisfactory.

return.

These agents will not be recalled when the search

is reneved. The agent personnel who will be reassigned to

this search will be from San Francisco and Los Angeles, instead

of Butte, Portland, etc.

I told him we had no information on when the search

is going to start again. In other words, the date has not been

set.

There is a staff neeting at Fort Lewis this morning and

it is possible they will have an answer before the Army leaves '

at noon.

However,

Thad no answer at 10:00 this

morning.

He indicated that if they return honday, this

will probably mean they will search the southern half only

but if they return on Tuesday, it will nean they will search

the entire area, with a possible commitment on the troops until

4/21/72.

At approximately 2:30 Pi our time I talked to

SA HENRY SCHUTZ from the Bureau.

SCHUTZ, requested that I be sure to get word to you

that he expects to hear from you tonight to talk over the

search situation.

lie also advised it will be necessary to get a

"good" teletype off to the Bureau tonight relative to the

discontinuance of the search for the time being. This tele-

type should generally point out that the Army has withdrawn its

troops, that the search has been arduous and physically

exhausting

and that the

troops are being withdrawn primarily

to give them some rest; also in view of the approaching

noliday weekend.

It should point out that agents have been

with the troops

throughout the search and that the agents

involved also have undergone an arduous and tiring experience

and can use rest too. It should point out that UACB

agents from the nearby offices at least will be released

to

return to their offices, and that either the same agents

or replacements for them will rejoin the search with the

Army troops at whatever time this resumption of the search

is established.

E

e

Assistant Director BATES called from Divisono. He

said that they had a call from the Public Affairs Officer

of the Army.

The Army is sending out to their Public Affairs

officers in the field certain questions and answers which they

anticipate using in connection with publicity in regard

to the search.

Question 1:

• Is the Army assisting the FBI in its

search for a sky jacker? Answer:

At the request of

the FBI approximately 200 U. S. Army troops from Ft.Lewis

are assisting in the search for a sky jacker, believed to

have parachuted in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon, on

the 24th of November 1971.

There is a possibility this

sky jacker could have died in his jump.

The Bureau suggested

to the Army ahat they change Portland to LaCenter, Washington)

Question No. 2 relates purely to the justification for

the U.S. Army, which is supposed to be defending this country,

being used in a situation like this and in answer to it the

Army saralthey

• feel it is justified since th

it came at

the request of a responsible government agency and is related

to their training program.

BATES did not give me this verbatim since we would not

be concerned with it.

Thax No. 3 is another Army question which raises

is such support legal and the Army answer is Yes.

BATES suggests that we make no comment other than to

say, Yes, the Army is assisting us in the search and we

have no further comment.

stated that on

the night of the hijacking he had been listening to his television

and had followed their account of the incident as it unfolded.

He stated that shortly after the takeoff from Seattle Airport

he went outside his residence and watched for low flying aircraft.

He stated that sometime after the takeoff he heard a aircraft

flying very low over his residence and then cross the Columbia

River and continue heading in

a southerly direction.'

went on to explain that the aircraft flying south from the

Seattle Airport routinely flew directly over his property in

the Camas/Washougal area of Washington. He feels that because

of the flight path of the airplane it may be possible that

Mr. D.B. COOPER had parachuted from

the aircraft and landed

in the Columbia River adjacent to his residence. He felt that

this would explain the money being discovered sometime later

down river.

I concern was that the search for

subject's body in the Columbia River has been taking place

too far west, he feels that it should be conducted in an area

which would be in direct line, if you were to draw a line on

the map, from Renton, Washington through Ariel, Washington down

The following background information is being

provided to the

Norfolk Division:

Unsub had with him prior

to the time he jumped the following:

A.

Parachute Back Pack

B. Parachute Chest Pack•

C.

Briefcase of attache case

D.

Dark overcoat

E.

A 4x12X14 paper bag

F.

G.

A pair of dark slip-on shoes.

Wrap around sunglasses with dark rims.

H. 10,000 $20 bills.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly con-

tained a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case

from the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous

other items he had to carry.

If he

did throw it prior to

jumping, it would fall almost directly in the path of the

aircraft.

The 127 air stairs

were lowered sometime after

7:42 p.m. and Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24,

-The plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles

during this time.

Fort Lewis, Washington, advised on August 22, 1972, that

• Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, tele-

phone

would be able to provide expert information

concerning the

feasibility of using high resolution infrared

or regular photographic equipment in a low flying aircraft

to locate the attache case or any other of the above-described

items Unsub may have discarded prior to jumping.

The items could possibly be lodged in thickly

wooded, mountainous terrain.

The search area would cover

a strip of land approximately 87 miles long by one-halt

mile wide.

It has been suggested that infrared photography

might possibly indicate non-living material, such

attache case, in a darker shade than living material, thereby

enabling the

case to be found using infrared high resolution

photography.

Since Unsub possibly discarded the attache case

prior to jumping, he could not have buried or hidden it.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. The

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or any

other item is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the area

covered is relatively small when compared to the entire

flight path.

Since NORJAK is the only aircraft hijacking in

which the subject has not been identified and apprehended

nor the ransom money recovered, the following lead is being

set forth as a method of possibly obtaining new evidence

that might identify Unsub or indicate his whereabouts:

On 1/12/72 I called ASAC ROSACK at Sacramento.

I told hin we were temporarily stimied in our search of

the area as to where the hijacker could have possibly jumped

pending decisions from them as to whether the photo

reconnaissance plane was going to photograph the arca

and read the photos for us before we tried to do a foot

search.

After checking he saidthey vere going to do it;

they had the map of the area and the first good day

when the light was right, they would do it. It would not

take long after that that the photos could be studied and

analysed, the thought it would be only a few days that

We wOuld

have the results.) He will be advised.

I called the Bureau and talked to HENRY SHUTZ.

I told him that the SAC had wanted him to know the reason

we had not come in with a request in connection with a

terrain search of the suspect drop area, was that we felt it

would be well to have an aerial reconnaissance. I furnished

him the information set out above. He said that he understood

and that it was no problem insofar as he was concerned.

Re: SEARCH AREA

I the

at

Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis.

on the results of the experimental flight on 1/6/72, coupled

with updated information furnished byl

of the U.5. Alt Force at McChord AFB, he had prepared a

revised plotting of the course of the aircraft as well as a

probable jump area.

A memo prepared by

Jas well as a map

which he also had prepared, had been received and during

the telephone conversation

Jadvised that in his

juagment, the best possible spot to search for the subject

would be at Point A and proceeding from there to Point B

on the may.

memo adequately explains the lines

drawn on the map and are therefore not further being

explained.

Isaid he feels that the hijacker is more

apt to be found south of line A & B than north of the line

and more apt to be in the western part of the possible

area than in the eastern part.

As a result of talking with

the writer drew arc's emanating from Point A down

to a

point on line G thru K.

The arc's were extended along

the

lines A-B and down to the same aforementioned line GK.

It was his feeling that this would be the most fruitful

The next choice would be a continuation of

fus. f

arc's to the north of line A-B also to line G thru k.
