At approximately

3:22 p.m., while the flight was en route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated to the stewardess that his briefcase

contained a bomb, which would blow up the plane unless his

demands wore met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safey of the 36 passengers aboard the

plane.

When the aircraft landed in Seattle, Washington,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received his. parachutes and money, the hijacker

For information of Seattle, on 5/29/79,

Lewis River News, Woodland, Washington, telephonically

contacted the Portland Office to furnish the following infor-

mation:

Since the hijacker in this matter parachuted from

the Northwest Orient airliner in the vicinity of Woodland,

Washington, his newspaper has monitored the investigation

and the readers have followed it with interest. He wondered

whether there had been any recent developments in the investi

gation, and he was advised that investigation was continuing

to identify and process logical suspects.

Jadvised that he understood there was a dis-

crepancy between the name "D. B. COOPER" by which UNSUB is

generally known and the name

"DAN COOPER" by which UNSUB was

also known.

The reason for this discrepancy, which was an

error in reporting made by an Associated Press reporter

on the.night of the hijacking, was explained to l

then advised that recently a crude homemade

gravestone

had been discovered in a Woodland cemetery.

This

gravestone was made of concrete, and had the name "D. B. COOPER"

scratched into it. The gravestone did not mark an actual grave,

and was obviously merely a prank.

The above is for information of the Seattle Division.

Dan B. Coopers "ILLUSIONS"

A. The public and the FBI believe the following:

1. On November 24, 1971 Northwest Orient flight 305 left

Washington DC for Portland Oregon, then Seattle Washington.

2. Shortly before landing in Seattle a note was given to

a stewardess to relay the following information to the pilot

a. I have a bomb in my briefcase;

D. Do the following: Relay I will exchange all 36-passengers

for $200,000 in twenty dollar bills, and 4 parachutes.

3. All the passengers, plus 2 stewardesses were released in

exchange for the above.

L. Money and chutes on board, Cooper positively identified

as being on board the aircraft - Aircraft now lifts off.

a. 8 fighter jets now tail the aircraft at slow specu, with

the door in the tail section of the aircraft open, all the way

to Reno Nevada.

• 1. All the fighter pilots report that no one left the aircraft

b. The aircraft now lands, FBI agents and police engulf the

aircraft and are convinced that Cooper did not get off the aircraft

in Reno Nevada.

Dear

Unfortunately, there remains only a limited number

It therefore is not possible

to send copies of the list to everyone requesting them.

Might 1 suggest, if you have a serial number yol

wish to check, to contact your local sheriff's office oi

bank as they should both be in possession of the ransom

list.

As you know, it is only through the cooperation

by citizens such as yourself that this crime might be

solved. Thank you for your interest in this matter.

On 12/4/74, JIM FRENCH, KVI Radio News, home telephone

746-7606 (Bellevue), telephonically advised the Seattle FBI

Office thatalthough he has not seen the composite picture of

the UNSUB in this case lately, the description provided by

this writer fits an individual who a few days ago was inter-

viewed by FRENCH to act in a radio show. This individual's

name is RUSSELL (MNU) MOHNEY, a WM, age about 35, dark brown

hair turning gray, 5'10", 170 pounds, smooth complexion but

not too dark, oval

face which tapers at chin, good voice, no

noticeable accent, and a heavy smoker. He has worked in

past for a radio station in Anchorage, exact one unknown.

FRENCH advised that one could probably find out through

KENI, Anchorage, or KFAR, Fairbanks. MOHNEY currently is a

writer for Pacific Search Magazine, which is located at 715

Harrison, Seattle, telephone 682-5044. He currently resides

in Gig Harbor, address unknown, but will be moving to Issaquah

in the very near future, as his wife is employed in that city.

FRENCH advised that he only has a "hurch" that this

person may be the UNSUB, as he is the type who would get

satisfaction from any great feat, even if he had to keep it

to himself.

ADDENDUM

FRENCH advised MOHNEY has SSAN 532-30-9193. MOHNEY is

negative in NCIC with this SSAN.

AT SIERRA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

On October 25, 1974, Sheriff SAM DOYLE Of

the Sierra County,

California, Sheriff's Office,

telephonically advised the Sacramento Division of

the FBI that some hunters in the vicinity of Sierra-

ville, California, had located some property which

he wished to bring to the attention of the FBI in

view of the skyjacking case in which an individual

known as D. B. COOPER parachuted from the craft

approximately two years ago.

DOYLE stated that the hunters found among

other things a harnass which probably was a portion

of a parachute or parachutes.

He advised that there

were other quantities of what appeared to be camping

equipment. He stated that the material found, however,

was extremely deteriorated and it appeared that it

-probably had been exposed to the elements for ten or

more years. He advised that he believed that his

Jat Loyalton, California, has

the recovered property.

On October 24, 1974,

tacted the Sacramento FBI Office.

was calling to determine if the Sierra County Sheriff's

was determined by his department that the property

could in no way have been associated with the sky

jacking connected with D. B. COOPER within the past

two or three years.

He said there were large quantities

of what appeared to be camping equipment and it was

felt that the property had been exposed to the elements

for at least ten years.

He stated that there formerly was a para-

medic training facility operating out of the Stead

Air Base near Reno, Nevada, and that trainees and

instructors from that facility often parachuted into

and trained in the Sierraville area.

He stated that he was quite certain that

the highly deteriorated property found had been left

by those trainees.

advised that after coming to

that conclusion he had disposed of the property at

the Sierraville dump.

On October 25, 1974, a physical observation

at the Sierraville dump

concluded the discarded property

could not be located.

D.B. Cooper case, giving details for the location and ap-

prehension of the culprits involved, and the procedures

to obtain our $200,000.00.

Judging from this letter you can see that. our president

is plagued with all kinds of cranks.

Yet we will keep

accepting any information regarding this particular case

• in the hope that sometime a piece of information will be

received that is factual and could aid in the solving of

this case.

As indicated, I do not believé there is any valid information

in the letter, but nonetheless we will pass it on to your

department so that you may further investigate it. No

stone should be left unturned in an attempt to solve this

crime.

At your convenience, please

advise us what your evaluation

of this letter is.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and may you have

do For the time being, we will let it stand, and get to the point...

"D.B. Cooper" ordered the aircraft to circle SEA-TAC airport, as you well. know.

u also know,

although it is not general public information, that a tape recorder had been

When the aircraft circled around above Sea-Tac Airport, "Cooper" bailed out,

aving the recorder running with directions, etc. He planned the junp so that the wind was

I have shared this information with the F.B.I. and also the Secret Service. Both

ve stupidly ignored me, although it is the duty.of

the same to check all possible angles, Hou

t you think? The Secret Sirvice is so secret, I wonder if they know what is real? But that is

side the point. It is just exasperation upon my part, so forgive me my ravings, will you?

Now to the meat of the subject, as I told the above "secarity" organizations:

know the exact whereabouts of "D.B. Cooper"

and his accomplice, and also the EXACT SPOT that

Ids the money hidden from the human eye. I will go a little further and say that Cooper, who

about 35 years of age, and slighty, or a little more so, liad bald, is enjoying the holidays

his leisure with his accomplice, a very attractive ted-headed woman of about the same age

at has a miniature sized dog as a pet. (A check'of the passenger list at the time of the hi-

ck, and the menory of one of the stewardesses will reveal this to you.) first things first!

You will find the two depraved and mad outlaws about four and one half miles in

a dirt road on the east side of like Kachess, which is, by the way, a dead end road. when yor

ve captured them, and as God, even Jehovah the Father, is my witness, you wIll capture they,

d the maxinun penalty of DIATH is too good for them, you will then contact me at the above

dress, and I will lead you to the ransom money. I have tried several times to recover it, but

now know why I have been unable to. "Cooper" left the very unstable plastic explosives in the

§ with the money, and only a qualifted disposal man should handle it. when the bag is recover.

• The bag is slightly torn and a few bills are missing, but "Ya can't win 'em all!"
