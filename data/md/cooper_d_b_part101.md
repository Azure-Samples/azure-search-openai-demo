convinced me that he was D.B Cooper was the letter written to the San Francisco Chronicle from D.B. Cooper

after the skyjacking. He signed it "From the guy that devised the system to beat the system"! Only Sheridan

Peterson would have written that statement, I guess that the FBI found Sheridan and he probably had an airtight

alibi. He would have done that as part of his "desion to beat the system", He was also very interested in Boeing

planes

My question now is what ever happened to him and does he seem to have more money than the labor type

jobs (he normally had) could have provided? I would guess that he could have written his great skyjacking novel

(as an English major) and sold it to have money for the rest of his life. Of course the novel would not be published

until he was dead.

I am a voracious reader and read an average of about ore book a week.

A majority of the books deal with literature, philosophy and commentaries

on current issues.

My favorite sports are hiking, swinning and skydivins.

un+11

the last

two years I have been a very ardent gardener.

I have written a great many short stories and poems and sare been working

on a novel for the past six years. However, I have sot found a publisher

interested to publish any of ny work.

This Man Jumps From

Airplanes for "Kicks'

Here we have a man who jumps out of airplanes for fun.

He falls at 120 miles an hour. He glides like a bird. He

blossoms out with a parachute. He lands with a bump.

He's always a little fearful before each jump, but he thinks

that's OK. His name is Sheri-

• TESTS REQUIRED

; When one wants to be a sky-

diver, one has to go through super-

vised testing period, First there's

short delays-then the delays

(from airplane to release of para-

chute) get longer. Then there are

licensing phases, And, all club

jumps are supervised by a salety

officer. Then-if the main para-

chute falls, skydivers always have

an

auxiliary one. Consequently

skydiving is quite safe, maintains

Sheridan Peterson.

So, all you seckers of "Irec-

dom," "new experience," "adven-

ture," "release"-just call Sheri-

dan Peterson at Ext. S-2234 and

sign up for the club. The minimum

age is 18; the maximum age is a

little vague-around retirement

age, Peterson comments.

There's only one minor draw.

back Il you're married, keep an

eye on your wife.

"Wives," says

Peterson, "are considered by many

to be the greatest obstacle to sky-

diving. There seems to be one way

out of

this problem-get more

women interested in the sport."

RE: SUBFILE 130'

On 2/17/72 and 3/3/72, attempts were made to

contact Rev. JAMES STOCKDALE, University Christian

Church, 4731 - 15th N.F., Seattle, Washington, with

negative results.

On 3/16/72, STOCKDALE was contacted at the

above address and furnished a handwritten note,

STOCKDALE advised he had found next to a pay telephone

in the lobby of the church on 2/2/72. STOCKDALE advised

that he had no idea who had left the note by the

telephone in the church and surmized that there was

probably no connection between the note and the actual

hijacking in question but felt that he should turn

the note over to the FBI as it appeared to have something

to do with a hijacking.

Based on the content of the note by Rev.

STOCKDALE and the manner in which it was written and

discovered it is felt that no further action should

be taken in this matter, as the note is an incoherent

and illegibly written note frow which no logical leads

of value could be obtained.

"You will recall the Northwest Airline Highjacking by a

As a result, we have

had a number of subsequent highjackings using the same

even identifying themselves as

D. B. Cooper.

There have

• been attempts by many of the news media to glamorize,

compliment and praise the actions of Mr. Cooper.

It has

gone on to a point of making him an actual "folk hero."

To me this appears to be an act of great social irrespons-

ibility on the part of several individuals.

Recently,

there has been a production of a record "D. B. Cooper,

Where Are You."

This record is a Tex Hughes Record and

is pressed on a 45 disc.

Rosult of dxamination:

It was concluded that the hand printing on Q35

and Q29 was propared by one person. It was not definitely

determined whether the hand printing on 031 was prepared by

the person preparing 035 and Q29 because of variations 1n

the limited conparable material; hovover, characteristics

were noted which indicate that Q31 was probably prepared

by the person who prepared 035 and Q29.

The typewriting on Q36 1s the same style as the

typewriting on Q30, but it was not determined whether these

spacinons wers prepared on the sane typewriter because of

the lack of significant defects.

No waterwarks; indented writing or other features

were found on Q35 and 836 which would be of value in detormining

the source of these specimens.

Dear Editor:

To the Public:

I must ask you,

Who in the hell do some of you people think you are, and what the hell

do you think you're doing.

I suceeded in pulling off one of the most successful, talked about

crines of today. Then some guy credits himself with the masterpiece and

thanks everybody, for their cooperation an hospitallty.. Well Dawn.it, this

Is making me look very stupid. These prank letters must stop....

No one was indangered, the caper was only committed to show the un-

believing world that a perfect crime was possible. (I belleve it must be

perfect since the F.B.I. are still investigating in the southern part of

Wash).

I have notified the F.B.I. asking that they grant me Amnesty.

The money will be returned.

NO HARM DONE.

Sirs,

I knew fros the start that I nouldn't be caught.

I didn't rob Northwest Orient because I thought 1t

noula be ronantlo, heroic or any of the other cupherists

that seem to attach thenselves to situstions of high

risic,

I'a no codern day Robin Hood, Unfortunately ào have

only 14 conths to llve.

My life has been one of hate, turnoll, hunger and nore

hate, this seemed to be the fastest und most profitable

way to gain a few fast arains of peaco of tina.

I don't blame people for hating re for what l've done

nor do I blaze anybody, for wanting no to be caught and

, punished, though this can never happen.

Here are sone (not all) of the things working against

the authoritles:

I'e not a boasting ran

I löft no fingerprings

nore a toupee

wore putty make-up

They could add or subtract fros the composite a hundred

times and not cono up with an accurate vescription, and

we both know 1t.

I've cose and gone on several airline flights already

and at not holed up in some obsure backwoods toun,

Neither am I a psycho-pathic killer. As a natter of

fact I've never even recelved a speeding ticket.

That's you for your attention.

Re Seattle letter 12/13/71 transmitting copy

of a letter received by the managing editor of the

SEATILE TIMES On 12/13/71, signed "D. B. COOPER."

On 12/14/71 SA

called from the

Bureau. He advised that the UPI carried an article today

concerning a letter received by the LOS ANGELES TIMES, and

wanted to know where the original of this letter could be

located since Los Angeles advised they had a copy.

I told him that the SEATTLE TIMES likewise re-

ceived a copy, as did the WASHINGTON POST and the NEW YORK

TIMES, and that we had sent a wire to Los Angeles, New

York and WPO to get the copy received by them.

While talking to SA

I called

Jat the SEATTLE TIMES, who had furnished the letter

originally and he said he had given us everything they

received.

Likely the original as still in the laus ectee

that I suspected that very

writer.
