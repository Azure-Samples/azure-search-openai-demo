UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Washington, D.C.

TO ALI LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES:

On the afternoon of November 24, 1971, a Northwest

Airlines Boeing 727, bound from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle,

Washington, was hijacked on take-off at Portland.

The hijacker who boarded at Portland, and who

threatened to detonate a bomb allegedly carried in his

briefcase, was given $200,00k in used twenty dollar bills

and four parachutes, when

the plane landed at Seattle.

All passengers and part of the crew were then permitted to

leave the plane.

The aircraft took off from Seattle, and the hijacker

is believed to have left the aircraft, using

the parachutes,

over the southwestern part of Washington State.

The hijacker has not been identified and no trace

has been found of him, the parachutes, or the money.

A composite description of the hijacker and

two photographs of an artist's conception, are set out:

where the circumstances of his disappearance would suggest

rim as possibly identical with the hijacker.

In view of the fact, that the hijacker threatened to

detonate the bomb he allegedly carried, any suspect should

be considered armed and dangerous.

Any agency having information which might assist

in identifying the hijacker, should contact the nearest
