DEAR MR. MANNING,

HAVE

SOME IDEAS ON YOUR HI-JACKER;

"MIDDLE AGED" --- HE IS A VETERAN OF FORLO WAR 11.

"ESPERIENCED PARACHUTIST" --- HE IS EITHER AN ARMY

OR AIR FORCE

VETERAN. WAS A PARATROOPER IN WHIT.

"JÚMPED OVER WILD COUNTRY AT NIGHT" --- IS FAMILIAR

WITH THE GEOGRAPHY OF THAT AREA THEREFORE PROBABLY

RESIDES THAT AREA. HAS HUNTED IN THAT AREA.

ACTION ---

CHECK ALL VF AND AMERICAN LEGION POSTS THAT

AREA, ALSO VA HOSPITALS.

"WAS GIVEN FOUR

PARACHUTES" --- WHY FOUR? FOR A

DESIRED 'SOFT'

LANDING HE WOULD NEED ONLY TWO.

CONGLUSION

-== HE HAD AN AGCOMPLICE WHO USED THE

OTHER TWO

'CHUTES (ARE YOU SURE THAT ALL THE PASSEN-

GERS GOT OFF) POSSIBLY EITHER A WOMAN OR A 'TEENAGED

BOY WHO

REMAINED HIDDEN BEHIND AND REAPPEARED AFTER

THE PLANE TOOK OFF AFTER THE CABIN DOOR WAS LOCKED,

GAVE HIM THE NECESSARY HELP THAT HE NEEDED

AND VANISHED WITH HIM.

I HOPE THAT THESE THOUGHTS ARE HELPFUL TO YOU.

" A very strange case indeed. Just a thot on the part of an outsider is following.

why could this not have been a job by part of the cre

Who saw the man to buy ticket? who took the money bag?

tho asked for the ransom?

The stewardess could have worked it out with a little help possibly.

Why did not the trailing planes see the jumper if he leit the jet as told.

It may be a wea rd idea but I believe the FBI could check that angle.

RE: D.B. COOPER

Dear Duty Agent;

I am sending this letter at the request of the Duty Agent of April 27th. I have mixed

feelings about providing this information since I am not certain that it is totally reli-

able. I also believe that the statute of limitations may have run out on this case.

In November I saw a composite drawing of D.B. Cooper on TV. At that kime I was

certain that it was someone I knew. I later talked with the individual and

learned that he had been_

_Western Airlines. I also learned that he wi

in various locations in the US including Alaska.

In January I took his photograph which is enclosed. Perhaps you can check

it against your drawings. After this length of time I am no longer certain that

the picture I saw on TV does in fact resemble the photo.

One other, very subjective, thing. Although he has been nothing but civil and

friendly with me I have observed that he has a mean disposition with little

provocation.

It you feel there is any merit in pursuing this information I will then provide

you with a name and possible location of this individual.

FBi ending hunt

for Cooper cash

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) - The search along a

¡Columbia River beach for more money from the D.B.

¿Cooper hijacking eight years ago probably will be

suspended after today, FBI officials said Thursday.

Meanwhile, a geotogist concluded that several thou-

sand dollars found. Sunday by an 8-year-old boy on a

family picnic was deposited on the beach in the past

year or two.

FBI agents continued to dig for more of the $200,000

that Cooper took with him when he bailed out of a plane

son Thanksgiving Eve in 1971.

The search began Tuesday along the river's north

#shore, about three miles southwest of downtown Vanceu-

aver. Additional scraps of money were found on Weanes.

+ day.

A man whose

passenger list was signed

"Dan

Cooper" left a Northwest Airlines plane that was bound

a for Reno, Nev., from Seattle after he displayed what

Lappeared to be a bomb and obtained a package of $20

" bills and three parachutes.

FBI agents believed he leit the plane, during a

istorm, about 20 miles northeast of where the crumbled

and weathered bills were found.

It is the nation's only unsolved hijacking.

"We'll work today and tomorrow and probably knock,

"it off and bring my troops back up here and reassess the

"situation," said Jack Pringle, assistant agent in charge

"of the Seattle office which took over the search

n operations.

"Some of the area is inaccessible.and there's no way

I we can search the whole river," Pringle said.

- He said geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State

Tniversity concluded that the dredging operation in 1971

did not put the money onto the beach, because the blils

were found above clay deposits put on the banks by the

dredge.

Brian Ingram, when scooping out a place for a

canipfire, found the. money, tied together by rubber

bands in three clumps, under a thin layer of sana.

The bills were matched to the Cooper loot by seriai

numbers.

i.d

Last November24th,

a man Identifying himself as

„ Cooper, parachutedtrom a Northwest Orient

ines. 727 jetliner between Seattle and Reno Nevada

with a parcel containing 10,000 twenty dollar bills which

was the ransom money that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattie-

Tacoma International airport.

The F.B.I, and other state and local law enforcement

agents assisted by companies of G.L's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payers dollars looking for cooper.

So far Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same Ingenious manner that he pulled off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

danger.

The F.B.I, headquaters" in Seattle has vowed to scri

utinize every loot of land between the Sea-Tac airport

and Repo to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias "

Fink o your Friends" programe thé public has generally

granted Cooper adoration and somewhat a hero status.

anosymous interviewer from the twice weekly

spaper the 'Seattle Flag' has produced a story from

a taped interview with D.B. Cooper which is validated

by the presentation of one of the recorded twenty dollar

bills included In the ransom money,

This story was run in the *Flag because the inter-

viewer was unable to send it to the 'Post-Intellingener'

because they had the 5,000 dollar reward out for Coopers

head also television stations would have requested a jape

from

which voice prints could possible be produced."

Therefore; running the story in the Flag was the only.

solution.

Cooper said that the critnesses description were off

by about lifteen pounds and a couple of inches. Also that

the artist's impression were very poor. When asked why :

we was stil in Washingion state he added that he felt

"It was safer to hide where no one would imagine him to

be rather then to go to some pince like Mexico or South

America where the authoriteswould naturally expecthim

It was a calculated risk that's why he jumped in bad

weather and at night, also he waited a little longer than

usual before pulling his ripcord.

Adding that his free

fall was about 5,000 of the total 7,000 feet. Which was very

risky doing at night.

He came down about a hundred miles away from S.W..

Washington contrary to the F.B.I, report that he touched

down near Vancouver Washington.

The first thing he did on landing was bury his chute,:

: he was within five miles of where he had intended in an

evergreen wooded terrain. He credited this accuracy

to his projected calculations and his japanese watch.

He wouldn't say whether he had an accomplice on the.

Dear Sir,

I was reading the wednesday edition of the Portland

Oregonian about the finding of the marked bills from the Cooper

highjacking and noticed the sketch of the highjacker that i hadn't

seen before.I recognized a great similarity between it and a man

i rode on a bus with from New York City to Spokane last June the 8th.

As long as we were going to same state we sat together and

he told me what he had been doing in New YORK.He had been living

in Nassay on Long Island and doing odd work to get by on. He said'

he had A sister in Spokane and was going there. When we got to Chicago

he bought my dinner and rode the rest of the way with A tourist who

was going as far as we were.

I am 68 years old and living on retirement so it does not

make any difference about the reward offer being cancelled.I am enclosi

RE: TELEPHONE SERVICE AT

On April 17, 1972, the writer contacted

of the General Telephone Company, Gresham, Oregon,

which handles the telephone service at Merwin Dan

discuss the billing of the telephone installed on 3/20/72

at the Command Post at Merin Dam. It was explained to

that, in view of the heavy use of the phone

to make calls to

Fort Lewis, this office was interested

in exploring the possibility of having the entire billing.

made as a latts installation, retroactive to the date oi

installation, if such a billing would be cheaper than

having the calls treated as long distance calls. To make

such a determination, however, the telephone company

would have to determine what the bill is at this time.

said he would request a special run of the

billing for the above number which would take some three

days as these runs are made every three days and would

telephonically contact the writer or ASAC BIBLER.

advised, however, even if the Watts line

would be cheaper he doubted if it would be made retroactive

at this date.

It also was explained to I

that we might

consider furnishing his company with a list of calls made

From the Command Post to various numbers at Fort Lewis anc

have separate billings made up.

On April 18, 1972, SA MANNING advised that the

Command Post at Merwin Dan would be totally deactivated

by early noon of April 18, 1972, and he was then calling

the local operator to have the telephone at the Command

Post discontinued as of close of business April 18, 1972

with certain expertise in this but they are of the view that

He suggested that the

military be polled to determine if they would take the

aerial pictures and what it would cost us. In addition, in

talking to them determine if it's possible for them to take

the pictures and give the film to us for developing as a

means of reducing the cost.

I told him that we had initially arranged for the

Air Force to do it.

Then when the Bureau came out with the

airtel advising that we must get the cost estimate first

and get Bureau approval before utilizing Air Force equipment

that we discontinued this effort.

However, I now find that

UTILIZATION OF MILITARY

AIRCRAFT IN BUREAU CASES

PERSONAT ATTENTION

In connection with a recent aircraft hijacking,

inquiries were made concerning the use of military aircraft to

assist in a search. The question of reimbursement was raised.

This matter has been discussed with the Department of Defense

(DOD) .

Advice has been received from DOD that: military air-

craft may be utilized for non-DOD purposes only when: (1) their

' movement is pursuant to an emergency involving imminent loss of

life; (2) is specifically authorized by statute; (3) is in

•direct support of the military mission; or (4) is certified

by

the head of a Federal department or agency to be in the national

interest and commercial transportation is not available. This

is set forth 'in Department of Defense Directive' #4500.9, dated

November 29, 1971.

...

According. to DOD, Section 686 of Title 31, U. S. Code,

• requires in every instance the DOD be reimbursed for the total

costs involved in the utilization by any other Federal agency

of any aircraft or equipment made available to such agency for

use in connection with its own investigation.

of Defense further advised should any requirements in connection

with our investigations develop which come within the above

guidelines, DOD will consider them on a case-by-case basis.

DOD furnished the hourly rates for the most commonly

used aircraft.

These rates are set forth as follows:

On 1/11/72 SA WICK, Olombia RA, was furnished with a copy of

entire area outlined by l

survey in 1968. Approximately 30 photographs give complete coverage

of the area in question and are sold at $1.25 der photo.

Further

SA WICK is securing, in addition to the photos, detailed maps made from

the photos which can be used in conjunction with the photos for

complete familiarization with the search area as it existed in 1968.

It was pointed out by the Bureau of Natural Resources that there should

be no major radical changes in the area since the last fly over..

SA WICK was advised to purchase the photographs and it is felt the

expenditure of the money for the shotos and maps will not exceed

$50 and in view of the magnitude and importance of the search is

a legitimate expenditure of Bureau funds.

The above mentioned maps are being sent to the Longview RA

it is felt that such a fly over

and the cost of such service would not exceed $50 per hour which

sum could probably be negotiated to a lower amount on a daily basis.

Facilities are available at the Longview Post Office for

mounting the photographs and maps in proper sequence to enable

personnel to be properly briefed on general terrain features and

prime search area and the civil service examining room can be made

available for such briefing.

It is to be noted that in the event interpretation of the

Based upon mans received this date at Longview RA pin pointing

a walking search to be conducted in the near future in extremely wooded

made.

Once the search date is fixed thismatter be made a Special

with the four California offices, Portland and Seattle to furnish

four or five agents to participate in the search on a volunteer

basis.

The voluntary aspect is being emphasized in view of the terrain

to be searched and the uncomfortable conditions which will undoubtedly

be experienced by the searching personnel.

It is recommended that volunteers be sought from individuals

who have some,and preferably extensive, experience in the use of a

compass and hiking and camping experience and who are physically

to spend a period of time in a densely wooded area

as essentialzy a problem similar to a military field exercise.

on what

It is further recommended that the agent personnel assigned

be cognizant of the fact that once the operation starts they will be

required to

remain overnight in their assigned searching areas rather

than retracing areas covered

to go to and from a base camp.

A list of recommended items to be secured for logistic support

of this special is being prepared by the writer the majority of

which can be secured from the Army or the Navy at little or no cost

to the Bureau..

Aerial photographs of the search area as set forth by the

map of

plus terrain maps are presently being secured

in order that the search area may be properly divided for maximum

coverage by searching agents.

It is also recommanded that this search be a completely Bureau

operation involving no outside agencies so as to limit the amount of

publicity which is generated.

It is felt that the prime and secondary search areas, while

In rough terrain, can be adequately searched by a small, select grouD

of dedicated personnel who are doing it voluntarily and

the search

will either find the hijacker or lead to the conclusion that the area

pinpointed by all available technical data has been completely combed

Dear Sirs,

Olympic Helicopters can provide valuable assistance to

you as a time saver in your investigations and search

operations. By eliminating wasted travel time for inves-

tigators and for evidence to reach your laboratories,

a chartered helicopter can result in economies far ex-

ceeding the charter cost. A helicopter can also be in-

valuable for searches or surveillance operations.

We have two types of helicopter available for your

charter.

The Hughes 300 is a small two passenger

machine that is ideal for beating the ferry schedult

congested or non-existant roads, or for searches.

cruises at 80 MPH and charters for $75 per hour.

Longer. distances and when you are in a read hurry, our

Hughes 500 turbine powered helicopter is the answer.

It carries four passengers at 140 MPH cruise for $225

per hour.

For record purposes, I called SAC WHALEY at Albuquerque

on 11/29/71, and told him I understood that there was a

research project at Hodlomal body of high altitude parachuting

Air Forcé Base in New Mexico

dealing with the effect on a

and the

effect of low temperatures on a body in case a jump

was made.

I asked him to see if he could contact the

person responsible for the survey to give us some notions about

what effect this would have on the man making this jump.

I told him that the weather was clear to 1500 feet,

broken clouds to 5,000, solid above, and that the jump was

possibly made arouna 7,000 to 10,000 ft. at a time when the

"total average temperature" was minus 7 degrees.

SA CHARLES E. FARRELL,

NORJAK

RE: REWARD

At approximately 10:15 AM, on 4/26/72, a male

who did not identify himself, telephonically contacted

the office to inquire as to any reward being offered for

the money paid in the hijack of NW Airline Flight #305.

He was informed that the POST INTELLIGENCER

has a $5,000 reward as part of their "Secret Witness"

progran.

The caller, who appeared to be a young coherent

man, said he wondered if there would be any reward

in addition to that $5,000 for the return of the money

asking whether or not insurance company's who insure such

large suns don't automatically pay a 10% reward of any

money returned.

He was advised

that if he could provide

information which would assist in identifying and locating

the hijacker that although the writer could make no

promises of any revard, it was indicated that there was a

good possibility that it would be worth more than the PIs

$5,000.

The caller stated that he had been told by a

friend whom he refused to identify that a short time after

the hijacking, this person allegedly saw a parachute in the

trees and the caller indicated that it was an area where

there was lots of snow.

The writer asked the caller if he would like to

have some help.

I asked him if I should bring a shovel.

He answered that I might need a shovel to bury the hijacker,

if he is still hanging in the trees; however, he further

refused any help.

The caller did not saw when the information was

received or from whom. Attempts were made to have him

come to the Seattle Office and give us the information

he says he possesses and let us make the search but he said

he would either check it out first himeelf, after consulting

DATE:

SAC, SEATTLE

NORJAK

On 12/20/71. I talked to SAC HELD in Minneapolis.

I told him that we had made extensive efforts to search the

area where the hijacker is believed to have jumped, without

discovering any evidence of his whereabouts

or identity.

The Northwest Airlines people here have advised

that they would be glad to simulate his flight, having'a

man jump to see whether the crew experienced the same

reaction as recorded on the initial flight, and if the

flight recorder records the same movement of the plane.

If it did not, then it would appear that there was little use

searching in the area we were searching in.

If it did have

the same reaction, then we would have to search an area

approximately 24 miles by 6 miles of virgin timber.

I told SAC HELD I thought it would be well' if

possible to have the same airplane used with the same crew

but I did not see any reason for them to actually jump in

the same area since it would be too dangerous and we may

lose the jumper, but 1 aid think it would be a good idea to

simulate it in an area where the jumper could be recovered.

He advised he had taked to Mi. NYROP about this

and that he had instructed that the crew and plane be put

together for this purpose as soon as possible.

I inquired of him the status of their proposed

offer of a reward and he advised Mr. NYROP had told him

that the Seattle P-I Secret Witness Program had announced

« 85, 00 велка,

a $5,000 reward, which was true, and that he would give

consideration to making another

$5,000 offer for information

furnished to Northwest Airlines or the FBI, furnishing the

identity of the hijacker and evidence to assist in his

conviction.

ap-

proached a stewardess with a note demanding $200,000

aud four parachutes.

He displayed a brief case that contained' severa

s. ed cylinders connected by pieces of wire.

Vhile the plane flew from Portland to Seatig

the thwest officials were notified and they began fran-

They also obtained' the parachutes from Sealtle

Skysports, Inc.

The short flight from Seattle to Portland had tak-

en a numbing 2½ hours, but the other 35 passengers

aboard the plane were unaware of the drama going on

down on the ground — or in the aircraft.

At 5:40 p.m. everything was ready and the plane

touched down at SeattIe-Facoma International Airport

five minutes later.;

Within 20 minutes, the passengers had left; the

money and parachutes were on the plane and the cab-

in crew and stewardess Tina Mucklow were hostages.

Difficulties in neling opcrations delayed the take-

off for a tense nour, but by 7:40 p.m. the jetliner was

airborne aud headed for Reno, Nev.

Somewhere in the dark night, with the' plane

flying at low speed, the cabin depressurized and the

door open, "D. B. Cooper" parachuted into the black

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS

RE: COMPUTER SUPPORT TO THE FIELD

The main thrust of our computer support effort in the past has been directed at administrative

and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) matters. It is now my desire to concentrate more on ways

our computers can support the Agent in the Field. This is to make you aware of the computer services

The Data Processing Section (DPS) of the Computer Systems Division is responsible for

working with the Field on investigative matters. Agents with specialized backgrounds have been assigned

to this Section and will assist you if some aspect of a case lends itself to computerization. This might be

a large volume of records (e-g-, checks, cash receipts, purchase orders, personnel records, payroll

records, telephone numbers, etc.) that require sequencing, comparing or calculating, to disclose

misappropriations, kiting, lapping, skimming, padding of payrolls, identities of suspects, conspiracies,

etc. If you think the work can be performed more practically on the computer, you should contact the

DPS.

The DPS also offers assistance in the following areas:

1. Printing records that are in computer form (e-6-, records on computer tapes,

disks or cards).

2. Assistance in writing search warrants for, and conducting searches of, computer

installations.

3. Assistance in writing subpoenas for computer records.

4. Assistance in auditing computer records.

5. Assistance in interviewing computer personnel (e.g., computer analysts,

programmers, operators, etc.).

6. Computerized Telephone Number File (CTNF) services which will resequence

telephone numbers to facilitate setting leads and identifying subscribers.

7. Special searches of the NCIC current files or previous records, in addition

to the normal NCIC service.

The DPS is ready to assist the Field in all future major cases. DPS has developed a "Major

system will also benefit the Agent when writing reports, answering inquiries, controlling physical evidence

and for file review prior to trial.

Re Seattle airtel to Bureau 11/1/72.

On 11/7/72, interviews were conducted with the

following individuals assigned to theL

, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia:

b7C

It was the consensus of opinion among the three

that efforts to locat

the attache case by this means would probably prove futile.

The terrain, as described, would neutralize any effort,

particularly if tall trees and mountains are part of its

makeup.

Further explained was the necessity for the

presence of heat which would need to be generated by the

object (attache case) in contrast to the surrounding

terrain for successful infrared high resolution photography.

The size of the attache cuse provides a poor target for

any type of aerial photography, including visual photography.

The following background information is being

provided to the

NOrFOlK DIVISION:

Unsub had with him prior

to the time he jumped the following:

A.

Parachute Back Pack

B. Parachute Chest Pack'

C. Briefcase or attache case

D.

Dark overcoat

E.

A 4x12x14 paper bag

F. A pair of dark slip-on shoes.

G. Wrap around sunglasses with dark rims.

H. 10,000 $20 bills.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case supposedly con-

tained a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case

from the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous

other items he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to

jumping, it would fall almost directly in the path of the

aircraft. The 727 air stairs were lowered sometime after

7:42 p.M. and Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24,

The plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles

during this time.

RES ARTIST'S CONCEPTION

Enclosed is a copy of photo KK5-1 in the Facial

The Bureau advised by teletype dated 12/17/71

as follows:

"It is expected the Seattle Office will continue

to give this matter close supervisory attention and insure

investigation is conducted promptly and thoroughly."

In view of this, the enclosed information is being

permission to examine the Facial Identification Catalogue

and immediately picked out photo +KK5-1 in the Facial Lines

Section stating,

"that is him, except for the ears and hair."

She explained that the person depicted in that particular

photo closely resembled the man; however, the ears of the

hijacker did not protrude as far from the head and she felt

that the hair line should be

somewhat lower than that on the

man depicted on photo KK5-1.

She was very adamant in her

insistence that the artist's conception shown to her was not

a good likeness of the hijacker.

A comparison of the artist's composite of UNSUB

and photo KK5-1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man much

younger than theman depicted in photo Kk5-1. The man in

KK5-1 appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite shows

conclusion of which he remarked, "No fuss." Stewardess

showed Stewardess

the demand notes

and then went to the cockpit where she displayed them to the

captain of the aircraft.

The unsub retrieved these notes

prior to the time the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington.

eighth cigarette is probably the same. Theso cigarettes are

sold in a "soft pack."

You should place strong emphasis on the fact that

Vost Coast aircraft or related industries, particularly

Booing aircraft. These industrios have been hard pressed

economleally, causing a number of lay-offs among professional

personnel as

vell as nonprofessional personnel and fron a

review of the material available at the Bureau, it is entiroly

conceivable that the unsub falls in this category. In view

of this, the following avenues of investigation should be

invostigated by both the Seattle and Portland Offices:

1) Contact professional placement agencies, counselors as well

employment contractors hiring tenporary professional

employees a

2) Contact unemployment agencios.

3) Identify and contact professional societies or

organizations associated with the aircraft industry, boing

alert for anyone that possibly terminated membership or

make him a Veteran of orld far II, or the Korean conflict

designated for à particular area of interest, i.e. parachutes,

witnesses, course; I-A volures and numerous suspect sub-

files.

In addition, physical

evidence as available was

reviewed for pertinent investigative leads.

Infornation set forth following the file review

ARTIST'S SKETCH

A review of the testimony of the principal

witnesses, including the 3 stewardesses, the 2 Northwest

Airline employees (HWA) at Portland, Oregon, and the 5

passengers reflects a general disagreement concerning the

accuracy of the antist's sketch. Numous changes were sug-

gested by these witnesses and some were inplimented in

making up the final artist's sketch.

It is noted that a

Bureau artist personally interviewed the three stewardesses

at Minneapolis,

Minnesota and thereafter prepared a re-

vised sketch of the hijacker showing him with the dark glasses,

which he wore on the airplane, and another skotch, but

without the glasses. One key

withess, l

stewardess, was very adament in her insistence that the

artist's concuption was not a very good likeness of the

hijacker.

It is recommended that a Bureau artist be flown

including Minneapolis, Seattle and

Portland, and spend sufficient time with the key witnesses

until an artist's sketch which is agreeable to the majority

of the witnesses can be obtained.

It is recommended that the Color Selection Guide

be used to provide details and depth not ordinarily shown

in black and white sketches.

It is recommended that the Bureau artist sketch

full face with dark glasses,

side profile, and a sketch showing the hijacker in a standing

position.. All the sketches should be in color.

In addition to the facial identification guide,

the Bureau artist and

Prior to sending the Bureau artist to the various

divisions, it is recommended that a letter of appreciation

from the Bureau be sent to all pertinent witnesses, ex-

pressing Bureau appreciation for their time and effort and

indicating desires regarding artist's sketch.

Following the obtaining of an acceptable color

artist's

sketch, widespread use of these should be made in

interest resulting in new suspects and possible recovery of

some of the ranson money. It is noted that expenses for a

newspaper format for ranson lists and accompanying back-

ground infornation were estinated at actual costs of $1,600

for the Seattle Times, Seattle, Washingion. Color would,

undoubtedly, cost nore.

Bureau Exhibits Section may be able

to cut costs considerably by preparing all material uniformly

prior to submission to najor newspapers.

As a source of continuing value, it is recommended

that display or window space be rented for a period of

not less than six months at major airports in Seattle,

Portland, Los Angeles,

San Francisco and las Vegas, and

that the

Exhibits Section prepare hijacking displays,

including artist's sketches, photograph models, ranson

lists, notices of rewards, etc. It is hoped that this

would promote a sense of awareness and develop additional

suspects. In view of the fact that this display may be

done in such a way as to pronote airline security and

prevent, or discourage future hijackings, najor airlines

may wish to share a portion of the expenses. It is noted

that traffic at the above major airports would have a

heightened avareness of hijackings and would be cognizant

of the hijacking problem.

that the hijacker could be someone that worked on the Boeing

In addition, unsub expressed a desire to

go "anywhere in Mexico".

It is recomended that all divisions having a

concentration of Mexican-American extremists, including

Chicanos, Brown Berets, review exiremists albuns. It is

further suggested that revised colored aketches, when

obtained, be chown to all pertinent Mexican-American sources.

Did the hijacker express a fear

to the stewardess that he would be pulled out of the door

prematurely?

Experienced parachutiste have advised that attempts

to hold the noney without adequately securing it would

probably not be sufficient.

Attempts by unsub to secure

himself to the plane prior to openine ght rear doon of the

aircraft would indicate a fear of being sucked out of the

aircraft as the stewardess feared.

This would indicate

a lack of knowledge about the Boeing 727 and aircraft in

Hijacker was probably not a sporting parachutist

so he relied completely on airline personnel to furnis!

any type of parachute equipment available. As a result, he

ras furnished a chute that would open quickly sith a good

possibility of tearing, a high rate of descent and non-

steerable.

One chute he jumped with was a dumny chute and

would not open. A parachutist with considerable exper-

ience would have been more specific in the type chutes

SUBJECI: NORJAK

Re Bureau airtel 5/17/72.

Pursuant to instructions contained in referenced

airtel, an extensive file review of captioned case was con-

ducted.

Among the files reviewer were the main volumes,

numbered I through 47, sub-files designated for particular

areas of interest, i.e., Parachutes, Witnesses, Course, 1-A

volumes

and numerous suspect files.

In addition, an examina-

tion was made of all physical evidence being maintained at

Seattle, for pertinent investigative leads.

As a result of this review, the following suggestions

are being proposed:

REWARD: This case has generated world-wide attention and

many suspects

have been suggested and are continuing

to be received. However, since nothing of value has yet been

developed, it is felt that the prospect of a substantial

reward for information leading to the identification and

conviction of this hijacker, might entice someone to come

forward and name the hijacker.

To be realistic, the rewara would have to be

attractive to the person furnishing the information and

therefore, a sum of not less than, $25,000 is reconmended.

The

reward money could be provided either by the

Department of Justico, or by the airlines, or by both.

the

only reward at the moment is $5,000, offered by the Seattle,

Washington newspaper SEATTLE POST INTELLIGENCER "Secret

Witness Progran."

SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES: Since nothing was found in the search

conducted by the Army in March and

Abril, 1972 of the probable drop area in southuestern

Hashington, It now anpears quite possible that the hijacker

escaped safely and might have secreted the money in a

safe deposit box.

It is reconnended that nation-uide circularization

be made of all banks, savings and loan associations and

conmerical companies offering this type security.

Tach

such location vould be furnished with a description of the

subject and the artist's conception showing the hijacker

with and without the glasses.

•FOLING COMPANY: In 1963-1964, The Boeing Company had

a team of 20

to 30 engineers and test

pilots experimenting with the air stairs of The Eoeing 727

to determine the plane's adaptability for dropping cargo

or personnel.

In the tests conducted the air stairs were

Ienoved and packages vere dropped from the plane using an

especially designed chute.

b7E

The Boeing Company

has furnished the names of their

employces who were involved in that experiment and investi

gation is being conducted to determine if one of there could be

the hijacker. They are also being interviewed for any info they

may have as to the identity of the hijacker.

Seattle is continuing to screen suspects in this

matter, which are received from various sources and vill

give expedite attention to any worthuhile information

obtained.

the aircraft, but thought it may have something to do with the hijacking.

Although this, in itself is of little investigative galue, the question

arose that the unsub may have had an accomplice and was removed from the ground

after landing by aircraft. Has the FAA and/or the suitable monitoring agency been

contacied for idontification of all aircraft in the pertient area where the hijacker

could have landed.. It hen been the writerts experience to be a passenger in a

small plane south of the Codumbia Rivor noar Mount Adam Hood and hear radio

FAA luburn report they had our plane on radar and told us eractly there we were.

as well as what to expect in other aircraft passing through the area.

On 12/20/71 I talked to SAC HELD in Minneapolis.

I told him that we had made extensive efforts to search the

area where the hijacker is believed to have jumped, without

discovering any evidence of his whereabouts or identity.

The Northwest Airlines people here have advised

that they would be glad to simulate his flight, having a

man jump to see whether the crew experienced the same

reaction as recorded on the initial flight, and if the

flight recorder records the same movement of the plane.

If it did not, then it would appear that there was little use

searching in the area we were searching in.

If it did have

the same reaction,

then we would have to search an area

approximately 2½ miles by 6 miles of virgin timber.

I told SAC HELD I thought it would be well if

possible to have the same airplane used with the same crew

but I did not see any reason for them to actually jump in

the same area since it would be too dangerous and we may

lose the jumper, but I did think it would be a good idea to

simulate it in an area where the jumper could be recovered.

He advised he had taked to Mr. NYROP about this

and that he had instructed that the crew and plane be put

together for this purpose as soon as possible.

I inquired of him the status of their proposed

offer of a reward and he advised Mr. NYROP had told him

that the Seattle P-I Secret Witness Program had announced

furnished to Northwest Airlines or the FBI, furnishing

the

identity of the hijacker and evidence to assist in his

conviction.

SA THOMAS J. MANNING

NORJAK

Based upon maps received this date at Longview RA pin pointin

a search area where the hi jacker could have lande

and anticipating

a walking search to be conducted in the near future in extremely wooded

and somewhat hazardous terrain the following suggestions are being

made.

Once the

search date is fixed thismatter be made a Special

with the four California offices, Portland and Seattle to furnish

four or five agents to participate in the search on a volunteer

basis.

The voluntary aspect is being emphasized in view of the terrain

to be searched and the uncomfortable conditions which will undoubtedly

be experienced by the searching personnel.

It is recommended that volunteers be sought from individuals

who have some,and preferably extensive, experience in the use of a

compass and hiking and camping experience and who are physically

qualified to spend a period of time in a densely wooded area on what

is essentially a problem similar to a military field exercise.

It is further recommended that the agent personnel assigned

be cognizant of the fact that once the operation starts they will be

required to remain overnight in their assigned searching areas rather

than retracing areas covered to go to and from a base camp.

A list of recommended items to be secured for logistic support

of this special is being prepared by the writer the majority of

which can be secured from the Army or the Navy at little or no cost

to the Bureau.

Aerial photographs of the search area as set forth by the

map of

Iplus terrain maps are presently being secured

In order that the search area may be properly divided for maximum

b6

b70

coverage by searching agents.

It is also recommêdded that this search be a completely Bureau

operation involving no outside agencies so as to limit the amount of

publicity which is generated.

It is felt that the prime and secondary search areas, while

in rough terrain, can be adequately searched by a small, select groun

of dedicated personnel who are doing it voluntarily and the search

will either find the hijacker or lead to the conclusion that the area

pinpointed by all available technical data has been completely combed

for traces of the subject.

U.S. AIR FORCE SR-71 AIRCRAFY

The Sacramento Division in a telotype dated

had offered, free of charge to the Burcau, use of an

SR-71 aircrait to photograph torrain over which

the hijached airplane had flown on its trip to reno.

This aircraft was describod as an extrenoly

sophisticated acrial reconnalssance plane which would

photograph a strip 20 niles wide with photographic resolution

of detecting objects on the ground? feat squaro. The

film strip would then be roviewed by trained and qualified

U.S, Air Force personnel.

Due to weather conditions along the route, being

inclement at times, the flight never was made.

On 1/10/72 the writer contacted SAC JOHN WILLIAMS,

Sacramento, and explained the results of the experiment

оп 1/6/72.

I. WILLINS was requested to have the Air

Force contacted to sec if the flight could be made only

over the State of Washington and perhaps from the Columbia

Rivor to a point some 30 miles north.

He was also asked

if the Air Forco could advise what we could expect of such

an over flight in the way of information which would be

helpful in the search of this terrain.

In response to the above call, SA

who has been handling the hijacking case at

Sacramento,

advised he had contacted Boale ArB and nade

the request

for the over flight and that he would attempt to determine

if it could be made, noting that weather conditions still

arc effective.

it was his intention to take any potential suspects still re-

portion of the remaining because of age differences between

them and UNSUB in this matter. In addition to age differences,
