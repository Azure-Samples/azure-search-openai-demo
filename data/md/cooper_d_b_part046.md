advised that he found the beach area

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post äredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer, and below that an older sand layer. The upper layer.

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money.

This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were

not severely damaged or rusted. The

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a nuch more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dredge) sand was a mix

ture of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size.

Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the Columbia

River at this site in 1974,l

_ stated this clay layer

older sands, which

layer, he found cross bedded course and medium sand, which in-

dicated the river and river waves had worked repeatedly on this

layer since 1974. The upper six inches to eight inches of re-

the location where it was found by natural river flow and was

probably placed at the location of Tena Bar during the last

Re Seattle airtel to Portland, 2/11/81.

Enclosed for Seattle is one packet of four photographs.

Referenced airtel set out leads for enclosed photographs

to be shown to

Eugene, Oregon.

Portland notes that the photograph of suspect,

was not accompanied by appropriate throw-down photo-

graphs which would be required in the event thatl

makes a positive identification. In view of the

fact that the

photograph ofl

projects it so as to depict has been altered by the special

with the same hair as shown

in the artist's conception of D.B. COOPER, Portland would have no

way of independently coming up with additional photographs which

are similar in appearance so that the photograph of_

is not

unique.

Prior to the display of any witnesses in this matter,

an appropriate photo spread should be developed to meet any legal

challenge to any identifications which might result.

Portland has placed this case in an RUC status.

In geologist's opinion

'Cooper' money spent 8

By LESLIE L. ZAITZ

of The Oregonian staff

At least some of the cash from "Dan

Cooper's" 1971 escapade has spent

The Oregonian

much of the past eight years under wa-

ter and only recently was washed up on

the Columbia River bank where it was

i FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1980

found Sunday, according to a geologist

assisting the FBI.

Leonard Palmer, a Portland State

University geologist, reached that con-

clusion after examining the river bank i

nine miles northwest of Vancouver,

years in river

Wash., where a family building a camp-

fire found three packets of badly deteri-

orated $20 bills.

The FBI said the money, believed to

be several thousand dollars, was part of

the $200,000 ransom paid to a man,

known only as Dan Cooper. Cooper,

popularly known as "D.B. Cooper" be-

cause of an erroneous news agency re-

port at the time, received the money

after hijacking a Northwest Airlines jet-

liner after it departed from Portland

Nov. 24, 1971.

Palmer's research discounted an ini-

tial FBI theory that the cash had been

deposited on the river bank during a

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers channel

dredging operation in 1974. Palmer said

there were two other distinct layers of

sand and sediment on top of the materi-.

ai dredged from the river.

The money was found in a layer of

coarse sand ranging from several inches !

to 4 feet thick, Palmer said. He said the !

top layer of sand probably was deposit-

ed by wave action caused by passing

ships.

Palmer said he believed the money

found its way into the water not long i

after the hijacking, because it would

have deteriorated within weeks if left

exposed on the surface.

Palmer offered a theory for what

happened, based on what little evidence

exists and on geological information. It;

COOPER'S CASH - Portland State University geologist Leonard Palmer

discusses probable history of $20 bills found Sunday on Vancouver, Wash.,

beach. The money, part of ransom paid to hljacker "Dan Cooper," washed

ashore recentiy after spending about eight years in water, Palmer says.

begins with Cooper parachuting from

the Boeing 727 somewhere over South-

west Washington.

Cooper may have landed in a wil-

derness alive and then decided to find a

stream to follow out of the woods,

Palmer speculated. He said the chance

that Cooper landed in water was re-

in trouble. He had gone through a lot of

work to get that money," Palmer said

"But there were plenty of reasons for

him to be in trouble."

Whatever the source of the trouble,

the money entered the water.

"Up to that point, it's conjecture,"

Palmer said. "But once we have it in the

water, we know what happened to it."

The bills spent the next nine years

: Once Cooper got to the water,

comething happened that caused him to

hecome separated from at least part of

the money, Palmer continued.

"He would not let go unless he was

moving slowly downstream, probably

getting caught at spots on the stream

bottom, resting there a time and then

becoming dislodged by river action.

The bills recovered Sunday were

as long a year if they were well pre-

served in the water, he added

The FBI sent the decomposed $20

bills Wednesday to its Washington,

D.C., laboratory.

The FBI ultimately plans to return

the money to its proper owner when it

determines whether the owner is

Northwest Airlines or Royal Globe In-

surance Co. of New York, which cov-

ered the loss. The airline's offer of a

$25,000 reward for return of the money

has expired.

Charles Arnold, a spokesman for the

U.S. Treasury Department in Washing-

ton, D.C., said the tattered bills would

be replaced at face value if they were

returned to the Treasury,

Responsibility for the Cooper inves-

tigation Thursday was returned to the

FBI office in Seattle. Technically, the

Seattle field office has been in charge of

the hijacking investigation.

Jack Pringle, assistant special agent

in charge of the Seattle office, said

there was a chance that laboratory tests

Preliminary results were not ex-

pected until next week.

The FBI has asked the Corps of En-

gineers to begin assessing streamflows

of the Columbia and its tributaries in

the Washougal River-watershed.

At approximately 3:22

p.m., while the flight was en route to seattle, washington, he

indicated to the stewardess that his briefcase contained a bom

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four (4) parachutes in

exchange for the safety of the 36 passengers aboard the plane.

When

the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington, Northwest Orient Airlines

complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and the money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and two airline

He further found, buried

in the dirt floor of the barn, a container with a box that said,

"Silencer" on it. The box was empty.

He further found 30 or more apple boxes, containing

books, which indicated they had been taken from various libraries.

These books had to do with stories on Hitler, medical books,

spy stories and other topics.

He has learned that Dr. Roman was apparently the first

doctor to become an astronaut and has found documents which indicate

Roman was

a jet pilot.

In amongst the items indicating Roman was

in the United States

"Top Secret."

These items, he recalls, also had the stamp of "Declassified" on

The majority of the items that he found in the home

were provided to the lawyer for the estate for subsequent dis-

persement to the appropriate relatives.

He is bringing this matter to the attention of the

FBI, inasmuch as the whole situation appears to be extremely

bizarre to him. While he is in no way certain this matter is

involved with the D. B. Cooper matter, it is interesting to

note that DI. Roman was a jet pilot, was apparently knowledgeable

of airplanes and resided in an area

I adjacent to the flight path

of Cooper's plane.

Living with a Legend

by SA Billy Bob Williams

Webster's New World Dictionary

includes, among its thousands of word

definitions, many words which are of

opposite meaning. The dictionary

defines immortality as "lasting fame."

It defines anonymity as "the quality or

state of being anonymous (as through

absence or lack of identity)." Through-

out history, numerous criminal person-

alities have been described by one or the

other of these words, but few, such as

"Jack the Ripper," qualified for both

titles.

One such individual stepped through

the door of a Boeing 727 on a stormy

Thanksgiving eve in 1971. At the time

the plane was 10,000 feet over southern

Washington state, and the middle-aged

man took with him $200,000 in cash.

Possibly the first successful parachute

hijacking of an American airliner had

occurred, and the name D. B. Cooper

would become a household word in the

Pacific Northwest and known through-

out the world.

The hijack took place shortly after

Northwest Airlines Flight 305 departed

the Portland, Oregon, International

Airport en route to the Seattle-Tacoma

Airport. A man, later found listed on

the manifest as Dan Cooper, threatened

a stewardess with what he claimed

was a bomb. The plane landed at "Sea-

Tac" where his demand for $200,000

and four parachutes was complied

with. The passengers and several mem-

bers of the crew were allowed to leave

the plane, and at 7:46 p.m, the plane

left "Sea-Tac"' and flew toward Reno,

Nevada. A short time later the hijacker,

left alone in the cabin, is believed to

have jumped, without boots, helmet,

or protective clothing, into some of the

roughest terrain on the North American

Continent. On the night of his jump,

the weather could only be described as

vicious. Despite many hours of ground

search and additional hundreds of

hours of investigation, the man has

neither been found nor identified.

Dan Cooper, whose origin was never

established, became D. B. Cooper when

members of the news media overheard

law enforcement officers discussing a

possible suspect with that name. The

name was published and has become a

part of the legend,

The area into which Cooper fell is

approximately 25 miles north of

Portland, Oregon. Part of the estimated

150 square miles of drop zone is now

included in the red zone, or dangerous

area, surrounding the country's newest

volcano, Mt. St. Helens. The entire

crime took place within the jurisdiction

of the Seattle FBI Office, but because

of its proximity to Portland, the media

and the public frequently associate the

Portland Office with the investigation.

A closely coordinated investigative

effort has been maintained between the

two offices throughout the years with an

occasional sprinkling of rivalry thrown

in when it appeared a significant lead

might be developing.

There has been only one real lead; that

surfaced in 1980 when an eight-year-old

boy found almost $6,000 of the ransom

money on the banks of the Columbia

River near Vancouver, Washington.

The only result of the find was a rein-

forcement of the belief that Cooper

probably died the night of the jump.

122-2

The legend now makes Cooper a folk

hero in the mountains of southern

Washington, but in considering the

matter, one should remember that

Cooper's apparent success laid the

foundation for the several hundred

hijackings which have occurred in the

past nine years.

Although Cooper has never been identi-

fied, he is never far from the minds of

flight, or participated in efforts to frec

those aboard such a flight, the exper

ence has included varying degrees o

rustration and terrot

The FBI and other law enforcement

agencies around the world have lived

with Cooper's legend on a daily basis

since 1971. New techniques to enter

planes and make rescues have been

developed, profiles of potential hi-

jackers formulated, communication

networks strengthened, and hostage

negotiators trained in an effort to insure

the safety of the air traveler. Every

operation has its share of problems, but

when the call goes out in an FBI office

that a hijacking is in progress, you will

soon see the very best effort each and

every employee can put forth. The satis-

faction derived from participating in a

successful recovery of hostages and

apprehension of their tormentor is one

that is seldom equaled.

For the personnel of the Seattle and

Portland Offices, the legend lives on in

the form of one of the longest,

continuous criminal investigations in

the history of the FBI.

prior to the captioned hijacking, promoted the San Francisco

Case Agent to submit this communication offering him as a

with foul play following his discharge from the Army and that

someone, other than their son, was using his Social Security card

San Francisco responded to the Senator and

parents explaining that he was still alive in August, 1979, however,

further pursuit of this investigation was discontinued due to his

adulthood, his rights under the Privacy Act, and that no federal

Jurisdiction existed. His whereabouts at this point is unknown

by the San Francisco Division.

-

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male boarded

contained a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36 passengers aboard the

plane. When the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes and the money, the hijacker

allowed all passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into

the first-class section of the aircraft and informed them he

desired to fly to Mexico City.

The hijacker instructed that

the plane proceed in a southerly direction and fly at a low.

altitude and slow

speed

which would enable the rear door

of the plane (Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel. It was determined the hijacker, two

parachutes, and the ransom money had disappeared when the

Artist conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Exhibit

Section and are considered a reasorablelikeness. The black

and white composites were prepared initially, and some time

later the color composites were prepared to depict the

hijacker's complexion and age more graphically.

Himmetsbach of West.Linn; Ore.

S. The movie begins where the known

facts, end

about

America's

most

famous skyjacker, the only one never

caught.

The film follows its fictional

Cooper as he flees across the western

United States towards Mexico with a

pretty girl and the $200,000 extorted

from the airline.

Himinelsbach;

who is writing. a

book on the case, speculates Cooper

*was probably an ex-con no one missed

when he disappeared and whose bones

lie somewhere in the Washougal

River basin:

The :Columbian took the retired

agent, now 56, to the film to get his

reaction. From the opening moments,

the film left the 28-year FBI veteran

shakinghis.head.

The film shows Cooper, played by

Treat Williams, bailing out of a

"Northern Pacific" jetlimer on Nov.

p4, 1971, under clear, sunny skies,

landing near cached survival equip-

ment (including a jeep) in a pine-

D. B. Cooper

jasportion considering he escapest em yes,

ESCAPED: - by parachuting into the

Southern California countryside. The one

that did it, AND COT AWAY, that's

Daniel B. Cooper.

Legend has it, however, that Cooper

dropped the money, either in part or all, as

he floated to cart, and that twenty-dollar

bills were chus deposited lizan home the

sowus and villages in his landingara. Yes.

strangely, none of the moncy, not one

burk!, was ever found, and

suinge, cory year, on the anniversary of

his escape, the towns and villages in that

area throw a "D.B. Cooper Celebration" 10

honor him for, well, for something! They

appreciate him,

though one can only

speculate as to why, and there seems to bea

genuine hope that the dels never catch him,

wherever he may lor.

November 7, 1981

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D. O.

Dear Sir,

Several years ago a man hijacked a plane, parachutea out

with some money and was never heard of again. His name was

listed as D. B. Cooper.

I recall that some of the money was lound and that now

he 1s presumed to be dead.

My reason for writing this letter--i hope that you will

not think me foolish--is that several weeks ago I had a dream

about this. Actually, It was more as if I just awakened and

knew his name. This may not mean anything at all, but I have

never knowd anyone by this nane and I am curlous about why I

would have dreamed this.

The name was

I have followed this story in the news, but have never

really thought a lot about it.

I cannot even recall where it

happened.

I am just curious about this

and whether this could be

true. I do believe that dreams are sometines trying to tell

us things.

If you could check this out without too much trouble, I

would appreciate it and I would also appreciate your letting

me know what your findings are. It would satisfy my curiosity.

Thanking you, I am,

DeaI

My purpose in writing is two-fold.

First, a while ago a client of mine wrote me a letter

regarding an acquaintance of hers,

who apparently could have been involved in the

Northwest Air Lines robbery in 1971. Rather than synopsizing her

information I have included a photo copy thereof. Her observations

are interesting and I can think of no other way of informally inquiring

into their validity than through your office.

I believe that she is interested in finding out if a reward is

available,

assuming her information is correct. Naturally this is

one reason for the confidentiality of my request, other than the

obvious potential civil liabilities.

The other matter I am interested in is the purchase of the

Nicoll-Sill House, Otherwise known as the Bethlehem House, an

historic 1735

structure located in the Town of Bethlehem. Since

the structure is on the National Historic Register, it is entitled to a

25% first year investment tax credit to peysons buying into a limited

partnership for the purpose of purchase and restoration, Additionally,

limited partners would be entitled to a proportionate share of the

15-year depreciation available to historic structures under the new

tax act, and also a share of the dedactions available through the

conveyance of a facade easement, by the limited partners, to the

Town of Bethlehem, Losses also would be deductible. For example,

an investment of $20, 000. would yield during tax year 198z a $5,000.

tax credit as a start, and, depending upon the total amount invested in

the structure (probably $60, 000.), a significant depreciation number.

If 1 can secure an appropriate appraisal stating that the highest and...

best use of the site is for light industrial purposes, the value of the

facade easement (which would limit the buildings use substantially)

becomes readily apparent. The 5 acre site is adjacent torthe-Toms

The bones included rib and spinal

The bag was found about 100 yards

Something was written on it, but she

did.not remember what.

She found the $1 bill, torn in four

qual pieces, shortly before coming

on the bones, she said

Three other persons were on the

ride when the bories were spotted in

the Proebstel area near Green Moun-

tain, about 10 miles 'east of Van-

Another rider said the bag looked

like an airline bag: It had the name of

an airline written on it, but he could

not recall which, he said:

The possibility was raised that the

bones could be those of the elusive

"D.B. Cooper," who hijacked a North-

$200,000 somewhere over Southwest
