Press Register 17-E

Properly packed parcels please postal people

By MOLLY HUNTER

Living Today Writer

It's that time again when the

world begins thinking about holi-

day mailing - the time of year

when millions of packages are

delivered safely and on time -

or not delivered safely and on

time

mail, such as the bars at the end

of the slides and the eight miles

of conveyer belts, which involve

many sharp

turns.

There was

quite

bit of equipment

modification after this study."

he said.

Undeliverable

packages,

mainly due to improper packag-

ing by the sender,

is something

that is and probably always will

be a problem. There will never

be a systent, according to J.K.

Lee Sr., Postmaster, that will be

100 percent damage free.

The greatest percentage of un-

deliverable

packages

begins

with improper packaging by the

sender.

"It the package is not

wrapped properly, the sender is

doing hims if a disfavor." Mr.

Lee said.

Mr. Lee

explained

a new

nationwide system that has been

worked

out.

When a

clerk

accepts a package at the win-

dow,

he must initial it in the

lower right hand corner

of the

box.

This helps identify

who

accepted

the

parcel,

SO

if

parcel is improperly packaged

it is brought to the attention of

the clerk responsible in order for

him to become aware of such

things in the future.

Last April. Mr. Lee devoted a

great deal of time working with

a group of men at the Atlanta

Bulk Mail Center to identify any

damage

"We

points

the

worked

center.

and nigh

studying

each

point in

the

process of handling, loading And

conveying. We went to extreme

lengths to pad and cushton

various points that we found la

hazardous in

the

loading

process and handling of the bulk

The

result? A significant

reduced number

of

damaged

packages. Tossing and throwing

has

also

been

completely

eliminated from the loading

process, he added.

One may

ask the

common

question about what happens to

the packages that

delivered.

are

never

If the package has any sort of

• identification

anywhere on the

outside or inside of it, it is given

"first

aid

treatment",

which

usually involves taping up loose

flaps with the strong nylon rein-

forced tape.

This sort of thing,

He added that the post office

tries to improve the system all

the

time by

encouraging

the

sender to

pack his parcels

properly.

Mr.

Lee said the

secret to whether it gets to its

final destination or not is in the

strength of the box that is used

and the cushioning inside of the

box.

according to Mir. Lee, is ususual-

ly detected during one of the

sorting stages - it is extracted

from the group, put in a plastic

container and sent to "rewrap."

Books, Mr. Lee stressed. are the

most

common problem

since

they are so heavy. They have a

special machine that places

metal bands on the box of books

to insure

against any more

about 18/ million were issued. Weak

public demand, primarily a result of the

$2 bills' relative scarcity, contributed to

the discontinuance.

By contrast, 225 million of the new series

1976 bills were available on April 13,

1976, and about 400 million notes will be

circulated by this summer.

The reissue of the two-dollar denomina-

tion was prompted in part by a Harvard

School of Business study that showed a

need for a currency between $1 and $5

In addition, the new $2 notes are ex-

pected to cut the volume of 51 notes in

nalt over the next several vears, which

should result in a savings of about $35

million for the Federal Reserve System

and the Treasury Department.

The new $2 bill, issued on Thomas Jef-

ferson's birthday, bears his portrait

which was painted in the early 1800s by

Gilbert Stuart. The face plate is quite

similar to the previous issue.

The design of the reverse plate of the bill

is completely new. It bears a vignette of

John Trumbull's painting, "The Signing

of the Declaration of Independence.

However, design considerations re-

quired that six figures appearing on the

extreme left and right hand borders of

the original art were dropped in the ren-

The two-dollar bill is being issued in con-

junction with the Bicentennial. However,

it is seen as a permanent addition to

currency in circulation and will continue

THE TWO-DOLLAR BILL-

A BICENTENNIAL REISSUE

The crisp new $2 bill that you may have

in your pocket or purse has a rich tradi-

tion in American History. Two hundred

years ago, June 25, 1776, just nine days

before the signing of the Declaration of

Independence, the Continental Con-

gress issued the first two-dollar "bills of

credit for the defense of America."

Since 1862, they have been issued as

official U.S. currency appearing as U.S.

notes, silver certificates, treasury notes,

national bank currencies and Federal

Reserve Notes.

Two-dollar bills were last printed in 1965

and were discontinued in 1966. Only

begin saving for that future education.

Let your accumulating savings interest

offset the rising cost.

The important question for you to face

is--How much do 1 save each year to

accumulate the necessary funds to meet

the rising costs? Economists suggest

this formula:

Amount to

year

Estimated yearly

expense x 4

# of years till college + 3

The estimated yearly expense of $3000

times four years of school divided by the

nine years left until she starts college

plus three equals $1000.

Remember the accumulated interest on

your savings account each year more

than offsets the rising cost of higher

education. But beware the later you

start saving the more you must save

each year.

THE IDLE DOLLAR-

A MYTH

Dollars deposited in your bank do not, as

many believe, remain idle in the bank.

With absolute safety to you, your de-

posits help expand the local economy,

create higher personal income and in-

crease our state's net worth.

Banks must keep only a portion of their

deposits as cash reserves. Much of the

remainder is available for lending and for

turnover in the local economy—to fi-

nance expanding business, industry,

farming operations and personal needs

such as cars, homes and appliances.

The loans actually create new jobs,

higher incomes and greater demands

from consumers, all of which create new

deposits which provide for more new

loans. This multiplies the effect of the

original deposit.

Your deposits also benefit the economy

of the state through assisting in com-

munity developments through the pur-

chase of bonds issued to build schools,

construct other public buildings, water-

works, make street improvements, build-

ing parks and other civic projects.

Deposits of public funds are also at

work. Surplus funds of local govern-

ments which remain in our banking sys-

tem until they are spent create new

money, allow more spending and ex-

pand the state's economy.

Your deposited dollars and those of your

friends, acquaintances and neighbor-

hood businessmen are always at work

benefiting your community, your state

and you.

IS YOUR HOME

BURGLAR PROOF?

Apartment dwellers and home owners

alike are susceptible to the professional

burglars of today. No amount of insur-

ance can spare you the agony and

heartbreak of having irreplaceable

prized personal possessions stolen.

Even though it is almost impossible to

completely burgiar-proof your home in

this era of burglaries not only in the big

cities but in the suburbs and countryside

as well, it is advantageous for you to plan

your home protection carefully.

• Don't assume that burglars operate

only at night. The number of daytime

burglaries (as many as at night) is on

the rise.

• Use cylinder (dead-bolt) locks on all

outside doors and make sure that un-

used doors are always locked.

• Purchase a peephole, so you can see

who's at the door before you open it.

• Don't put any identification on your

keys.

• Make sure that door hinges are on the

inside.

• Have locks and keys changed if you

move to a new home or apartment.

• Keep a record of the serial numbers of

items that carry them.

• Use the property identification system

endorsed by your local police.

• Investigate the possibility of having an

alarm system installed.

WHEN TO USE SPECIALIZED CHECKS!

Most bank customers are quite familiar

with personal checks, but the realm of

specialized items is not always quite so

clear . . . certified checks, cashier's

checks, money orders and traveler's

checks!

What is a certified check? A certified

check is a guarantee that funds have

been set aside to cover the amount of

the check. To purchase one, go to the

bank, write a personal check for the

proper amount. The bank sets aside that

amount of money from your account and

stamps "Cerlified" across the face of

UNIT PRICING-

A SAVINGS TOOL

A product's unit price is how much the

item costs per pound, per ounce, per

pint, and so on. Because different

brands of the same product may come in

different sized packaging, the best way

to know which costs less is to compare

the unit price.

To figure the unit price yourself, simply

divide the price of the item by the amount

in the package. For example: a 12 oz.

can of frozen lemonade for 48¢ (4g per

ounce) is 1c less per ounce than a 6 oz.

can of frozen lemonade for 30€ (5¢ per

ounce).

Many stores are now posting unit prices

on the shelves near the item. This is a

big help for economy conscious shop-

pers.

your check. Certified checks are most

often used to make large purchases or to

close on homes.

What is a cashier's check? A cashier's

check is a bank-guaranteed check, the

bank's own order to make payment out

of bank funds. When you purchase this

check, you specify to whom the bank

should make out the check and retain a

carbon or stub for your records. It's a

safe way to transfer major amounts of

money from one place to another.

What about a money order? It's a means

of transferring money without using cash

or a personal check and can be pur-

chased at the bank. It will show your

name as purchaser and the name of the

person who is to receive the payment.

What is a traveler's check? It is a spe-

cially designed payment devised for

people away from home and can be

cashed throughout the world. The

checks are preprinted in various de-

nominations, usually $10, $20, $50 and

$100. You choose the total amount you

wish to buy and the denominations as

well.

When you purchase traveler's checks,

you sign your name in a designated

place on each one. mmediately before

cashing a check, you sign it again. If

traveler's checks are lost or stolen, your

money will be refunded.

Note: A small fee is normally charged for

these specialized items!
