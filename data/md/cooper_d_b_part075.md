Let A A

EARI JAY COSSEY, 349 N. 101st, SU 3-0475,

the individual who packed the original parachutes used

by the hijacker, was contacted 1/4/72, at which time he

advised he had made over 2,500 parachute jumps, and has

10 years experience.

He is a Master Parachute Rigger

and has trained 1,000 other individuals in parachuting.

He has a

• "D" rating as an expert parachutist with the

American Association of Parachutists with "Diamond Wings

Award".

He is a pilot with 350 flight hours and has

flown as large a plane as co-pilot with Lockheed Lodestar,

a two engine plane.

He was born 8/30/38 at Oakley, Utah.

Ke has a college degree in Psychology from Weber State

College, Logan, Utah, in 1966. He is now studying for

his Masters Degree at the University of Rashington and has

his own parachute jumping equipment. He is a WMA, 5'7",

160 lbs., and when dressed for a jump such as this would

weigh over 200 lbs.,

and probably about 220, which is

comparable to the weight of the hijacker, with the money.

McChord Air Force Base, but believed that the first test

I called OLROGG and told him that it did not appear

from the wording of Springfield teletype that McChora was

precluded from furnishing live volunteers.

He said apparently

there was a question of interpretation but that the man he

talked to in McChord was pretty firm that they were not going

to furnish any live people.

He said, however, that he would:.

continue contact with McChord to get

the final word.

I sent a teletype to Minneapolis and told them

to advise

only clearance we had so far from the Air Force was to supply

personnel to assist in a dummy drop and not a live parachute

TO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES:

On the afternoon of November 24, 1971, a Northwest

Airlines Boeing 727, bound from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle,

Washington, was hijacked on take-off at Portland.

The hijacker who boarded at Portland, and who

threatened to detonate a bomb allegedly carried in his

briefcase, was given $200,00k in used twenty dollar bills

and four parachutes, when

the plane landed at Seattle.

All passengers and part of the crew were then permitted to

leave the plane.

The aircraft took off from Seattle, and the hijacker

is believed to have left the aircraft, using

the parachutes,

over the southwestern part of Washington State.

The hijacker has not been identified and no trace

has been found of him, the parachutes, or the money.

A composite description of the hijacker and

two photographs of an artist's conception, are set out:

RE: MISSING PERSONS PROJECT

On 12/27/71, L

I called from the Bureau.

le advised he considered our suggestion re circularization

to law enforcement agencies in the western part of the

country, to see if they had

a missing persons report with

them answering the hijacker's description. He wanted

to know if we had done it in Washington and Oregon and I

advised him we had not, but we had readily available,

facilities over the teletype system that we could do it.

He advised he was recommending to Mr. HOOVER

we do it in Washington and Oregon first and see what

results were obtained before we spread it further.

Dear Mr. Milnes,

Now that the Army's participation in the search for D. B. Cooper

has

been completed, I would like to express to you my appreciation

for the outstanding assistance and cooperation which you and your

agents gave to

_and his squadron.

It would have been

understandable had the Bureau confined its participation only to

those aspects of the search which required the presence of its

agents.

To the contrary, your agents participated to the fullest

extent, and the manner in

which they did so was most impressive.

Their

willingness to share the hardships of field duty and their

cheerful cooperation in the search efforts reflects most favorably

on their professionalism and on your leadership.

On behalf of all Army members of the search force, I express my

sincere appreciation to you and all agents who took part in the

operation.

Sincerely,

the claims resulting from the horjak search were paid through

the Pept. of Justice rather than Army claims but the Army

felt they could handle this particular matter.

It is requested that to avoid embarassment to the Bureau

on this matter in view of the long standing claim that some

contact be, made with Army claims to determine their disposition

may be advised

on action being taken.

as a result of the vrious claims that occurred from the

activity of the third armored cavalry Division he had been

in contact with the United States Army Claims Service,

Fort George Meade, Maryland, who in turn had contacted

the

in the following as the procedure in handling the above

claims:

Because of Posse. Comitatis the Army felt that

they could not pay the claims as there was some question

whether they should have been involved in the search activity.

they agreed, however, to receive all of the claims, negotiate

tor a settlement, and upon determining the amount involved would

notify the Justice Department who would pay the claim.

He advised, however, that he had not received a claim from

These inquiries were

directed to SA RICHARD A. DYER for transmission to the proper

authorities at Fort Lewis, Washington.

SA DYER advised on 12/17/72

that he has called.

this matter to the attention of

others at Ft. Levis on at least seven or eight occasions and

was advised

one one of the occasions that it was not the US Army

responsibility but was rather a FBI matter to have the property

made whole.

The enclosure was sent to

immediate repair to their

property.

All details of the damage

to the property have been placed in memo form and are in the

I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you for

your property to establish their bivouac site while they searched for

Eefore we terminated our operation on 18 April, I directed that a

thorough clean up be made. In addition, I hoce, to arrange for a

regrading of access roads to the camp sites. I hope that this will

assist in repairing any damage to the land we used.

Again, thank you for your kind consideration and assistance iron both

This will confirm your telephone conversation

of this office on November 9, 1972, relative to a claim you

have filed with

the U.S. Army, to be reimbursed for property

damage sustained by you, as well as a personal injury sus-

tained by one of your employees, as a result of a search

conducted by elements of the Third Armored Cavalry Division

over your property during March of 1972.

As you are aware, this matter was brought to the

attention of the U. S. Army at Fort Lewis, Washington, on

April 14, 1972, by a Special Agent of this office.

It is suggested that you might desire to contact

the Claims Officer, U. S. Army, Fort Lewis, Washington, for

Title: NORJAK

Synopsis:

Request Bureau and Attorney General authority for the

offering

a $100,000 reward for specific evidence leading to

the resolution of this case. This was discussed between Seattle

SAC Charles E. Mandigo and Section Chief Andreas Stephens on

8/18/2000

Details: to summarize, this case involving the 11/24/1971

hijacking of Northwest

flight 305 has remained the only unsolved

hijacking in U.S. history.

Seattle has processed well over 1100

subjects over the years and virtually every other field division

has also expended significant investigative resources. Other

than a small portion of the $200,000 ransom money being recovered

along the bank of the Columbia River, near Vancouver, Washington

in February, 1980, no trace of the unidentified subject has ever

been found. A recently updated prosecutive opinion received from

the Seattle USA's office and DOJ has continued to indicate that a

statute of limitations does not apply in this matter. At the

time of this crime, airplane hijacking was a capital offense in

the United States.

This hijacking, due to its singular nature,

certainly contributed to the acceleration of sweeping changes in

U.S. airport security and thus had a direct and long lasting

impact on the traveling public.

The hijacking of Northwest 305 continues to garner

media attention. Seattle continues to receive numerous media

inquiries (about fifty in the past year alone). Pursuant to

recent requests from the National Press Office, Seattle

cooperated in the new production of a special on the History

Dear Mr. Reed:

I am terribly sorry to have been so

long in replying to your letter of October 21

in regard to the Post-Intelligencer's $5,000

reward for the arrest and conviction of D. B.

Cooper.

Unfortunately I have been out of the

city and also have been wrestling with the

problem of the reward.

We finally have concluded that the

offer of the reward will end 'as of December

31, 1976.

Should you have any inquiries about

the reward after the first of the year, you,

therefore, can: inform the individuals involved

that it no longer is in effect.

With best regards, .

Kath? Than

Washington, D. C.

Gentlemen:

A number of weeks ago

I called the Indianapolis

office of the FBI and

relayed the contents of

the two inclosed news

items to the lady who took

my call. It seemed to me that an investifation

of the bills found in Newfoundland would be in

order, especially since the serial numbers of

the Cooper ransom bills are known.

The lady sho listened to my story thanked me

nicely,

hung up, and didnt even ask my name.

Since I was interested enough to call in the

first place, I would certainly like to know what

happened, if anything; especially if some reward.

is involved!

*

As a retired Federal' analyst, I am very familiar

with the way many Government agencies do not

always answer their mail, unless of course some

Congressional interest is 'being shown, but I will

optimistically look forward to some sort of an

answer anyway:

Cooper Search

The statute

of

limitations is

about to expire on D.B. Cooper and

his $200,000 ransom, and the FBI is

willing to pay $5,000 to the first

person to turn in one of the $20 bills

he stole.

Cooper was the man who

hijacked a

Northwest

Airlines

Boeing 727 flying from Portland to

Seattle on Nov. 24, 197), by giving a

stewardess a note claiming he had

a bomb in his suitcase.

Cooper's ransom was $200,000

from the airline, and he parachuted

into a raging thunderstorm from

the let's rear door somewhere

between Seattle and Reno, Nev.

No one is sure Cooper survived

the jump, and no trace of him has

lever been found.

The FBI, aware that statute of

limitations will expire at midnight,

Nov. 24, 1976, continues the hunt.

A plan has been devised to try

and recover the 10,000 $20 bills, if

• any have shown up, but it Isn't

being well received.

The plan involves nationwide

publishing of the serial numbers of

the bills. The person who turns in

the first bill would get $5.000

reward. Smaller rewards would be

given to persons who turned in bills

later.

The FBI says,

however, that

even if Cooper beats the rap, he

won't be able to go public. The IRS

believes Cooper owes back taxes

amounting to $218,000, which in-

cludes interest and penalties, for

his plunder.

stated that that newspaper would be happy

to cooperate in the plan should it materialize and he raised

the question of how many bait bill numbers would have to be

published. He explained it would be very tedious, cumber-

some and expensive to print and publish the list of bait

bills if it was an extensive list. He explained that the

paper has an offset printing press and that. if the FBI

•numbers would be simple and involve little or no expense to

the newspaper.

He reiterated that his paper would be happy to

cooperate in the plan if and when it materializes.

RECOMMENDAFION

If the plan as set out in re memo is initiated, it

is recommended that "offset proofs", be prepared in advance

to facilitate publication of the bait bills.

It is noted that the "Bremerton Sun" is the leading

He then ordered the remaining crew members

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a southerly

For the information of the Minneapolis Division,

the enclosed lists were disseminated as suggested in referenced

of this

It is not clear from information contained in

referenced communication as to the insurance company's position

Timing is critical if

this new program is-to be implemented; therefore, if anything

Representatives from receiving offices were in

attendance at the Norjak seminar held at San Francisco,

4/8-9/76, where a suggestion was made to institute a pub-

licity campaign for release in early November, 1976, widely

publicizing a revard for any twenty-dollar bill turned in

from the ranson list published in various media periodicals

and possible local newspapers.

This suggestion was approved

at FBIIQ and efforts to initiate appropriate groundwork

steps are now being taken. .

Receiving offices should, at this time, contact

major newspapers

within their Divisions in an effort to

determine if first they would particpate in this publicity

venture by printing on a one-time, daily, or weekly basis

the list of

ransom bill serial numbers and second if they'

agree to printing these, is there a particular form in

which the numbers could be provided to facilitate easier

Newspaper officials should be advised

that calls from individuals concerning the fact that they

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 1-76

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASBINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 15, 1976

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS

RE: COMPUTER SUPPORT TO THE FIELD

The main thrust of our computer support effort in the past has been directed at administrative

and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) matters. It is now my desire to concentrate more on ways

our computers can support the Agent in the Field. This is to make you aware of the computer services

that are presently available to you.

The Data Processing Section (DPS) of the Computer Systems Division is responsible for

working with the Field on investigative matters. Agents with specialized backgrounds have been assigned

to this Section and will assist you if some aspect of a case lends itself to computerization. This might be

a large volume of records (e.g., checks, cash receipts, purchase orders, personnel records, payroll

records, telephone numbers, etc.) that require sequencing, comparing or calculating, to disclose

misappropriations, kiting, lapping, skimming, padding of payrolls, identities of suspects, conspiracies,

etc. If you think the work can be performed more practically on the computer, you should contact the

DPS.

The DPS also offers assistance in the following areas:

1. Printing records that are in computer form (e.g-, records on computer tapes,

disks or cards).

2. Assistance in writing search warrants for, and conducting searches of, computer

installations.

3. Assistance in writing subpoenas for computer records.

4. Assistance in auditing computer records.

5. Assistance in interviewing computer personnel (e.g., computer analysts,

programmers, operators, etc.).

6. Computerized Telephone Number File (CTNF) services which will resequence

telephone numbers to facilitate setting leads and identifying subscribers.

7. Special searches of the NCIC current files or previous records, in addition

to the normal NCIC service.

The DPS is ready to assist the Field in all future major cases. DPS has developed a "Majos

Case Information System, " a prototype of which was used in the RESMURS Case. A similar system is

esently being used in the LAGBOM and ZAPBOM Cases. From this system, the Agent can more readi

termine what investigation has been conducted on the case, and what leads are still outstanding

The

system will also benefit the Agent when writing reports, answering inquiries, controlling physical evidence

Part II, Section 3 (pages 28 and 29) of the Manual of Rules and Regulations sets forth the wa

o request computer support services for investigative matters. I encourage you to take full advantage ol

this service.

Recently in connection with the Norjak case, the

Department of Justice has been attempting to detormine if the

Federal Statute of Limitations (five years) will apply to the

unknown suotect of captioned hijacking, and 11 in fact it does

apply, then

Is it at this time, feasible to consider obtaining

a "JOhn Doe" indictment.

In an effort to completely review all pertinent

evidence obtained and determine its present value If unknown

subjoct was identified and brought to trial now or within the

last three to five years, as well as, to determine if there is

enough individually identifiable information in our possession

to have a basis for obtaining a "John Doe" indictment, a

Norjak conference will commence April 8, 1976, 8:30 a.II,, at

the SEo.

All roceiving offices will send appropriate

representatives insuring they possess complete Inowledge of

all investigative aspects of captioned case conducted within

their respective division and a general overall insight into

all investigation conducted to date.

Lach representative will

be expocted to offer suggestions as to new directions in which

this investigation might proceed and/or furnish information

to insure that all logical investigation has been conducted.

It is absolutely necessary that we insure all investigative

avenues have been 100 per cent exhausted.

It is

own words.

Would it be possible to have copies of those

phone messages that dealt with such matters as the locations

lof explosives, leasing and dispatch of STOL aircraft, etc.?

Undoubtedly valuable psycholinguistic clues would be.involved

in these instructions. Is it possible any of these calls

were tape recorded?

I appreciate this opportunity for informal association.

ReBuairtel 1/2/73 to Seattle, Denver, and Minneapolis.

The color sketch prepared of Unsub in captioned case,

which is marked "B" and dated 1/2/73, is considered by Exhibits

Section at this date to be the best likeness obtainable from descriptive

data available. The original artist's sketch, with and without sunglasses

and designated as "A" sketch, was a black and white rendering of Unsub

prepared immediately following hijacking. Subsequently the color sketch,

with and without sunglasses, was developed and marked as "B" sketch.

Although a divergence of opinion regarding certain characteristics has

appeared in descriptions given by the various witnesses, the consensus

indicates that a good likeness of Unsub is shown by the artist's sketch

and that the "B" sketch with the added dimension of color more accurately

shows the Unsub's age and overall likeness.

In view of the numerous contacts with the witnesses who

supplied the descriptive data from which the sketch was prepared and

the lapse of time since they observed the hijacker, it is felt no construc-

tive purpose can be served by further attempts at modification based on

contact with these same witnesses.

She stated

the only suggestion she would have le that the nose should be

slightly smaller and not as tough or lumpy looking. She also

stated that the mouth of the individual she observed on this

flight did not appear quite as full, in other words, was.

"a older looking mouth". She indicated she would define

also aboard Flight 305,

stated that she believed sketch "B"

is more similar to the appearance of Unknown Subject than the

earlier black and white and colored sketches. She stated

that in her opinion, however, the current sketch was not a

vivid presentation of the appearance of Unknown Subject.

She did note that she observed the Unknown Subject fron the

ReSFairtel to Bureau dated 8/22/72, requesting

mats of the artist's

conception prepared in captioned matter

for use in obtaining more widespread publicity:

In accordance with the request of the Seattle

• Office 8/7/72, a color artist's conception was prepared

forwarded

to the Seattle Office.

To date the Bureau

has received no evaluation of this color sketch. Seattle'

request for mats will not be further considered

until the

Bureau receives an evaluation by the witnesses of the

color sketch.

For the information of the Seattle office,

commercial engravers charge $10 per 50 minutes plus

initial charge of $8 for a 4" x 5" plate.

These mats w111

only reproduce in black and white. Many publishers both

large and small presently use the offset printing process

which does not require a mat.

The Seattle Office should promptly coordinate

review of the Bureau's color sketch for the purpose of

evaluation. If it is deemed advisable that the mats

be prepared, resubmit your recommendation.

this flight with a twenty dollar bill and had no luggage.

He occupied seat number 18t on the aircraft and prior to

the

time the aircraft taxied on the runway, he purchased a

bourbon and T-up with a twenty dollar bill from Stewardoss

The aircraft left Portland at 2:53 p.i.,

unsub turned

an envelope

was on plain white unlined paper and written in neat,

handvriting.

This note informed Stevardess

that

he had a bomb

Unsub then dictated to her his demands*

at the

conclusion

of which he remarked, "No. fuss."

Stewardess

showed Stewardess

the demand notes

and then went to the cockpit where she displayed them to the

captain of the aircraft.

The unsub retrieved these notes

prior to the time the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington.

She thereafter remained in the cockpit where she prepared

thirteen pages of notes concerning the hijacking and in which

she described unsub as in his fifties.

REWARD:

This case

has generated world-wide attention and

many suspects have been suggested and are continuing

"to be received.

However, since nothing of value has yet been

developed, it is felt that the prospect of a substantial

reward for information leading to the identification and

conviction of this hijacker, might entice someone to come

'forward and name the hijacker.

To be realistic, the reward would have to be

attractive to the person furnishing the information and

therefore, a sum of not less than $25,000 is recommended.

The reward money could be provided either by the

Department of justice, or by the airlines, or by both. The

only reward at the moment is $5,000, offered by the Seattle,

SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES: Since nothing. was found in the, search

conducted by the Army in March and

ARTIST'S SKETCH

A review of the testinony of the principal

witnesses, including the 3 stewardesses, the 2 Northwest

Airline employees (NIA) at Portland, Oregon, and the 5

passengers roflests a goneral disagreement oncerning the

accuracy of the artict's bketch. Huerous changes were sub-

gested by these witnesses and some were implimented in

maling up the final artist's ckeich.

It is noted that a

Burcau artist perconally interviewed the three stewardesses

a& ninneapolis,

hinnesota and thereatter prepared & re-

vised sketch of the hijacker showing him with the dark glasses,

which he wore on the airplane, and another sketch, but

without the glasses.

One key withese, L

stewardess, was very adament in her insistence that the

artist's conception was not a very good likeness of the

hijacker.

DESCRIPTIVE DATA

MATCHBOOK COVER

Regarding the blue mitchbook cover marked "Sky Chef"

observed by Stewardess [

Jas used by the hi-

jacker, it should be noted that sky Chef is a chain of

restaurants serving airports.

It is reconmended that

Portland determine if there is a Sky Chef Restaurant at the

Portland Airport (noting that the Sky Chef Restaurants usually

have different names) and Portland should determine if this

restaurant gives away blue colored matchbooks with Sky

Chef written on them. Ungub may have eaten lunch at the

Portland Airport Restaurant prior to boarding Northwest

Airlines flight 305 and if so, latent fingerprints may be

on a neal ticket (bill) for that day. Portland should

determine if these tickets are available for Novenber 24,

1971, and deternine feasibility of obtaining latents.

OLIVE OP LATIN COMPLEXION

Key witnesses generally agree that unsub had an

"olive or Latin" complexion.

One witness indicated a

Mexican-American or possibly Indian complexion and

characteristics.

In addition, unsub expressed a desire to

go "anywhere in Mexico".

It is recommended that all divisions having a

concentration of lexican-American extremists, including

Chicanos, Broin Berets, review extremists albums. It is

further

suggested that revised colored sketches, when

obtained, be shown to all pertinent Mexican-American sources.

ACTING DIRECIOR, FBI (164-2111)

Captioned major case occurred almost six months ago

and still remains unsolved. All indications pointed to the fact

that the unknown subject parachuted near LaCenter, lashington;

however, an extensive ground search of the area and investigation

have failed to identify or locate the hijacker.

You must non approach the investigative aspect of this

important unsolved major case with a fresh approach.

The files

should be thoroughly and objectively reviened, serial by serial,

by alert personnel who have proven to be tireless, imaginative,

and "street wise" investigators. To assist in this file review

you may wish to consider utilizing the services of personnel who

have not been "wrapped up" in this case fron its inception. In

your file review insure that all matters that have been brought

to your attention in this case have been completely resolved and

that none were overlooked or left hanging.

Within ten days of receipt of this communication,

advise the Bureau what steps and avenues you intend to tale

in order to identify and locate the unknown subject.
