The following investigation was conducted by SA

b7C

Pro-

bation and Parole Office, Eugene, Oregon, advised that his

office was in possession of information concerning an indi-

vidual who closely resembled the unknown subject in this

the probation file of MERLIN GENE COOPER, who had served a

two-year term in the Oregon State Prison (OSP) at Salem,

Oregon, on charges of obtaining money by false pretenses.

A review of this file disclosed that in 1967 COOPER

had been arrested for writing a no account check at an es-

tablishment in Roseberg, Oregon.

COOPER was subsequently

tried and convicted on a charge of obtaining money by false

pretenses and sentenced to two years in the OSP.

This file

further indicates that from 1952 to 1956 COOPER served as

a member of the U. S. Air Force where his military occupa-

tional specialty was control tower operator-air traffic

controller. The file indicates that as of 1969 COOPER was

1, Oregon. At that time

Medical records and evaluations

contained in COOPER'S

file

indicate that he has an IQ of 117, placing him in the

superior mentality range.

Medical evaluation indicates

COOPER's principal problem resulted from excessive drinking;

however, at times when he was sober, COOPER was characterized

as being an intelligent and likable person. The file further

indicated that in addition to his sentence at OSP, COOPER

had served several years in the Wisconsin State Penitentiary

there is sensin.

His penitentiary identification number

The last entry in COOPER's file indicates that as

of June l1, 1969, he was employed as a salesman for Nimrod

Camper Center, Eugene, Oregon, and was residing at 3906 Frank-

lyn Boulevard, Eugene.

The following descriptive data was obtained from

COOPER's probation file:

1. The heavy dashed line G-D-E-s defines the airplane's probable ground track.

2. Line G-I-J-K defines the westammost, and Line LaM-N-O the casterrimost

probable airplane ground tracks based on the stated position tolerance of $.5

3. Lines AB, H-P, and O-R are the average wind weetors between 10,000' MSL and the

4. Line H-g-T defings the northornmost (earliest) points over which the HJ probably

the HJ probably left tise airplane. The norti-south span of possible jump positions

is a produet of the radar position tolerence of t.5 mile, and the postible communicaton

time determination tolerance of ½1 minute.

5, The ares within the boundary defined by Folnts M-P-Q-R-O-K-J-I-H marks the

extreme limite of probable landing points based on the aboys tolerances. That Is, assuming

the highest probable degres of inaccuracy in aircraft position, lump time, wind vector, ets.,

all probable HJ landing points would lie within the area defined by this line.

since it would be a maximum of 2600' along the airplane's track if the HJ free

fell all the way to the ground in the "least drag" (tusked) position.)

b. if the chute was opened without damogs immediately after the J left the airplane,

he would drift with she wind along Line A-8 and would land at Point &. The more

expert he was, the longer he would probably free-fall (to limit his drift with the wind).

The lowest probable altitude to which he would frec-fail la 2600' MSL. If he free

feil to 2600' MSL, his landing would be at Point U.

Based on the above, the most favorable search areas. listed in their order of priority, would

be as followai

- At Point A.

- Along Line A-&, livoring the segment between U and B.

- South of Line A-B.

- North of Line A-B.

In addition to the sbove, the following are pertinent:

- The landing point is more likely to be south of line A-B, and it is more likely to be

in the northwest portion of area A-B-A-O-K-J-A than in the southed it portion

thereof,

- It is cubetamdaily let Ilkely that the landing point is norch of Line A-B, If it is,

the most probable point is south of the Lewis River, and in the south we

of the area defined by Point A-B-l-swA,

The attached plot indicates the envelope of possible landing points of the high jacker (HS).

It is based on the following:

- Aircraft position from USAF radar data from McChord AFB furnished by

• Probable jump time (0411 GMT) from an analysis of the recorded communication

from the flight relative to the cabin pressure fluctuation. Flight tests conducted

on January 6 confirmed that the pressure fluctuation almost certainly occurred at

the time the HJ left the airplane.

- Human body traiectories from data furnished by The Boeing Company (free-falt)

who is an expert para

and L

chutist.

- Time correlation from the above USAF radar information and from the NWA

communications network tape recording.

— Airplane airspeed and altitude from the airplane's flight recorder.

The plot is explained as follows:

1. The heavy dashed line C-D-E-S defines the airplane's probable ground track.

2. Line G-1-J-K defines the westernmost, and Line L-M-N-O the easternmost

probable airplane ground tracks based on the stated position tolerance of $.5

nautical mile of the USAF radar plot.

3. Lines A-B, H-P, and O-R are the average wind vectors between 10,000' MSL and the

ground, and are the lines parallel to which the HJ would drift after the parachute had

opened.

4. Line H-S_T defines the northernmost (earliest points over which the HJ probably

left the airplane. Line K-F-O defines the southernmost (latest) points over which

the HJ probably left the airplane. The north-south span of possible jump positions

is a product of the radar position tolerance of .5 mile, and the possible communication

time determination tolerance of 1 minute.

5. The area within the boundary defined by Points H-P-Q-R-O-K-J-1-H marks the

extreme limits of probable landing points based on the above tolerances. That is, assuming

the highest probable degree of inaccuracy in aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, etc.,

all probable HJ landing points would lie within the area defined by this line.

6. If it is assumed aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, and other inputs used are all

accurate (without allowance for the above stated tolerances):

a. The HJ's landing point would be at Point A if his 'chute did not open, or if he

opened it so soon that the high speed caused 'chute damage that resulted in the

equivalent of a free-fall to the ground. (The horizontal body trajectory due to

it being at the same speed as the airplane at the moment of exit, has been ignored

since it would be a maximum of 2600' along the airplane's track if the HJ free-

fell all the way to the ground in the "least drag" (tucked) position.)

b. If the 'chute was opened without damage immediately after the HJ left the airplane,

he would drift with the wind along Line A-B and would land at Point B. The more

expert he was, the longer he would probably free-fall (to limit his drift with the wind).

The lowest probable altitude to which he would free-fall is 2500' MSL. If he free-

fell to 2500' MSL, his landing would be at Point U.

Based on the above, the most favorable search areas, listed in their order of priority, would

be as follows:

- At Point A.

- Along Line A-B, favoring the segment between U and B.

- South of Line A-B.

- North of Line A-B.

In addition to the above, the following are pertinent:

- The landing point is more likely to be south of Line A-B, and it is more likely to be

in the northwest portion of area A-B-R-O-K~J-A than in the southeast portion

thereof.

- It is substantially less likely that the landing point is north of Line A-B. If it is,

the most probable point is south of the Lewis River, and in the south west portion

of the area defined by Points A-B-/—J—A.

i but i in is he possible it he landit point no in of the emis

by Points O-M-V-I-H-P-Q.

If there are any questions relative to the above, they should be referred to the under-

signed.

RE:

Tour No, 164-41

Dear Sir:

I am enclosing a Xeroxed copy of a mug of James Wayne Wallace, F.B.I. No. 855 301 D,

Oregon State Bureau of Identification ID No. 244931.

This picture was taken nearly ten

years ago and I have not seen Wallace in over five years. Information gathered on him

in 1963 put him at 5'10", and 160 Ibs. His hair was dark brown and his eyes were brown.

D.O.B. 11.2.39 at Gorhan, Illinois.

Wallace was supervised on parole by this office until 9.28.70 at which time he was dis-

charged. At the time, he was employed by Thompson Metal Fabrication, 2054 N. Vancouver

and living at 1030 N.E. 102 Avenue, Apt. 13.

I realize there are some discrepancies in age and description. However, Wallace's 1962

mug shot (especially the original) will show some substantial facial similarities.

Although I know of no parachuting or airplane experience in his background, he always

impressed me as a fellow who had a fair bit of intestinal fortitude.

I hope this will be of some assistance.

Re: UNKNOVN SUBJECT WHO HIJACKED NORTHWEST ORIENT

OREGON, AND SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, ON NOVEMBER

Enclosed for your office is an artist's sketch

and on the back of the sketch a description of the

individual who hijacked the Northwest Orient Airlines

aircraft on November 24, 1971.

The hijacker is very possibly a person who has

disappeared from his usual abode and possibly from his job.

Your assistance is requested in identifying persons who

have been missing since about the time the hijacking occurred

and who could fit the description of this individual.

I would gretly appreciate your furnishing

information regarding persons known to your agency who

have been missing recently and who could be considered

suspects in this case.

In the event you have no pertinent information as

to missing persons, please reply on this communication

stating a check of your records was negative.

It is our

desire to

receive a response from all to whom this letter

is sent.

CONSIDER UNKNOWN SUBJECT ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

Thank you for your assistance.

INFORMATION FOR NEWS MEDIA

Intensive Investigation is still being conducted

by the FBI and law enforcement to identify and apprehend

the individual responsible for hijacking a Northwest Orient

Airlines Boeing 727 aircraft on the afternoon of November 24,

1971, between Portland and Seattle. This person extorted

$200,000 from Northwest Orient Airlines, and all the money

was turned over to the hijacker in $20 bills. Serial

numbers of all the bills have been recorded, and a list

of the serial numbers has been furnished to all banks and

police agencies in this area.

Your cooperation is solicited in encouraging your

listeners or subscribors to examine $20 bills coming into

their possession in substantial numbers or under unusual

circunstances and check the serial numbers against the

ransom lists on file at banks, police agencies, and the

FBI Office.

If you desire a list of the serial numbers, please

advise and the list will be immediately furnished to you.

Whatever coverage you are able to give this matter

will indeed be appreciatod.
