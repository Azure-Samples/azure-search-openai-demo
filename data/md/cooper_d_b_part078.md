BOISE :

1. Line G-I-K-M represents the airplane's flight path as it approachoci

the Portland (PDX) VOR.

2. The cabin pressure "bump" occurred at 0410 GiT, the time being i-

corded by the NiA Flight Operations Office (NAFO) in Minneapoll:.

It is a virtual certainty that the pressure

"bump" marks the tir!

flat the high-jacker (hJ) left the airplane. The airplane was et

Point A at that time, thus the HJ's body would land at Point A i1

I in 'chutes did not open (unlikely).

3. If it is assumed that the HiJ was a highly expert parachutist; and

would thus free-fall as far as practicable to insure the bost accuie.

acy of his touchdown point, he would land slightly to the NE of

Point A due to his drifting with the wind from the point of 'chut

opening.

4. II the #J opened his 'chute as soon as he left the airplans, he

, Lould drift along the line A-B and would touch down at B. All

lines parallel to A-B are lines along which the HJ would drift

,if he opened his 'chute relativaly early.

5. The parallelogram indicated by C-D-F-E represents the boundaries

*of the probable touchdown area adjusted for possible time errors

and for the above described wind drift. It is probably the most

fruitful search area.

6. The earliest the HJ could bave jumped is 0406, and this point is

represented by Point G.

7. The crew believes the pressure "bump" occurred at 0410, but in

any even are certain it occurred before 0415.

If the hJ, jumped

at 0406 (unlikely) he would land on or near line G-H. If he

jumped at 0415 he would land on or near line MN.

8. Erded on tha. above explanation of Figure 1, and on all the assump.

tions based in its preparation, the following are pertinent:

The most likely landing point for the HJ is at, or slightly NE

of Point A.

b. His landing point is more likely to be in area C-D-F-E than

any other.

It is possible his landing point could be anywhere within the

arca shown (G-H-N-M), but the probability goes down as the

ends of this area are approached.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date December 15, 1972

Horthwest Airlines, Inc.,

_ Minnesota, advised as follows:

involved a Boeing 727, a tri-jet.

the rear stairs facing the pilots cockpit, there are panels

which open on the right and left sides of

the aircraft.

These panels can be opened and the panel on the right side

has sufficient room for two average-sized males.

The panel

on the left side has sufficient room for one average male.

However, these panels cannot be entered unless the

stairs are 100 per cent down.

In his opinion these panels

could not be entered at all while the aircraft is in flight,

even though the stairs are partially decended.

Under the best conditions while the aircraft is on

the ground, it is a difficult matter for an individual with-

out assistance to enter these panels and then re-close the

doors. In his opinion, it would be practically impossible

for the unknown subject to have entered and concealed himself

in either one of these compartments.

She was

to Northwest Airlines Flight 305, that was hijacked between

Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, on November 24,

1971. She had previously related to Special Agents of the

FBI at Seattle all details that she could recall concerning

the hijacker, and understood that the purpose of this inter-

view was to assist in the preparation of an artist's concep-

tion of the hijacker, by answering certain questions regarding

the best recollection she has as of this time of the hijacker.

described the hijacker generally as a white

male, age 38-45, olive complexion, height 73 inches, weight

165-170 pounds, slim build, and hair dark brown or black.

She was unable to describe his eyes as he wore hore-rimmed

dark glasses at all times she observed him while aboard the

flight, and she further pointed out that L

When questioned further to further define various

characteristics of the hijacket, she described his head as

oval, eyes unknown, eyebrows average, nose small, mouth small,

thick lower lip, thin upper lip, chin pointed, ears average,

cheek and cheekbone average, hair straight, and slightly

balding. She could not make any comment concerning facial

lines, and said he did not have a moustache, beard or pockmarks

was then exhibited a "Facial Identification

Catalog," depicting various types of heads, eyes, etc., and

thereafter picked the following identified

photos as being

best representative in her opinion, of the hijacker: Head -

KA3-9, Eyes - unknown, Eyebrows

- OC1-10, Nose - 0D4-1,

mouth KE9-11, Chin KF3-17, Ears - KGI-12, Cheek and cheekbone -

suggest any particular number for facial lines, moustache,

beard or pockmarks and skin irregularities.

Iwas subsequently exhibited a facsimile copy

of an artist's conception, based on information furnished to

the artist by Stewardess

I Her first comment

upon viewing this drawing was,

"That's him"; however, she

later made the following suggestions, which in her opinion

would make the drawing a closer likeness to the hijacker:

the man depicted is too young; the hair-line is good, but

the hair should be thinner. His ears were slightly smaller

in the fleshy area, and not so squared off. The nose should

be thinner. Mouth - bottom lip is good but not quite so wide;

more hollow below cheekbone and jaw. Chin possibly smaller.

In addition to the above,

had made the

following additional comments concerning the hijacker:

His clothing consisted of dark pants, white shirt,

stewardess, Northwest Orient

then at Northwest's Operations,

informed as follows:

On viewing a facsimile copy of an artist's con-

ception of the hijacker on Northwest Flight 305, on November

24, 1971, she stated that the conception was not, in her

opinion, a good likeness of the hijacker. She requested

permission to examine the Facial Identification Catalog,

and immediately picked out photo number KK5-1, in the Facial

Lines Section, stating, "that is him, except for the ears

and haix."

She explained that the person depicted in that

particular number photo closely resembled the man; however,

the ears of the hijacker did not protrude as far from the

head, and she felt that the hair line should be some lower

than that on the man depicted in photo number KK5-1. She

was very adamant in her insistence that the artist's con

ception shown to her was not a good likeness of the hijacker.

SUBJECT:

NORJAK

DATE:

4/10/72

SAC EARL MIINES, Seattle Division, telephonically

advised at 4:15 p.m., this date, that important

information has been received indicating that it is

entirely possible that the highjacker of the United

to the subace at sapt one city, Uta stated ehat the

to the subject of captioned case.

Salt Lake City subject's picture

to the artist's conception previously prepared on the

NORJAR subject.

SAC MILNES requested that l

Northwest Airlines, he

contacted for the following information:

He requested that all tickets for flights

from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, and

Seattle, Washington, to Portland, Oregon, for the perioc

11/10/71 through 11/24/71 be checked to see whether

any of them were listed under the folloving names:

RICHARD FLOYD MC COY

R. MC COY

D. COOPER OI DAN COOPER

He stated that it had been determined that the

subject of the Salt Lake City case had made a trial run a

week prior to this highjacking, and it was the opinion

of those at the Bureau that possibly the NORJAK subject

did the same thing.

If any ticket coupons are located

under any of the above names all pertinent information regarding

the flight should be checked out. This matter is to

receive immediate attention.

PROFJIB

Thi purpose of the folioning inforction io to

conveniently liat all the know facts concerning

the hi-

jacker's profile and to conbine thon with suppositions that

can be recconably inferred fron those facts.

The

suppositions

have boch

included to aid in processing a suspect.

They

nould not be considurod as concrete sucts, nor should chie

se used as the solu detorminins factor in dravint investi

gative conclusions.

SUMMARY

Unsub was a well spoken, concervative gentlemen;

probably a Catholic with Mexican

1 or Indian blood. He wai

alcoholic.

He probably lived in the Portland or

Scuttle aroi; or had flown none than once over these arars.

Re

apperontly had

no accouplies.

He ves not an

skydiver and

probably roceived his jump training

the majitary.

His hijacking plan was

not well thought out,

and he ras probably not an coperianced criminal. He was

apparently having firanoial trombles prior to Novembar,

1971, and he nay have previously worked in an airline-

related indus iry.

The reasons for the above suppositions are in

cluded below.

BACKGROUND.

It is felt Unsuh was not an experienced orininal

because of his nannorisin exhibited after he receivud the

ranson money.

Unsub reportedly became solowhat childich

in his actions and comments while counting the money.

Unsub was familian with the Seuttle area, as

indicated by his contents concenning the plane's location

as it flew ovor Tacona, Weshington.

In addition, Unsub

made a commont as to the distanco loChoni Air Forco Baco

in relation to Sea-Tac Airport.

Unsub reportedly

indicated MoChord was approxinately 20 minutes 1 On

Sea-Tac, which is cosentally correct.

the prudie may be

associated with his backpround

which could pos. bly

be Indian, Mexican on poscibly

Italian descent. Note unsub has been described by with os

as definitaly having, some Mexican or Indian

"blood" in him.

It is noted the northwest arca at the

time of the

hijacking was suffuring from a depressed economic condition,

and since Unsub

was familiao with the Seattle

in-

dicated above, it is posthle Unsub was out of work at the

time of NORJAK.

In addition, Unsub demonstrated consid: rable

Knowledge of aircraft and of

flyins; and it is felt he was

employed in the aircraft indusin, either civilian or

military at ons tire in his life, thorofore, it is lurial

to assume unsub

may ponsibly

• have bech out

of work in an

airlines-related industry.

His actions and reactions that occurred throw hout

the hijacking indicate unrub

probably was not

a desporcie

mans non was he mentally ill such as a paranoid tyre.

Unsub

exhibited an unusually calm manner throughout the whole

hijacking.

Unsub was probably a "Ioner" and carried out ie

hijacking by hinself, with no partners.

Throurhout the

hijacking, he exhibited a competency in reacting to various

situations that arose.

It is belioved that Unsub was nut

an experienced crininal, but a victim of circumstances.

Unsub's physical build and his handiness with the

parachute shroud linco

indicates coordination

and some

physical ahility as will as inventivoness.

(It is noted

that during the hijacking unsub requested

a knapsack to put

the money in and he received

a small white bas instead.

Unsubs took a small pocket knife fron his person and

fashioned a moans to attach the amall bar to his body u.ing

profane language.

3.

Throughout the hijacking he maintained a calm

Synopsis:

CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT - HLUACKING; EXTORTTON

On November 24, 1971, a white male akyjacked a North-

vest Airlines, Flight fron Portland to

Scattle. The

hijacker demunded and received s200,000 and four pura-

chutes upon landing at Séattle-Táccma Internationai

Airport.

After receiving

the ranson

money, the hijncker

allowed

the passensers to

leave..

The plane then trok

off for Reno and at 8:l1. p.n. a pressure oscillation

was noted. by

the plane's crev.

That pressure oscillation

was probably caused by the hijacker leaving the ai'craft.

Search of the aircraft at Reno revealed the hijackrz:

was not in the plane when it landed. 'Extensive se.rches

of the area into which the hijacker kould have landed

• failed to locate the lijacker op any evidence of value.

The initial black and white artist corposite drawing

of the hijacker vas chanred to a color slietch to nure

accurately reflect the hijacker's age and suarthy

complexion.

FIRST TERRAIN SEARCH

The purpose of the first terrain search was to

search for possible evidence left behind by Unsul and to

find the remains of Unsub assuming he made an unsuccessful

jump.

The first terrain search commenced at 2:00 PM on

March 21, 1972 with 218 Arny troops including officers,

20 Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and 9 helicopters.

The area to be searched covered approxi-

mately 25 square miles.

Due to snowfall in search area on March 25, 1972,

the search was temporarily held up. Army troops remained

on location and the search resumed at 12:00 Noon on

March 26, 1972.

The search was temporarily discontinued

at 12:00

Noon March 30, 1972 to allow search personnel to

enjoy the Easter Holiday.

with 265 Army personnel and 20 Agents.

Remaining

areas to be searched were reached only by helicopter in-

sention of search personnel and landing zones in most

cases were under 6 to 12 inches of snow.

The search of the entire area was completed at

1:00 PM, April 17, 1972 with nothing found.

HUNTERS SEARCH

Prior to the 1972 hunting season, the following

information was made available to Washington State Game

Wardens

who

supervise the area into which the hijacker

parachuted:

"On November

24, 1971, a man parachuted into the

below-described area with

$200,000 in $20 bills. If, while

camping or hunting, you should discover any evidence con-

cerning this skyjacking please contact the nearest FBI

SECOND TERRAIN SEARCH

In attempt to determine the accuracy of the first

search area, the following was learned:

The first search area was calculated using a

system of plotting known as "GEOREF" (i.e. Geographical

Reference) which has a plotting error of plus or minus

mile. A new plotting system using a computer generated

latitude

and longitude has a plotting encor of plus or

minus 1/2 mile.

The time of jump is known, and an area

approximately one mile by seven miles represents the ance

Unsub would have landed in if his parachute did not open.

Because some of the above corridor fell in the

old on first terrain search area, only an area 2 miles by

1/2 mile was searched during the second terrain search.

The second terrain search commenced March 12,

1973, and involved 10 Special Agents of the Seattle Office.

It was temporarily interrupted on March 16 and resumed again

March 26, 1973.

The second terrain

search was completed March 29,

FIRST SKYJACKING UTILIZING PARACHUTES

In an effori to doternine the origin of the

D.B. COOPER hijacking (i.e, the original idea behind the

skyjack pian)

, a reVieW was

conducted of the magazine and

newspaper articles written just prior to WORJAK.

The below quoted newspaper article described the

first known skyjacking, in which a parachute was used by

the skyjacker.

The Seattle Tines, Novenber 13, 1971:

"Calgary, Alberta - (UPI) - A maskod hyjacker

carrying more than

40 pounds of dynamite was knocked un-

conscious today by

an Air Canada crerman wielding a fire ax.

The creuman's action 3,000 feet in the air ended a six-

hour hijacking which skipped back and forth over the United

States - Canadian border.

"The hijacker, reported in fair condition todny

with a possible skull fracture, was putting on a parachute

to bail. out of the DCS over Calgary when he was struck by

the

ax.

"The hijacker, carrying a "shotgun in-addition to

dynamite, took control last night of the Calgary to

Montreal Flight cannying 123 persons. Claiming to be e menber

of the Irish Republican Armys

the men demanded $1.5 million

and a free passage

to Ireland. • (A touring I.R.A. spokesman

denied that the hijacker belonged to the I.R.A.)

"After landing in Great Falls, Montana, the nan

accepted $50,000 ransom.

The plane took off, landed arain

it Great Falls, and the

let the passengers to unharned.

But, he ordered the plane with its five-member crew to take

again.

Indecision on the part of the hijacker led

the plane

back and forth across the border before he an-

parently decided to jump.

"An Air Canada official

said that as the hijucker

was preparing to jump, the pilot,

The above-described attache case supposedly contrined

a bomb. It is believed Unsub threw this attache case fron

the plane prior to his jumping, because of the nunerous other

items he had to carry.

If he did throw it prior to jumping,

it would fall almost directly in the path of the aircraft.

been sugsested that infrared photography might possibly

indicate non-living material, such as an attache case, in

darker shade than living material, thereby enabling the case

to be found using infrared high resolution photography.

Since Unsub possibly. discarded the attache case

prior to jumpin, he could not have buried or hidden it.

The case would have dropped directly in the flight path of

the plane and could possibly be visible from the air. the

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or any

other time is limited to 33 minutes, and therefore the arca

covered is relatively snall when compared to the entire

Donald W. Nyrop, President.

Northwest Orient Airlines.

Dear Sir;

Whether you believe the following information, and how I came to obtain it is a

matter for you to decide. By rejecting the information, you are still minus $250,000 and a

maniac that has motivated hijacking and mass murdering aboard Airlines.

I am in no way affiliated with EVIL, or the hijacker "D.B. Copper." I am a man of

God, and when the times comes, you will know just how close I am wadingxuttilast walking with

God. For the time being, we will let it stand, and get to the point.

"D"B. Cooperl ordered the aircraft to circle SEA-TAC airport, as you well know.

You also know,

although it is not general public information, that a tape recorder had been

found that had been issuing orders to the pilot long after "Cooper" jumped. What you do not know,

(but God knows) is WHBRE he jumped, and the disposition of the money. His letter to you sometime

ago was a payahotginas psychological blunder, pointing out the fact that he lost the money bag

after jumping from the aircraft, due to the force of the wind ripping it out of his hand. Before

I reveal the locality of the ransom money, (and I can pinpoint the sp ot where you can recover

it!) let me fill you in as to "Cooper's" IXOXEX plan of operation. In the first place, he had

an accomplice, whom I will reveal a little later. "Cooperl as you have suspected, is a

jumper" for the National Forest Service. The very name "D.B. Cooper" means, Double Back (to)

C ooper (Lake)!")

When the aircraft circled around above Sea-Tac Airport, "Cooper" bailed out;

leaving the recorder running with directions, ete. He planned the jump so that the wind was

coning from the Southwest at a certain tate of speed, and would blow him toward the North-nortigasa

east! His plan was to land in Cooper Lake, not far from Salmon La Sac, a public camping area.

I have shared this information with the F.B.I. and also the Secret Service, Both

have stupidly ignored me, although it is the duty of the same to check all possible amgles, would-

n't you think? The Secret SErvice is so secret, I wonder if they know what is real? But that is

beside the point. It is just exasperation upon my part, so forgive me my ravings, will you?

Now to the meat of the subject, as I told the above "security" organizations:

I know the exact whereabouts of "D.B. Cooper" and his accomplice, and also the EXACT SPOT that

holds the money hidden from the human eye. I will go a little further and say that Cooper, who

is about 35 years of age, and slighty, or a little more so, liat bald, is enjoying the holidays

at his leisure with his accomplice, a very attractive ted-headed woman of about the same age

that has a miniature sized dog as a pet. (A check of the passenger list at the time of the hi-

jack, and the memory of one of the stewardesses will reveal this to you.) First things first!

on a dirt road on the east side of like Kachess, which is, by the way, a dead end road. When you

have captured them, and as God, even Jehovah the Father, is my witness, you will capture them,

and the maximum penalty of DEATH is too good for them, you will then contact me at the above

address, and I will lead you to the ransom money. I have tried several times to recover it, but

I now know why I have been unable to. "Cooper" left the very unstable plastic explosives in the

bag with the money, and only a qualified disposal man should handle it. when the bag is recover-

ed. The bag is slightly torn and a few bills are missing, but "Ya can't win 'em all!"

I am mailing a copy of this letter to a friend of mine,

the Sattle Post*Intelligencer, Inowing that he is an honest man, and that he will not foolishly bic

reveal this information for the same reason you won't. Skepticism, until proos positive has been

received. You have your information, and the rest is between you and God (if you believe God),

or between you and the Devil, (because he would have you disbelieve so that the murder and abomin

ations that are continuing to happen because of the desperado fame of this man has gone unchecked)

name, by the way,

and when thee even&s

have taken place, he is to have soul rights to the information and "Scoop." this is the will of

my Heavenly Father. It is also Jehovah's will that I receive the reward for Cooper, and also for

the ransom money, the total of which, as I believe, is $50,000. Along with that, out of the

FIRES

kindness of your heart, you will present me, as a messenger of God, with two honorary lifetime

God Bless you and good hunting; b6

Dear

Attached is correspondence indicating a solution to the

D.B. Cooper case, giving details for the location and ap-

prehension of the culprits involved, and the procedures

to obtain our $200,000.00.

Judging from this letter you can see that our president

is plagued with all kinds of cranks. Yet we will keep

accepting any information regarding this particular case

in the hope that sometime a piece of information will be

received that is factual and could aid in the solving of

this case.

As indicated, I do not believe there is any valid information

in the letter, but nonetheless we will pass it on to your

department so that you may further investigate it. No

stone should be left unturned in an attempt to solve this

crime.

At your convenience, please advise us what your evaluation

of this letter is.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and may you have

a successful New Year.

Yours very truly,

turned out, was mute and had to be

ideas behind the words, we were as-

He has also written plays about a

If there's one thing that typifies Or-

through logic right off the wall, often

into surprisingly tender emotions.

Orlock, "in terms of holding an audi-

Orlock is a native of Philadelphia

and Boston University. He set out to

become an actor and director but

about nine years ago took a playwrit-

But he adds, "I think I'll walk away
