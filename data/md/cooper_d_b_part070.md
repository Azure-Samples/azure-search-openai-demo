Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution

SUBJECT: Partial human skeleton

The xemains include: skull vault lacking almost all occiput, left vertex

to nose root, face; vertebrae 63, Ill and 12, b3, left ribs # 1 - 5, 9, 11,

right ribs # 5, 8 - 11 with some ends broken post-mortem; pelvis; left humerus,

right clavicle + scapula, fenora, right tibia and fibula, right talus. The

bone is generally tan color from soil staining (sandy dark soil with remains)

but the right lower extremity and. skull are sun-bleached white, indicating

decay in a partly sheltered wooded (?) area and scattering. Remnants of dried

ligaments at knees and a shred of scalp in the right vertex area contrast with

some weathering cracks and the beginning of spongy bone decay and suggest:

sharp temperature change in a rather dry area; this fits the animal gnawing

(rodents?) on right knee and left shoulder. Time since death may be from

under two to five years (conceivably more) if death in the cool season ex-

plains persistence of some soft tissue.

Sex criteria are male.

Age criteria are from 20 (skult) to L/ years.

Race appears White based on limb proportions, pelvis, and 2 wavy brown

hairs sticking to the scalp remnants.

Stature estimate is from 67 3/4 to 704" and build is average to slender.

Unfortunately there are no teeth for identification.

Possible identifying traits include: inward bowing of humerus; healed

fractures of front part of right ilium and of front lips of bearing surfaces

of right hip socket with consequent wear on the head-neck junction of the

femur by the labrum and/or the ring fibers of the capsule (the left side

shows a lesser degree of this same stress-wear, and a congenital obtuse

femur neck angle may contribute); the preserved two vertebrae from the

bottom end of the thoraicic sexies suggest a very slight lateral curve

with convexity to the left, and also show Schmorl herniations of the disks

into the vertebral bodies; the skull vault seems a bit small (but restoration

is uncertain).

Possibly the skeletal damage to back and right hip occurred in a single

accident (motorcycle? parachute-jumping?, a fall?) several years ago.

The fresh breaks of the shattered skull vault might in part have occurred

at death (or soon after). A "dent" near the cartilage end of left rib #4

and a 5 - 10° inward bending fracture of right rib 19 in the mid-axillary

line (but not on ribs 8 or 10) may also have occurred at death.

Chicago, Illinois,

advised his company is one of the largest mail order sport

parachuting equipment supply houses

in the United States.

He and l

have little direct

contact with their customers. He has

reviewed his files

and the name COOPER does not appear. '

advised he is from the Seattle area and

came to Chicago

one year ago. While in Seattle he sport

parachuted for six years. He stated he did not recall

having met anyone he felt could be identical to unknown

subject.

Istated in his opinion the person responsible

for the hijacking is not a sport parachutist.

He bases

this opinion on the theory that sport parachutists have

an emotional attachment to their equipment, and probably

would not periorm a jump with equipment not known to them.

From the accounts he read concerning the hijacking he

assumes the hijacker had military parachuting experience.

'ROBIN HOOD'

Despite some attempts to prove

otherwise through opportunism and

commercialism, the person who labels

himself as. "D. B. Cooper" is--if he is

still alive--no modern-day Robin Hood.

He is a thief and a criminal of the

highest order. He demonstrated more

than passing knowledge of the air en-

vironment, especially parachuting. It

is possible that "D. B. Cooper's" path

may have crossed that of airline per-

sonnel--and airline-pilots--at some

time under another name. He is re-

ported to have a bitter hatred agoinst

the airlines--he may have worked for

For these reasons PILOT BULLETIN

is printing the specifications of the

criminal that extorted $200,000 from

Northwest Airlines on Nov, 24, 1971.

Two artist drawings of "Cooper" are

included in the hopes they may prod

the memories of ALPA members who

may have seen or known him in the

past.

The Federal Bureau of Investigo-

Race: White

Age: Mid-40s

Artists sketch of Cooper with and without glasses

Height: 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet

Weight: 170 to 180 pounds

Build: Average to well built

Complexion: Olive, Latin ap-

ALPA PRESSES FOR ACTION ON

MID-AIR COLLISIONS

Pointing to a "needless slaughter'

esulting from 70 mid-air collisions oi

U. S. airliners in the past 25 years,.

ALPA urged congressional action to

make collision-avoidance equipment a

mondatory requirement for all aircraft

operating in government-controlled

airspace.

In testimony before the Senate

Subcommittee on Aviation on Dec. 1,

the Association emphasized the in-

creasing hazards of mid-air accidents.

A study made by the Depariment of

Transportation, ALPA said, projected

that by 1980 there would be approx-

imately 10 mid-air collisions occur-

ring each year. In 1971, there were

four such tragedies.

ALPA recommended two govem-

ment actions that should be taken im-

mediately to reduce or eliminote the

mid-air collision hazard:

"The first of these requires on im-

mediote decision on the part of the U,

S. government that the use of an ade-

quate collision avoidance system or

proximity warning indicator should be

made mandatory for every aircroît

operated within controlled airspace.

"The other action requires that

from airline and other high performance

civil aircraft."

In addition to these recommenda-

tions, ALPA asked for a live evalua-

tion of the several collision avoidance

systems now available. Recognizing

that installation of these systems would

entail particular burdens for light

plane owner, ALPA called for devel-

opment of a plan to help them finance

this hardware.

Although ALPA does not endorse

any particular equipment now being

offered as solutions to the collision

problem, it supported the Senate bill

under consideration (S. 2264), which

would facilitate the installation of

collision avoidance devices.

establishment of definite compliance

dotes, " ALPA said, "will also empha-

size the urgency of the problem and

take it out of the 'study' category."

FAA Continuing

Taxiway - Exit

Identification Lighting

Test At JFK And

Newark

The September 1971 PILOT BUL-

LETIN announced the beginning of

testing of taxiway exit lighting on

Newark runway 4L-22R. Now the

test is ready to be implemented at JFK

runway 3IR-13L. The runway ends

show red threshold lights at the for

ends. Green flush centerline lights

at runway and taxiway intersections

are the main features of the test,

along with green curved lead-out

lights at the center faxiway exit.

The airlines have probably al-

ready issued information and proce-

dures to pilots operating into these

airports. FAA will provide additional

information, ALPA requests that pi-

lots cooperate in this evaluation.

Please send a copy of your conclusions

ty Department for information purposes.

For the second time in less than

a week a CAB hearing examiner sup-

ported & position long urged by ALPA

and recommended sweeping changes

in the labor protective conditions tra-

ditionally imposed in merger cases.

(PILOT BULLETIN, November, page

l). In his récommended decision

approving the Allegheny-Mohawk

merger, Examiner Merritt Rublen re-

jected the position of the carriers that

the so-called "standard" provisions

first imposed in the United-Capital

merger case over a decade ago should

be imposed again without change.

Addressing himself directly to the

changes in the provisions recommended

by ALPA, Ruhlen wrote: "It is nee-

essary to consider the suggested

changes on their merits rather than to

rely on a decision of 10 years ago

made in a different economic climate

upon a different factual basis."

Ruhlen's recommended decision

endorsed the following changes in the

standard provisions urged by ALPA:

ALLEY

ENY - MOHAWK LABOR

PROVISIONS RECOMMENDED

(1) A shifting of the burden of

proof under the United-Capital for-

mula so that a claiming employe would

be required to do nothing more than

show that a merger occurred and that

his condition of employment changed

adversely. Should the employer con-

tend that the change was the result of

some factor other than the merger, the

burden would be on the employer to

establish that contention through the

production of evidence. (Under the

United-Capital formula, an employe

must carry the virtually impossible

burden of showing that his change in

employment was caused "solely" by

the merger and no other cause.)

(2) A change in the compensation

for a disploced employe to include

average compensation during the base

period plus "subsequent wage increases"

for the duration of the protection per-

iod. (United-Capital excluded all

ployes whose job status may be changed

by a corrier's rearranging of its work

force in anticipation of a merger

regardless of the date on which such

a rearrongement actually takes place.

Examiner Ruhlen's decision is now

subject to review and amendment by

the full CAB as well as final approval

by President Nixon before it may take

effect. ALPA attorneys have filed

briefs in both the Delta-Northeast

and Allegheny-Mohawk merger cases

urging that the specific differences of

the alteration in labor protective pro-

visions recommended by the two hear-

ing examiners be rationalized in such

a manner as to preserve the most sub-

JANUARY 1972

WARNING - NO IMMUNITY!

Pilots are warned that, effective

Dec. 31, 1971, they are no longer

provided with immunity when Near

Mid-air Collision Reports (FAA Form

8020-1) are filed.

President John J. O'Donnell

attempted to persuade FAA to retain

the immunity provision, but so far,

without success. The ATC Committee

will again seek to convince FAA that

the near mid-air reporting program is

useless without some protection being

given to the pilot and controller, alike.

As additional information becomes

available, it will be reported in ALPA

publications.

Noted that the use of "Air Line

ALPA Blasts Adminioration Proposals

To Increase Government Intervention

In Labor Disputes

Nixon administration proposals to

limit the right of airline employes to

take walkout actions in deadlocked

labor disputes "would constitute no-

thing less than a revolution in Ameri-

can labor relations," ALPA charged

at a hearing before the Senate Sub-

committee on Labor.

Under proposed revisions to the

Railway Labor Act, the President

would have authority to broaden the

scope of government intervention in

labor negotiations, thus averting pos-

sible walkouts that could tie up sir

In a statement by the Association,

it was pointed out that since 1933 there

have been over 500 collective bar-

gaining agreements reached with air-

line pilot groups represented by ALPA.

Throughout this 38-year period, there

have been only 14 pilot strikes and

only five of these lasted over 30 days.

The public interest, ALPA added,

is more seriously jeopardized by the

airlines' Mutual Aid Pact--a "strike

insurance" program under which funds

from subscribing corriers are given to

a struck airline. ALPA charged that a

recent trend to strikes of longer dura-

tion is the direct result of the avail-

ability of Mutual Aid funds.

carriers have only themselves to blame, "

A key provision in the proposal

would offer one of three new options

to the President os a "final solution"

to labor disputes. Each involves in-

creasing levels of government interven-

tion following an 80-day "cooling off

period now required when parties can-

not reach agreement on contracts.

The most severe measure would be

mandatory reopening of bargaining on

"final offers" submitted by both sides.

1f agreement still cannot be reached,

the President would name a three-man

board, called "selectors," who would

choose one of the offers, without mod-

ification, as the final settlement.

Disputing the proposal, ALPA

"In a free society, employes

and employers retain the power to settle

their own economic disputes...rather

then transfer this power to third-party

'experts.' Instead, solutions to labor

disputes must be discovered by and

acceptable to the parties who must

live with them. Anything else is too

remote and illusory to last."

ALPA stressed that federal labor

legislation has "traditionally been

aimed at establishing the mechanics

and procedures of collective bargain-

ing--not at determining the substance

of the bargains themselves.

ment's responsibility to bargain should

not be assumed by Congress."

The Association said it saw merit

in a feature of the administration pro-

posal that would establish a commission

to make a two-year study of labor re-

lations in industries "particularly vul-

nerable to national emergency disputes."

It was suggested that the study in-

clude such topics as: The value of per-

manent "neutrals, " causes of delay in

grievance handling, the effectiveness

of "tripartite" arbitration, statistics

on prearbitration settlements and need-

ed reforms in present grievance-arbitra-

tion procedures.

We're Making Progress

The federal sky marshal program

was in the news on several fronts this

month as it became known that funds

for the effort will probobly be cut by

about one-third in the next federal

budget. A United Press International

story noted that since the program

started in September 1970, the govern-

ment has trained 1,500 marshals "but

they have yet to thwart an inflight

hijacking."

CBS News asked the question

"The sky marshal program; has it beer

successful?" on the CBS Evening News

with Walter Cronkite on Jan, 4. Among

participants in the report, which pre-

sented viewpoints of various segments

of the airline industry, were ALPA

Executive Administrator Jack Bavis

and Caplain Cliff Wolff (UAL). High-

lights of the TV report included the

lack of security at airport terminals

and the need for international agree-

ments to cover the return and prosecu-

tion of hijackers.

In both the UPI story and the TV

report, ALPA stressed that the majority

of sky marshals could serve more effec-

tively at airport gates rather that aboard

aircraft.

CAB EXAMINER ACNST AAL-WAL MERGER SLAN: 000 4904

CAB Hearing Examiner William

Madden recommended on Dec. 20 that

the proposed merger behveen Western

and American be denied. If approved,

he said, the merged patter of service

would "seriously disrupt" the nation's

air transportation system, particularly

on West Coast and Pacific routes. Fur-

ther, he predicted that the creation of

a supercarrier would totally "upset the

balance" between larger and smaller

trunkline service.

In his 80-page decision, Madden

stressed that the merger of a big four

airline and another trunk carrier is not

in the public interest.

He also noted the availability of

stressed that the merger, if approyed,

would lead to the creation of multi-

billion-dollar "supercarrier," diverting

revenues from other airlines and weak-

ening their market position.

"Inevitably," ALPA said, "this

would lead to a series of defensive

mergers, thus further deteriorating le-

vels of competition and service. "

The Association's Executive Board,

recently took action "cohesively op-

posing" the American-Western merger.

ALPA OPPOSES DOP ACTION IN AAL-WAL MARGER CASE

Voicing strong opposition to ac-

tion token by the Department of Trans-

portation in the Americon-Western

merger case, ALPA President John J.

O'Donnell issued the following state-

ment this month:

"The Air Line Pilots Association

is very much alormed about the inter-

jection of the Department of Transpor-

tation into the issue of the American

Airlines-Western Air Lines proposed

merger. Mr. J. Thomas Tidd, speak-

ing for DOT, has sharply opposed the

opinion of CAB Examiner William

Madden that the merger should be dis-

approved. Mr. Madden's opinion that

the merger should not be consummated

has been concurred in by the Justice

Department.

"This development is an excelient

example of blatant interference in a

matter in which an appointed official --

the secretary of transportation--has no

personal expertise and proves, beyond

any doubt, that he is biased against

air transportation. The proposed mer-

ger is not within his domain. CAB was

deliberately estoblished by a wise Con-

gress to regulate the industry indepen-

dently of the Department of Transporta-

tion and enable it to remain aloof from

political measures.

"As president of the Air Line Pilots

Association, I wish to state that the

Issociation is fimly opposed to thi

nerger because it would seriously dis.

pt the delicate balance in the natior

l'air transportation system, have

severe impact on the employes involved

and would not be in the best interests

"The CAB examiner should be up-

held in this matter. The secretory of

transportation should not throw the

weight of his oflice around and attempt

to intimidate the board members who

must now rule on the question."

On November 27, 1971

a man who is

familiar with parachute clubs and jumpers in the southwesterr

part of washington and northern part of Oregon, advised that

a person jumping from a plane at about 7000 feet who had

to 25 seconds which would then place him at 3000 feet anc

for this reason no altimeter would be needed. He pointec

out that if the subject could have seen the ground there would

be no problem in landing if he had experience as a jumper.

He further pointed out that his experience as a jumper

shows him that the subject would not have needed jump boots,

other non-jumping equipment when weather conditions are

right. He also pointed out that the subject could land

within one nile of a pin point spot picked if he ha

experience and knew when to jump. hurther, he stated the

subject would have travelled 1/2 to 3/4 of

a mile from the

drop line from the plane in a 30 mile per hour wind if he

opened his chute at 3000 feet.

also advised that

he could also state that if the

subject had experience

he would know

the money would be

between his legs and this would not

cause any problems on landing or during descent.

suggested one person whom he thought could be capable of

the hijacking and that would be

who is a

good and experienced parachutist and pilot.

Jadvised that the parachute clubs in the

area he is

familiar with are the Pacific Parachute Club

which uses Donald airfield 30 miles south of Portland,

Oregon, and the Western Sport Parachute Center which uses

both the Frink field and the Hockinson field near Vancouver,

Washington; he pointed out that Puckett airfield is no

longer used as a jump center.

B7C

Upon hearing the newscasts and reading the papers

concerning the skyjacking of a commercial aircraft in Seattle,

Washington, on November 24, 1971, and upon seeing an artists

conception of the individual who perpetrated this crime.

Jadvised he believes he talked to a man who closely

resembles the subject during July or August 1971. Based upon

his conversation with this individual he strongly suspects

the man may be the person connected with this crime.

recalled that he talked to this man for

approximately ten

to fifteen minutes concerning different

aspects of parachute jumping and during this conversation

one go about jumping out of jets.

I specifically

recalls telling the man it could be done if the door of the

aircraft opened inward or if it had a rear stairwell that

could be raised and lowered.

The man appeared interested

and they discussed this further, to the point where air

speed and drag was talked about.

Ine fact was brought up

that full flaps and lowered landing gear would supply the

drag needed to exit from a jet.

The man also asked

_where jump centers were

located in the northwest.

told him about three

locations in the State of washington, 'one by the Boeing

Air Field in seattle, one on the lashingion side of the

Columbia Raver, just north of Portland, oregon, and the other

center inbetween.

The man was apparently interested, but did

not right down the names or locations of those centers mentioned

stated it was his opinion that a person

contemplating a skyjacking of a commercial aircraft would

ask

questions such as those purposed. He recalled at the time

these questions were asked he thought it was strange as nobody

else has ever purposed such questions to him.

nished the following information:

Concerning the individual he talked to sometime during

July or August 1971, who

I belleves could be identical to

the subject that hijacked the Northwest, Airlines aircraft on

November 24, 1971, he recalled that the man he talked to must

have been a smoker of Raleigh Cigarettes because he observed

Raleigh coupons in the man's possession and remarked to him that

he smoked

those

cigarettes with the coupons and could save enough

to buy a

"P. C.

, meaning Para-Commander type parachute, the

kind used by parachute enthusiasts and most sport jumpers.

advised he recalled this while studying the

Government memorandun containing the description of the man who

hijacked the aircraft on November 24, 1971.

He further advised

that he doubted that the man he talked to belonged to any para-

chute or jumping clubs inasmuch as.the average age of jumpers

is between 25 to 28 years and they would not hang around with an

"old guy like that"

', and too because most clubs in California

have disbanded in the last year and a half.

Concerning clubs and their locations,

advised

that they could be identified through the U. s.

Parachute Asso-

ciation which prints a brochure with the clubs in alphabetical

order by states.

california, furnished the following

information:

Concerning an individual who talked to him

at Skylark Field at Elsinor, California who resembles

the artist's concoption of the hijacker of the horchwest

aircrait in seattle on november tys 19ft,

Istated

he has reviewed his thoughis and is certain ne can

narrow the time span to the niddlo or late part of

August 1971 when this conversation occurred. He still

...

believes it was strange that a person would ask questions

about jumping out of jet aircraft and discuss air speed

then have something like the hijacking that occurred

happen a short tine later.

He also stated that it may

be coincedental but he saw an advertisement on pages

46 and 47 of Look magazine dated sugust 24; 1971 showing

a parachutist jumping out of a jet.aircraft. He stated

this may have stimulated questions by soneone secing this

advertisement, however, he is still concerned since the

individual he

spoke to resembles the artist's conception

of the hijacker.

He does not know the name of the man

he talked

to and has not seen him since.

He did state

he believes he would recognize the man if he sees him

again.

ReBuairtel to AL, 12/7/71.

On 12/20/71, FLOYD WASHBURN, Manager, U.S,

Parachute Service, 6976 E. Baseline, Mesa, Arizona, was

contacted regarding captioned matter.

WASHBURN stated he was

familiar with this matter and believed the subject would have

had to have been a sporting parachutist and parachute rigger

in order to accomplish his feat.

WASHBURN indicated a listing of licensed parachutists

is maintained by the U.S. Parachute Association in Monterey,

California. The U.S. Parachute Association has supposedly

instituted a policy approximately two years ago wherein they

have on file photographs of all licensed paradutists.

Inquiries made to the U.S. Parachute Association should be

California.

Although it is noted approximately 40 percent of

the nation's parachutists are licensed, this could conceivably

be a worthwhile lead for office of origin in this matter.

Phoenix will attempt to conduct appropriate investi

gation to ascertain the location of the list for licensed

parachute riggers.

He referred to a teletype of 12/ /71 from

Portland in regard to a person who was

He said it seemed to him

that Portland had set out a lot of unnecessary

investigation since the purpose of the thing was simply

to get a photo of the suspect and have it shown to

witnesses rather than getting all the background.

He wanted to know if we had considered

having a Northwest plane fly Agents over the exact course at

night so that we could look down and see just what the

situation was when the "bump" occurred at 8:10 or 8:12 PM.

I told him we had considered this and also had considere

hiring someone to parachute

from the plane but the problem

was that there was no way of duplicating the conditions

which existed at the time.

He requested we put some type

of language in a teletype about

Re:

FLYING SCHOOLS, AIRPORTS

AND SKY DIVING CLUBS

On the possibility that subject might have

rented a plane and flown over the area of southwest Washington

or that he might have chartered a plane for the same purpose,

the following investigation should be instituted:

1. Identify and then contact each flying school

for anyone who might fit the subject's description as

having rented a plane.. etc.

2. Identify and then contact all air fields

which might have rented such an aircraft to anyone who

could answer the subject's description in this case.

3. Identify and contact each sky diving school

or club and attempt to determine if the UNSUB might be

known to them.

The above investigation should be done on an

RA basis with King County being handled by Seattle.

The SRA will coordinate the project for each

particular RA.

Last November24th,

a man identifying himself as

¿ Cooper!

parachuted from a Northwest Orient

ines. 727 jetliner between Seattle and Reno Nevada

with a parcel containing 10,000 twenty dollar bills which

was the ransom money that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattle-

Tacoma International airport.

The F.B.I. and other state and local law enforcement

arents assisted by companies of G.L's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payer's dollars looking for cooper.

So far Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same ingenious manner

that he pulled off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

danger.

The F.B.L headquaters in Seattle has vowed to ser

utinize every foot of land between the Sea-Tac airport •

and Reno to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias '

Fink on your Friends" programe the public has generally

granted Cooper adoratica and somewhat a hero status.

anonymous interviewer from the twice weekly

spaper the 'Seattle Flag' has produced a story from

a taped interview with D.B. Cooper which is validated

by the, presentation of one of the recorded twenty dollar

bills included in the ransom money.

This story was run in the 'Flag' because the inter-

viewer was unable to send it to the 'Post-Intellingener'

because they had the 5,000 dollar reward out for Coopers

head also television stalions would have requested a fape

from which voice prints could possible be produced.

Therefore; running the story in the Flag was the only

solution.

Cooper said that the witnesses description were off

by about fifteen pounds and a couple of inches. Aiso that

the artist's impression were very poor. When asked why

it was a calculated risk that's why he jumped in bad

weather and at night, also he waited a little longer than

usual before pulling his ripcord.

Adding that his free

fall was about 5,000 ol the total 7,000 feet, Which was very

risky doing at night.

He came down about a hundred miles away from S.W..

Washington contrary to the F.B.I, report that he touched

down near Vancouver Washington.

The first thing he did on landing was bury his chute,:

he was within five miles of where he had intended in an

evergreen wooded terrain, He credited this.accuracy

to his projected calculations and his japanese watch.

He wouldn't say whether he had an accomplice on the.

back with the money in a canvas bag to where coper

was holding another stewardess as hostage in the rear

of the passenger cabin.

Cooper checked out the loot, first thing and noticed

that they reeked of duplicating fud. Then the stewardess

made two more trips out on to the run way to bring in

the centese of the fuel trucks pulled up. then he ordi

eged the passengers off the plane, and everyone else into

started to push his way back through the line into the

The area believed to be the drop zone of the subject in

as that area in the State of Washington

bounded on the rorth by the Lewis River, the east by the

Jadvised the only likely river feeding the Columbia

capable of moving several bundles of money or a package

about 16x16x4 inches to the Columbia River would be the

Washougal River.

A logical time, if the money came down the

flood when parts of the river were approximately

ten feet over the normal winter flood stage.

There are several other streams that feed the

The purpose of obtaining this information

was to determine if it was possible that the bait money

Vancouver, Washington, on February 10, 1980, could have been

placed there through

was during August 6 through September 18, 1974..

Material dredged from the river channel in the

Columbia River was placed in several locations on or near

The dredge material deposited at the site where

the money was located came from the north half of the ship

channel, which is 300 feet wide, between river mile 96

plus 38 feet and river mile 97 plus 17 feet. This material

was deposited on the beach area of the

The channel is maintained at 40 feet in depth

and all the material above 40 feet is dredged out.

The

dredge "Washington" of the General Construction Company

did the dredging on this project.

It had a 24 inch pipe

advised that he found the beach area

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer, and below that an older sand layer. The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money. This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were not severely damaged or rusted. The

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dredge) sand was a mix-

ture of course sand

and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size.

Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the columbia

River at this

site in 1974, _

I stated this clay layer

in all probability, was deposited during that 1974 dredging.

The

older sands, which

were light in color and uniform in texture

and which were found below the clay lump sand, were deposited

prior to the 1974 dredging.

advised that in the post dredging

layer, he

found cross bedded course and medium sand, which in

dicated the river and river waves had worked repeatedly on this

layer since 1974.

The upper six inches to eight inches of re-

worked beach sand is the active layer which is currently being

worked by the water of the Columbia River.

Based on the condition of the money through observation,

Jadvised that the money was probably washed into

the location where it was found by natural river flow and was

probably placed at the location of Tena Bar during the last

rise in the Columbia River in the past two or three months.

FBi calls off search

for more hijack money

The FBI has, at least temporarily,

called off its search along the Columbia

River for more of the money obtained

eight years ago by the airplane hijacker

who used the name Dan Cooper.

Jack Pringle, assistant special agent

in charge of the FBI's Seattle office,

said, the search

was called off late

Thursday night after several days of

sand-sifting produced no new evidence.

The Seattle office has coordinated

search efforts in the Cooper caper, the

only

unresolved hijacking on record

since it occurred in 1971.•

Pringle said search efforts might be

renewed next week, after the results of

laboratory tests are received on the sev-

eral thousand dollars in badly decayed

ing family Sunday about nine miles

downstream from Vancouver.

He said there was a chance the tests

gets frayed $20 bill !

VANCOUVER, Wash, ÷ Eight-

year-old Brian Ingram, who found bun-

dies of $20 bills last week but had to

turn them over to authorities, has been

given one by the FBI.

The boy jumped into the national

spotlight Feb. 10 when he discovered

several thousand dollars of the $200,000

ransom paid to skyjacker Dan Cooper in

1971. The money, frayed around the

eages,

was identified by FBI agents

who have been looking for Cooper since :

he jumped from a Northwest Orient

Airlines plane over Southwest Wash-

ington.

The $20 was given to the boy by

Mike Heywood, Hough Elementary

School PTA president. Accompanying

the bill was a certificate praising the

boy for his find.

Since finding the money, Brian and

his parents, H. Dwayne and Patricia,

have been the subject of network televi-:

Earlier, Ralph Himmelsbach, a Portland FBI agent who has had

charge of following new leads in the Cooper case for a number of

years, said he believed the money must have been deposited within

a couple of years after the skyjacking.

He says discovery of the money provided a major break in the

They also wonder whether they should have paid

more attention to the sand dredging operations along

Vancouver. The lonely country road that winds along

the beach, Lower River Road, dead-ends about three

miles from where a Vancouver family found about

Rabbits bounce on the side of the road at night, startl-

farms. The Fazio Bros. Sand Co. also fronts the river.

A road leading through the Fazio gate is a popular

path to the beach. It is the same path used by the

family the day they found the money. On the east side

of Fazio Bros. is Leeward Isle Marina, with a public

fishing boat launch and one or two house boats.

During fishing season, the beach is packed from

Ellis. They have lived in their mobile home just down

Every day Clarence takes his outboard skiff along

renegade logs that could damage other boats.

Ellis says that the Army Corps of Engineers con-

linuously dredges sand directly off the shore from

where the money was found.

His wife, Barbara, said she felt "kinda sick" not

finding it. But she added that she would have turned it

The beach property actually belongs to the Hans:

How it

started

On Nov. 24, 1971, a calm,

middle-age

man

calling

himself Dan Cooper bought a

ticket for a Northwest Airlines

flight to Seattle.

Shortly after takeoff,

he

handed a note to stewardess

Florence Schaffner.

Thinking the man was try-

ing to "hustle" her, she stuff-

ed the note in her purse, but he

motioned for her to read it.

The

note said

he had

a

bomb, and

wanted to go to

Mexico.

While the jet circled Seattle

before landing, the skyjacker

also ordered that $200,000 cash

and

four

parachutes be

brought to the plane.

The

airline

agreed,

36

passengers and part of the

crew were allowed to leave,

and the plane took off with the

,man and his ransom.

As it flew south, the rear

airstair was lowered,

and

minutes

later

the plane

treacted in a manner that con-

vinced the crew that the sky-

jacker had

bailed

out

somewhere

in

the

Lewis

River-Lake Merwin area

east

of Woodland.

Thus began the legend

of

D.B. Cooper (the name Dan

Cooper somehow got lost in

news media accounts of the in-

cident.)

Cooper

has never

been

found, but interest in the case

is still strong, and flared Tues-

day when the FBI announced

a Vancouver family had found

inseveral thousand dollars of the

ransom money on a Columbia

River beach northwest of Van-

couver.

Several stories

about the

case appear in today's issue of

The Daily News.

FBI: Cooper likely

dead man

By KERRY WEBSTER

LiNT Staff Writer

It's more likely than ever that

the legendary D. B. Cooper is just a

grinning skeleton in a nyion shroud,

say FBI agents raking the sand for

the last of his mouldering stash.

"The discovery of the money

adds credence to the theory that he

probably did not survive the jump,"

said Bill Williams, a special agent

in Portland.

On the north bank of the Column-

Dia River today, more than 30 FBI

agents worked behind a cordon of

armed sheritf's deputies, spading

over every square foot

along 150 feet of shoreline.

The site is where eight-year-old

Brian Ingram of Vancouver, digg-

ing idly in the sand with a stick on

Sunday, turned up a sodden wad of

$20 bilis.

Serial numbers on the money -

12 stacks of twerities, still in their

bank wrappings - matched some

of those given to "Dan Cooper"

when he hijacked Northwest Air-

lines Flight 305 on 'Thanksgiving

Eve, 1971.

Flourishing what looked like a

stick of dynamite,

"Cooper"

or-

dered the plane to fly from Seattle-

Tacoma International Airport to

Reno, Nev., after first demaninding

$200,000 and four parachutes.

The Boeing 727's flight recorder

indicated that he jumped from the

plane's lowered

rear stairwell

somewhere near Ariel, a tiny logg-

i ing town in Southwest Washington.

No trace of Cooper or the hijack-

ing loot had shown up in the past

-nine years. The mysterious air pi-

rate in that time has become a cult

figure, with sweatshirts, bumper-

stickers and endless pulp-magazine

stories dedicated to the exploit.

Himmelsbach said the find re-

§that Cooper is still alive.

The money was found Sunday by

an 8-year-old Vancouver boy, Brian

Ingram, and his 5-year-old cousin,

Denise, as they were digging in the

sand with sticks along the river bank

during a family outing.

"This clue is the first we've bad

in charge of the Portland office,

which the Ingram family contacted on

Monday.

The bijacker, who had used the

name "Dan Cooper" to buy his airline

ticket, boarded the jet in Portland,

threatened to blow it up with what he

claimed was a bomb in his brieicase,

Athen forced it to land in Seattle to col-

Cooper allowed 36 passengers

aboard the flight to leave, then or-

dered the crew of four to fly it to

Reno after $200.000 in marked bills

and four parachutes demanded by the

hijacker were brought on board.

As the southbound airliner passed

over Southwest Washington, the hi-

jacker - wearing only a business suit

and street shoes - parachuted

through a rear stairwel door.

As "Dan Cooper" became a legend,

the name "D.B. Cooper" — as an FBI

agent had initially identified him -

became the name that stuck.

Dear

This letter is in regards to the parachuting skyjacking on

November 24, 1971 of a Northwest Airlines plane between Seattle,

Washington and Reno, Nevada. This case has, so far, not been

solved and the skyjacker who collected $200,000 is known only as

D.B. Cooper.

In a telephone conversation on November 8, 1973 with l

at Northwest Airlines,

rewards offered in this case.

He told me of rewards having been

offered of 10% of recovered amounts, or possibly $25,000 if all

is recovered.

offering $5000.

RE:

On June 1, 1973, BILL CLAUSNER, Sheriff of

Stevenson, Washington, advised that $480 worth of $20

bills, 1950 series, were found in a home in North Bonney-

washington.

CLAUSNER advised an elderly lady was

living in the home and moved to Goldendale, Washington,

to be nearer her family.

The elderly lady is named Mrs.

MIDLAND, according to CLAUSNER.

Subseguent to her move, an envelope was dis-

covered in the vacant home containing the $20 bills.

CLAUSNER advised all of the $20 bill serial numbers vere

Iun through NCIC, as well as compared with serial numbers

on the D. B. COOPER

ranson list.

There was no match

either in NCIC or with the D. B. COOPER ransom list.

It is noted all the D. B. COOPER ransom serial

numbers have

been entered into NCIC.

No further investigation appears to be warranted

concerning this matter.

in the "Seattle Flag" the microfilm of the ranson money

was sent to the FBI Lab via pilot courier on Northwest

1972 and was to be picked up on arrival at Dulles Airpor

at 5 p.n. by the Alexandria Office (See 161-81-3181 - daily

summary).

The original communication to Alexandria is Seattle

teletype dated May 4, 1972, serial 164-81-3076.

In view of the fact that the case against L

will be going to

trial, the Bureau is not being requested at this time to

on 4/26/72 I called SA

at the Bureau.

I told him we had some representatives of the Secret

Service 1opt st the kerox coples of the bills purported to be

possession.

I advised him that according to the Secret Service

representatives there is always a capitalized letter and a

Re.

small number on the

upper left-hand corner of each bill.

The same capitalized letter with the same or a different

number appears

in the lower right-hand corner of the bill.

On Bill No. I the number and letter in the upper left

corner, according to the Xerox, is C 4. The microfilm of

this same bill, however, shows

the letter in the lower right

corner of that

same bill to be H, the letter being obscured.

According

to the Secret Service, both of these letters

should be the same and clearly they are not.

With Bill No. 2, according to the Xerox the letter

in the upper left corner is E 2, whereas the microfilm

is rather unclear but there appears to be an f in the lower

right corner.

He advised that the Bureau of engraving has looked

at the bills and think that one of the digits in the serial

number of bill No. 1 is off.

I told him we were endeavoring to locate the third

bill and would let him know when done.

In the meantime we

were trying to get a clear. look at Bill No. 2.

He first wanted to know if there is a reward

for the hijack money.

He said he can take us to it.and

even to the room next to where it is maintained.. He

said he is concerned about prosecution himself as an

accessory or having knowledge. He has a bad record. He

was in jail when the hijacking took place. He said about

95% of the money is available but he could not tell me

now much money in dollars is involved which might indicate

he does not know how much was paid in ranson. He wants

guarantee of non-prosecution and no publicity. He said

the money is not in Spokane and not in this state. He

said he is interested in "hard cash" and wants to know

how much he can get.

The caller sounded coherent and clear and intelli-

gent. He was advised that no figure of reward could be

told to him now but that if he assisted in this matter

he would be reasonably and profitably compensated.

Later this afternoon, the writer was informed

MEMO TO EARL MILNES

Dear Earl:

After I called you this morning, I told

I1 would call back in the

afternoon but I was

_and didn't get back as early as I had figured.

With current events as they are, I know that you have your hands full

and I don't intend to take but just a moment of your time.

were discussing the extensive list which had to be printed

and sent out with regard to the currency which was turned over to the

hijacker and the cost (to the taxpayers) which was run up in getting the

booklet printed and mailed all over the country. This may or may not

be a matter of particular interest to you,

came up with an idea

which might help recover some of those printing costs and, with any

luck, might even turn up some of the items which are listed.

That is for the FBI to get a news release out to every daily newspaper

(thru AP or UP| wire) that copies of the list of bills, in booklet form,

are available to anyone interested at a cost of $1.00 apiece. Not that

she nor I subscribe to the "hero-worship" concept we've been reading

about, but we believe there'd be hundreds who would like to get ahold

of a copy... either for curiosity's sake or as a souvenir item. In addition

to making the books available for a buck apiece, the news item could

also point out that if an actual bill was turned up, j. Edgar Hoover

would buy it back for $21.00, thereby returning their investment on

the book.

I know it may sound weird but, on the other hand, I can see how it

also might even turn up some real good leads.

I suggested that

as an economic matter it might be more desirable to have the

be distributed to newspapers and used by them as a means

more to print the list.

I talked to SA BLAND about this matter and he

advised that it would have to be initiated by the investiga-

they were exploring the possible costs of this matter and

would let us know Monday.

In the meantime I had talked to

He called back and said they were not going to do

this because first, they did not think most newspapers would

publish it; second, they did not want all SAC's to have the

feeling that they had to get it published, which might cause

a great deal of difficulty around the field. He said he

thought their instructions were sufficient, that if we could

arrange to get it published in our division, and if we wanted

to call other offices on a selected basis, and see if the

SAC's could work out some arrangement to publish it, he would

a man who is

that

a person Jumping fron a plane at about 1000 feet who had

experience could free fall and while doing so could count

to 25 seconds which would then place him at 3000 feet and

for this reason no altimeter would be needed.

out that if the subject could have seen the ground there would

be no problen in landing if he had experience as a jumper.

He further pointed out

that his experience as a jumper

shows him that the subjcat would not have needed jump boots,

a helnet, jump suit, or any other special equipment for

he and other chutists

jump in shorts, tennis shoes, and

other non-jumping equipnent when weather conditions are

right. He also pointed out that the subject could land

within one mile of a pin point spot picked if he hac

experience and knew when to jump.

Further, he stated the

subject would have travelled 1/2 to 3/4 of

a mile from the

drop line from the plane in a 30 mile pen hour wind if he

opened his chute at

3000 feet.

also advised that

he could also state that if the subject had experience

he would know that the easiest place to put a container with

the money would be batween his legs and this would not

cause any problens on landing or during descent.

suggested one person whom he thought could be capable of

the hijacking and that would bel

who is a

Jadvised that the parachute clubs in the

arca he is faniliar with are the Pacific Parachute Club

which uses Donald airfield 30 miles south of Portland,

Oregon, and the Western Sport Parachute Center which uses

both the Frink field and the Hockinson field near Vancouver,

that there might be some possibinity that a

used in conjunction with a low frequency transmitter on the

ground - to know when to drop. He said this would put one within

a 3 mile radius from a 10,000 foot level jump on target.

However, he noted too, that any transisterized receiver in use

should be reflected in the
