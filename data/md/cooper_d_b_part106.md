FROM:L

Supervisory Fingerprint Specialist

Laboratory Division

RE: NORJACK

Per my informal memo to you dated 5/19/98 and our telephone conversation on 5/22/98, this is

to inform you that the elimination prints we discussed have not been received in the Latent

Fingerprint Section (LFS). Therefore, the target date of 6/19/98 for comparing the unidentified

latent prints on the memo and resume with the elimination prints was not met.

A review of the 24 fingerprints developed on three paper items submitted with Seattle

communication dated 11/29/71 has resulted in the determination that two of the fingerprints are

suitable for automated searches. These searches have been initiated. In order to accomplish a

thorough search of these two prints with the prints of persons arrested in the continental United

States, Canada and Mexico, it is necessary to submit approximately fitty requests that limit each

search to certain geographical areas. This is very time consuming. Once that process is

completed, the prints of suspects generated as a result of those searches have to be retrieved from

the Criminal Justice Information Services Division in Clarksburg, West Virginia, for comparison

purposes. Obviously, this will take more time than originally thought.

Although the LPS is very willing to assist the Seattle Division in any way possible to bring this

matter to closure, the Seattle transmittal communication dated 11/29/71 indicates the papers were

pushed down behind a seat and were found by a Northwest Airlines mechanic. The

communication further states, "There is no apparent connection between these papers and the

hijacker, however, so they may be properly examined the Bureau is requested to process these

papers for any latent fingerprints and return them for future use if needed."

Attached is a list of " UNIDENTIFIED LATENT FINGERPRINTS IN NORJACK CASE."

Because of the above quotation and the tremendous amount of time and resources that it takes to

conduct the automated searches, the Seattle Division is requested to review the list and use the

utmost discretion in determining the feasibility of conducting additional automated searches. If

it is determined that automated searches of latent fingerprints pn certain items are feasible, the

LFS will evaluate those prints to determine if they meet the criteria for search and initiate

appropriate searches.

You may contact Fingerprint Specialis L

or me with any questions.

Duane Weber and first wife (1971); FBI Cooper sketch (below)

Who was D. B. Cooper?

he identity of legendary skyjacker D. B. Cooper

has baffled investigators for decades. But the

FBI may finally have enough evidence to solve

the mystery that dates back to November 1971, when

a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 305 from

Portland, Ore., to Seattle handed a flight attendant a

note. The man claimed to have a bomb in his bag

and threatened to detonate it unless he received

$200,000 in cash and four parachutes. The FBI

turned over the money and parachutes in Seattle,

and the plane took off again-this time for Mexico.

At 10,000 feet, the hijacker

walked down the rear stairs and

parachuted into history.

He used the name "Dan Cooper"

but later was mistakenly identified

by a reporter as D. B. Cooper, and

the name stuck. The FBI now sus-

pects he may have been an ex-con

named Duane Weber. On March

28, two agents fetched an electric

razor, a pair of slippers, gloves, and

other items from Weber's widow, Jo Weber, a Florida

real estate agent. Their hope: to get DNA to compare

with DNA left by the skyjacker on cigarette butts.

Duane and Jo Weber were married for 17 years. On

his deathbed, in 1995, Weber said he was Dan Coop-

er. Jo learned a year later that was the name the hi-

jacker had used. Site took out a library book on the in-

cident; her husband's penciled notes were inside. The

FBI described D. B. Cooper as being in his 40s, 6 feet

tall, 170 pounds, with black hair. He was a bourbon

drinker and a chain smoker. At the time of the hijack-

ing, Duane was 47, 6 feet, 1 iuch, and weighed around

185 pounds. He had black hair, drank bourbon, and

chain-smoked. He'd served time in McNeil Island

penitentiary, 20 miles from the Seattle airport.

The FBI won't discuss its probe. But Ralph Him-

melsbach, the original lead agent, says Weber re-

mains a principal suspect. "One way or another,"

says Jo Weber,

"I am looking for a final resolution to

this case." - Douglas Pasternak

TOP OF THE WEEK

women in areas of conflict

are at high risk of sexual vio-

lence and physical harm,

tratficking and prostitution,

emotional tratima, family

separation, and abuse in

refugee camps. Among the

riskiest nations: Congo,

Sierra Leone, Afghanistan,

Angola, and Burundi.

nearly enough to coordinate

efforts to prevent and re-

women and children."

HEALTH

Worried sick

Looks like the Democrats are

on to something. A new sur-

vey shows Americans' No. 1

personal concern is how

they'll pay for healthcare.

More than one third (36 per-

cent) of people polled by the

Kaiser Family Foundation

said they're worried about

health and insurance costs.

How worried? Nearly twice

as much as they are about

eral courthouse in Houston last week.

Congress should do about it?

cans. Sound familiar?

Northern exposure

Canadians breathed a sigh of

relief last week when the

World Health Organization

lifted its week-old advisory

against travel to Toronto,.

also lifted its Hanoi travel

ban, praising Vietnamese

health officials' success in

curbing the pneumonia-

not out of the woods. Late

last week, two more health-

care workers became infect-

ed, proving again just how

hard it is to halt infection in

hospitals. And each day,

China reported more infec-

tions and deaths.

seasonal ailment, like colds

and the flu. A summer hill

patrol divisions of both the oakland Police Department and the

Alameda County Sheriff's Office regarding LARRY QUANDT.

Washington.

It was stressed that no federal warrants exist

against QUANDT and that he is only wanted for questioning.

It

was also expressed to the above agencies that QUANDT is not aware

that the FBI is interested in interviewing him and that, if

stopped, he should not be advised of the FBI's interest in him;

the reason being that upon locating QUANDT, It will be necessary

for agents from Seattle and Newark, New Jersey to travel to

immediately contact SA|

of the Oakland

Resident Agency and both

seattle and Newark will be notified.
