hijacker was a novice in one respect.

went on to

explain that on certain chutes, there are releases called

"capewells." These are used when a person is going to jump

in a wooded area. "Capewells" enable the chutist, once he

has landed in the trees, to unbuckle the harness, thus

releasing his chute altogether.

"ithout these, a person

would either have to cut the chute away from himself

or step out of it, which is very difficult to do if he is

in a tree.

In another respect,

was under the

impression that this hijacker might have known what he was

doing and may have had some type of training in parachuting

"smoke jumper school" or possibly may have been a

member of some parachuting group,such as the Special Forces,

in the Armed Forces.

Examples of these are the "Green

Berets," the "Rangers" or the "101 Airbourn."

further advised that according to the

Dear Sir:

I presume your office is involved in the search for the recent

hijacker and the money involved.

I am enclosing two clippings from ny copy of the Sunday Nov. 28

Salem Statesman. I notice a possibility of a relationship betwen

the two events and am calling it to your attention at the risk of

wasting your valuable time.

As I see it, the hijacker mentioned wanting to go to Mexico,

and the ransom was

paid in Mexico City. The amount the hijacker

roceived was i200,000.00 and the ransom paid in lexico was the same.

It is reported as dollars ratber than so many pesos equal to approx-

inately so many dollars (or what ever the Mexican ronetary denonination

would be). The ransom was paid on Saturday abnut TWO days after the

hijacking. And last but not least, note the last paragraph with

regard to another kidnaping in Sopt. 1971 of the Federal AVIAFICN

Director who was exchanged for i 240,000.00 ransom.

Il you are interested in checking on this I will also tell you

Portland,, Oregon

Dear Friends:

I see! nobody has found out what happened to the airplane hi jacker

yet. I thot for sure that by Sunday someone would find the parachutes.

I have written several letters to you about 1t and I guess this one

will finally be the last. I hope I. have been some help in the case.

You will have to discount what I wrote about Springfield, Oregon tho

I guess.

I had the spirit pretty good Saturday nite and it told me

more about the case and repeated some of the things it had already

told me and you can bet yout bottom dollar that you were

pretty hot

in looking for him at Hoodland, but you have to go a Ilttle south

and cross the tolumbia.. The spirit told me so many times that he came

'down near a fair'_'came down over a fair' and even once said he was

in a

fair that I have pinpointed the Multnonah County fairgrounds or

near it as the place. The spirit also said 'he came down over a Mare'

This 1s symbolic- 1t means an island like the fair area seema to be

on because Mare Island in San Francisco 1s the symbolls- so Mare in

this case means

an island. It also said celery.

-to me this also means

island, because in Spokane in the twenties when I was there, there

were some chinese raising cetery in the delta part of a river there

not far from town- the southwestern section.. Celery would mean then-

delta area.

I have never been over around that section, but 1f I did

I would look around the

columbia river on the west side

and maybe near

the north end of Smith lake.

Smith lake looks like a horse with his

front feet down and a saddle on his back., there are two little horns

or saddle horns I call them sticking up on the northern side of the

seater, "aybe this is what the spirit meant when it said ' he 1s in a

There 1s a little inlet there on the north side of the lake.

If he made it accross the Columbla and got on the west side then he

probably let the chutes go in to the lake and they floated down the

river.

The spirit seemed to say today Sunday that he had left the

area. It.is pretty definite with me then that he floated over the

fair grounds.

Maybe even the race track and came down

in the

middle

of 1t.

There was a word cane thru me early last week ' union' and

I wondered what it meant and today in looking at the may I found a

street or avenue

called Union.

I think he was on it and either caught

a trolley or walked on 1t.

The spirit Saturday nite told me

three times that he was a

• drugger.

This means that he was narcotic.

It also said he was a collector.

I wonder what he collected besides

the $200,000 ?

Maybe he 1s selling narcotics, also, but there was

another

aspect of the case- it said he called al

and I thot 1t

- could mean his sweetheart, but at least two times or more it said he

called a lawyer.

Maybe he called a lawyer and the secretary answered.

Could he be maybe a wanted man and need

a lot of money to buy himself

off? Maybe the lawyer is in cahoots with him and owns a light plane

and picked him up.

He sure made a phone call according to the spirit.

When I was out walking bothe

twice- it said

"He had four Saturday and Sunday I got a message

and then broke off. The sentence was

not finished. I figured he had four men in with him. How did he

know when to jump off.

Did he go by lights or did he have something

in his brief case such ag

a powerful walkie talkly @police

rigged up with someone on the ground?

Maybe he was smarter than I thot he was and was

ngt

He could thus stand the cold in the plane bettér

I will have to discount my idea of him having anything to do ith the

ile is undoubtly in with a

Beng

If he is in narcotics then he probably also likes to gamble as

a high roller or play the horses and that is why he wanted to co to

Reno and said something asout lexico.

Maybe his buddies buy dope in

rexico and use a small plane to get it. I would check lighu plane

liscenses issued to layyers issued in Portlana, Seattle, and Tenatchee.

The reason I said Tenatchee is because something came thru me about

Tenatchee.

It also mentioned'Kentuckian' and the spirit called kin

Colonel and so I think he might be a Kentucky Jolonel.

If the money was

marked you will probably find some of it pretty soon unless he left the

country and went to Monte Jarlo.

That might be why the spirit said for

= cou-le of days " He is in a seater'

raybe he flew out of the country

with the loot.

I personally don't think you will find him, but you

one o just tina those chutes floating in the river of doin at istoria

these days, but I think he got anay now.

There was once the spirit seemed to say

he paints' This might nean

he used a dye to cover up his greay hair.

Saturday I was out walking and the spirit said ' there's a bar' then it

broke off and a little later a bar was bombed in Belfast. I he.rd it on

the radio.

On Friday it said Paris thru me three times and a little

later on the radio I heard of another hijackins in paris. I get these

words thru me every day.

I years ago I had the

noly ghost for three days and that was just a news flash with whole

sentences and paragraphs coming thru me .

It is a pulsation.

Hobody in

the United States could have it at the present time or I would know about

The only country I can think of that might be close is red china.

I actually believe many chinese people at present time contact the spirit.

This is called Karma. If I had the holy ghost at present time I could

solve all your crimes or most of them anyhow, but sorry I don't have it.

I am the only one in the world at the present time no can sit at a

typewriter and say exactly what a man must do to contact God and have the

holy ghost. It really is very simole if you know ho, but if you are

ruptured you can't get it and

It is all in the bible except the drinking of coffee. If you are a yourg

man shall we say between 20 and 35 then prepare to take a year out of your

Don't drink a cup of coffee in that ihole year. Don't use the sex.

Do not smoke or drink. Give up all the animal foods. This includes milk,

butter, cheese and etc.

Go by ihat it says in the book of Genesis.

Int all the fruit and herbs. A good bowl of vegetable soup every day will

do it and a little oil or peanut butter, rye bread and any kind of

raw fruit and when the blood turns over yu will start to contact God

and he will send his son the thrist and you will get burned out. That is

what haopened to me

Now is only

hear a few words. The burning out process takes about an hour and it

takes a year of good living and much walking to reacn it.

A man is either

in the blood or out of the blood.

If you eat a lot of blood producing

foods you will be in the blood and can't contact. If you eat fruits and

vegetables you give up your blood gradually and build towards a flesh

and bone body.

Ihis is mentioned in the scriptures.

The church people

all missed the boat.

Je wouldn't nive a Viet jam iar or so much crime

now if men were working for the holy Ghost in this country and a permanent

peace would be a reality.

The hard crust of the church system is

a hard nut to crack. They persist in following ceremony.

God don't give

a hang about ceremony. Health minded people is what he is looking for.

Men who walk and hike

or ride a bicycle and be careful to eat the

natural

fruits and vegatables and give up the sex and coffee and processed foods.

It does call for a little sacrifice and men just don't give it all up.

look about you and try to find a man who don

t smoke, don't drink liquor

or coffee, don't use sex and a walker. A vegetarian?

The word college made m

shink of that college of

esty after I had seen

it on the map and wondered if he had any connection with it. What do you

think?

Two or three things stand out then.

If he were smart he bailed out

quickly and knew just what he was doing and got home in no time, because

he probably lived around there.

't personally think he was smart

at all and probably had never been down in a parachute at all. I think

he is dead someplace, but it is sure funny that the chutes have not

showed up and neither has he. There are a lot of people out looking for

him.

What the spirit told me then is 'he is in a seater' He could be in a

swivel chair, in a plane seat heading for another country, in a car going

to east coast.

I will see now in the

next day or two if

the spirit still

persists in saying-ne is in a seater. If this be true then I think he is

dead in a tree or

dead in a bleachers at a fairgrounds where he hit when

he came down, but I have another great idea aboutittoo.

The fact of the matter is the spirit keeps saying and

especially Dec 3-

he is in a seater several times and

'he came down over a

fair'

thru several

times--The word car and the word Ford came

thru several

times. He dialed or called a

Jand something about a store or drugstorebo

where he called.

Since this word car and Ford began to bug me lately

b7C

then I think I

stumbled. on another lead.

This is really a kick in the

and wait until you see it and hear about it.

The day before the caper

the spirit had talked thar me about a spring, but I thot it was the spring

in my heater

that is on the bum and it also said something about a field.

I have a swell map of Oregon and I was looking at it and guess what I saw.

Boy is this deduction. Take

a look at the city map of Springfield, Oregon.

I never saw anything like it.

It looks like a car or a Ford and it even

has a seat in it where the Mckenzie River and Mohawk rivers cut into the

city center.

It looks like a seat in a car and the whole town,

the way it

is layed out looks like a Ford or a car.

Right north of the seat where

the seat is you will see on the map a park called Armitage state park.

This could mean the fair- the seat and

the car.

Isn't that the cats?

I imagine the area north of the seat

is wooded.

It sure is worth a try

and I consider it

a good lead.

I don't know if the plane path went thru

Springfield or not.

Maybe it

went close to it -better check this very

important clue. If he waited this long to bail out and didnt have

heavy clothing on then I would say he was a dumbell and was probably so

cold and frozen that he couldn't even pull the chute string and he is a

corpse laying down there someplace.

There is another angle to this case, too. People today are not nice

like they were in the twenties and thirties as a rule and if anybody has

found the corpse and the money the chances are that they would keep the

money and never report it. There may be a few honest people left however.

Ihope you have the

money marked with ultra- violet for black light.

If the Cooper guy is smart and really lives in Seattle area in a small

town and has the money HE will

probably cash

some of it in the Seattle

city center and not in his small town. A little at a time, or take a plane

out of the country.

I think he is a crackpot myself and I arrive at

decision thru the light clothes he was wearing and it just

might be he is

a corpse near Springfield, Oregon right now.

Sincerely,

b6

b7C

Yesterday the spirit talked thru me and

paris a couple or three

times and I started looking for a french

name like Rainier, Nash.

because Prince Rainier of Monaco has a principality near France, but

it proved to be another hijack at Paris.

It also said sewers a

couple

of times and I thot maybe the man landed near Seattle and hid the chutes

in a culvert or drainage ditch, but it rained down her and hence the

word sewers meant the coming rain would probably flood some sewers.

The followins is an editorial representing the opinion of

KPOK.

Much news of late has been devoted to the recent airline hi-

jacking between Portland and Seattle.

Many have marvelled at

the skill of the daredevil who schemed this crime. Some even

have gone so far as to say they would like the hijacker to

succeed ... to escape justice. Apparently these people have

let their emotions get caught up in the hoopla of this bizarce

plot, and the dreams of easy money.

I says, "the hijacker has won the public's admira-

tion through an awesome feat in the battle of man against the

nechine ... one individual overcoming, for the time being any

ray, technology, the corporation, the establishment, the

systen."

That may be so, but lest we fozget the facts of the case, this

hijacker did commit a crime ... a serious crime. What's more,

he jeopardized the safety of 42 other persons aboard that jet-

liner, and took something that did not belong to him. As one

local FBI agent put it, "Sone people may think this is funny,

but they won't be laughing if it happens again. It could giva

other criminals ideas, and this we surely don't need."

We hope law enforcement officers apprehend this hijacker soon,

and we urge the public to cooperate with clues, or in any other

way, that will see this person is held to ansuer for his crime.

Your contrary views are invited.

December 8, I97I.

F. B. I.

• :

Portiana, Oregon

Dear Friends:

I promised I wouldn't drop you any nore letters in regard to the

missing plane hi jacker for the $200,000. but I weakened again this

morning-Hed. the Öth of December.

I don't suppose you mind either 1f

I can supply information that might help you..

I guess I have written

about seven letters in all and most of them are supposition, but still

I am a spiritual man in a way and words that have kept coming thru me

may be helpful in the case.

If you put all the words together side by

side they sure make sense and fit together some way like a cross word

puzzle.

I think you will find this true in the end.

The trouble with

me is I an impulsive and try to work too hard on a case and might get

things all balled up in my own mind. I relaxed monday and tuesday and

was

going to forget the case, but tuesday nite, that was last nite I

was thinking again of the case and decided to put the parts together

again or try. to fit in the pieces. It was good for me to relax from

the case, because I contacted uy guardian angel jesterday and I haven't

been contacting her of late and she is very seldon wrong.. I remember

she contacted me at the first of the case and sald' he never made it

'he never made it.

That

would mean he is dead someplace in a field.

I heard the world field.

I was thinking last nite if I were the man and noticed that it

was getting cold in the plane. I would probably get ready to get

out in a hurry.

I would look at my money in the sack and go over

and open up a

parachute and get a rope or piece of clothe and tie 1t

up tight and then strap a parachute on my back and probably tie another

one on the front of me and get the heck out of there holding the bag

in one hand with my brief case inside the bag. The spirit also gave

me another word last nite--it said he connected-this means perhaps tha

he tied two parachutes together somehow. They might have become

Somewhere in the lapse of time.

I don't know the exact

glidepath of the plane, so I am hampered In

ACTION

entangles and he plumneted down to earth and died. The strange thing

is why hasnt he been found. I think the flying time for him was

between I2 minutes

that

respect, but somewhere in that lapse of

time

and space you will

probably find your man and I believe you will find him dead, because

I actually belleve he was a dumbell and not too snart. If he was

smart he would have dressed warmer and then too, he would have had

oals working with him on the ground. My latest belief then, is that

ne was a dumbell and is dead..

The apirit gave me a word last nite

and it was

'settlers'

I heard the word before the monday after the

сарет.

I was trying to figure what It meant and the nearest I can

figure 1t refers to a settlement, a wagon train, or emmigrant train.

There is the words -Lewis and Clark on the map near Marys Corner, Wast

It might mean the particular area where he fell was covered by early

settlers.

The word farmer came thru me and of course

connecued. ano

then those other words such as ford which could mean a rord car or it

in this case could mean to ford a river.. the word union could mean

two rivers and the word ferry could mean ferry accross the river.

I actually. belteve. now that He came down between two rivers.

The Deschutes and Skookumchuch and

of course the Nisqually riveny-look

important to me.

Probably between the Deschutes are &koakunchuck

rivers would be the place he came down and the word union meantabwo

rivers

and the word ford meant he had to ford them

Irohe Haspi ive

and made it then he forded a river and the word fat acuuld-merp-neat

I Sathering place such as a historical monument or liAria

could have been on the Lewis. and Jlark trail.

My Idea now, however, is that 1t was near Vall, Washington. À pinpoint

on the mape here would be a good idea.

As I said before, I contoled my

guardian

yesterday and as

concentrating on the subject she

said' Te didn't stay in ther long

I used to work in a small town called Grind Joulee in

There was a drug store that I used to go to for

in those days and the name of it was Vic and Vals.

That is why I said

Vall, lashiigton might be a good scene of operation.

by guardian

ingel yesterday said -have a malt.

She knows I

never have one any more.

That night I started to look at the map and there is this town called

Vall and a verson could fan out in what looks like some pretty

wild country around there along those three rivers.

That is there I

think now that he is down.

my the hellicopte's nave not ricked up

the chutes is a mystery.

It might take some hiking in there to find

The word narrow came thru me, too.

Maybe

a narrow neck

I am beginning to discount

that he ever got as far as Fortland ithout outside help.

I am beginning to believe he was a loner, altho the phrase c-me thru

me- He had four and then broke off.

That this means is a mystery to me.

I noticed that four men got aray at thoenix the other day in a lite

plane and left behind over a hundred thousand dollars worth of tarijuans.

I think this guy was a dope alrigit, because the spirit nas said - he

was a drugger-He ras a drugger.

he probably drank, too and I don't think he

very bright.

I think tre place to search, then, is east of Vall, lasa.

in an east and south or north direction along those rivers. I would

be willing to bet two dollard to a donut ( to a buraside) donut that I t:

right.

It might be that some firmer is going to find him or already has.

Some dishonest

person might bury him and the chute; and keep the hoard

of money. In this case I would look for the money if it ias maried to

show up in one of those small towns like Vall, Jinnesar or salkun or

tarys Jorner.

ky preference is Vall rignt at the present time.

The area

Test of Snoqualmie National Forest.

This reminds me too, of the spirit.

One

day it said near a Federal.

I didn't

get the last of the Phrase and

now this might de very important--Just west of snoqualmie tat'l. Forest

between the road leading along cinebar and north to the Skoskumehuch

and Deschutes River.

This looks hot to me now ind I almost feel like

doing some hiking myself and coming up ther and doing a little road work

myself, but guess I ron't.

My idea of curse is supposition, out you

can't go against the words that I hive and the phrises that came thru me.

Then you put all the words and phrases together, they mike sense.

I fly off on a tangent, sometimes and try to rush too fast into the enigma.

Right now I could almost draw a line between huckleberry mountain

and Vall and hit the jackpot in my mind's eye, horever.

Sincerely,

FBI - PORTLAND,

F. 3. 1.

Gentlemen:

Yesterday I dropped you a line or two ajout

the case of the

missing 1$200,000

air Jack.

I mentioned the word settler or settlers

had come thru me and today the vord railroad came thru me and I

rememben the word came thru me hhe nite of the Hijack. Just hat it

means I don't know,

but I started to make out a little

may showing

the railroads and I think the spirit felt sorry for me ind no 1

am sure I have the hottest clue to the case yet.

the word came thru

I think this is very definitely

It said 90 milest know the exact glide path of the

plane fror seaïtle-Tacon airport and I don't know for sure if I am

right with my crude map, but you might have an expert check the right

map and ascertain there the district is just (90-miles from Jeatile

airport).

I get it around the Kalima river rezion or possibly around

pigeon springs in Jowlitz county, lashington.

around Woodland and I get it about I2 miles or so above Hoodland.

The fact that the spirit said he was sitting in a seater night mean

he is sitting in a ditch or creek in there dead or then too, he might

be sitting in a swivel choir in some office laughing at the world with

the two hundred grand.

iccording to what my guardian angel said-

He wasn't in the plane long and

le never rade ltseens to really.

to me that 90 miles night be just about the right

distance, bec.uses

it don't take a plane long to fly this distance. Ho rany minutes

does it take?

Then the caper was first rulled about even two days

before it the spirit aè sroken thru me about a spring. Do you

remember 1a one of my first previous letters?

I thot it was a

spring down near vill city, but when I messured the distance on my

I thot the word union might

have meant to railroads or two rivers coming together.

Berteen

Rainier and loy lashirgton the N. P. runs a railroad line and then

another spur track runs below it and parallel to it as I have arn

on the map of mine.

I think the tip of the day now.

is the idea-

of 90-miles from takeoff.

Avery good siue.

Sometires I get

words that don't have inything to do with this case as for instance

two days suo I was walking don the street and the spirit said'suòs'

Ioday I sair the headlines in the paper-zussian sub fired on by

Pariston.

Then I wore up this morning the spirit manifested thru me

and said they are 'going to bons the buildings again'

This means

another rash oi bombings.

once before when the spirit said tils--

They bombed the 3ank of

America at Isle of Vista up near san erancisco.

Spirit also said

this morning that Fidel Justro as raiding us.

This means that sombedody from mainland Juba is slipping into our

country and is nighly skilled it the use of explosives.

I wisn I had a camp and about ID young men about or between the

age of 20 and

and I would train them to hive the holy ghost.

If I had it now I could tell you many thin s. It takes about a

year of training to produce men with the holy ghost and they will

never know under the existing conditions.

Hope my new clue spirit gave me (90 miles) will crack the case.

Sincereli,

DB Cooper-40758

I notice the southern Pacific runs a railrod conini in from the

furnished the following information

b7C

SNIDER, previous to his employment as a journeyman

lathe operator, started with the company as a general

beginner's helper, was promoted to drill press operator,

culminating with final position of lathe operator. His

occupation as lathe operator did not indicate that he was

skilled in the area of electronics, and in fact, Radiation

internatzonal, Inc did not manufacture any electronic

equipment or

components,

It was engaged

in prefabricating and

manufacturing various component parts to airplanes, such as

assemblies, door assemblies, etc. These parts were

manufactured

as

separate items, and in no way would a person

being employed at Radiation International be familiar with

the construction of the total airplane.

All recommendations

of supervisors of SNIDER at the time of his termination

were favorable, and there was nothing in SNIDER's personnel

file of an unfavorable nature.

No hobbies were indicated

in his personnel file, nor was

knowledgeable regarding

anyone employed by his plant who would have interests in

parachuting.

FLOYD I SNIDER was known to him as a quiet

FEI- PORTLAND

Reference: "D. B. Cooperl hijacking case.

Northwest Airlines Flight 305, 11/24/71, Portland-Seattle.

Gentlemen,

Since the writer patronizes various airlines in the course of my business,

I dont look forward to being on a hijacked plane at some future date.

Furthermore, I dont feel any "hero worship" toward the recent hijacker, as

some seen to do lately. I am interested only on apprehending the guilty

parties involved.

It is encouraging to note that the list of serial numbers of the $20

bills has been released.

On the other hand, fron a practical matter,

how am I or anyone else going to be able to check the bills in my own

possession from a 35-page list not readily available to the public?

I have a suggestion for your consideraion, and I hope that through

copies of this letter to the editors of the Oregonian and to the Oregon

Journal, they will both do their bit to promote the following:-

The prime unanswered question on this case at the moment is whether

the hijacker was successful and is alive and well somewhere spending

a part of his loot or whether there is an unopened parachute somewhere

attached to a corpse.

Obviously, when the first 20 dollar bill shows up

in trade somewhere, this question will be answered.

Instead of just a few bank and government employees looking for some of the

listed serial numbers, consider how many thousands of times more effective it

would be if the general public assisted you!

The quick and relatively inexpensive way to do this is for the government

to post the list in every major postoffice, along side the "men wanted"

posters and simultaneously through the press and TV, offer to purchase the

first ten (10) $20 bills turned in at $100.00 each!

What mae incentive

could you give the general public to participate? And what a pittance to

pay, as compared with the cost to date of your manhunt so far!

urther, many of my friends and possibly nost of the general public are

erronously under the impression that if they should find oneof these $20 bills

and attempt to report it, it will be confiscated as stolen property.

Consequently, no one has any serious thoughts of even looking for the

identified bills and would prefer to cover it up rather than report it, 1f

found.

Between your office with a purchase offer, and the news media,

you could really get a mass Inspection program going immediately! I am a

b6

b7C

ucerned citizen.

Sincerely yours
