Re: SEARCH

U.S. AIR FORCE 5R-71 AIRCRAFT

The Sacramento Division in a teletype dated

12/3/71 (Scr. 550) advised that Boale AFB, California,

had offered,

free of chargo to the Bureau, use of an

SR-71 aircraft to photograph terrain over which

the hijacked airplane had flown on its trip to reno.

This aircraft was described as an extremely

sophisticated aerial Icconnaissance plane which would

photograph a strip 20 niles wide with photographic resolution

of detecting objects on the ground 2 feet square. The

film strip would then be revieved by trained and gualified

Due to weather conditions along the route, being

inclenent at times, the flight never was made.

On 1/10/72 the writer contacted SAC JOIN HILLIANS,

Sacramento, and explained the results of the experiment

on 1/6/72.

LiT. WILLIAMS was requested to have the Air

Force contacted to see if the flight could be made only

over the State of Washington ana perhaps fron the Columbia

River to a point some 30 miles north. He was also asked

if the Air Force could advise what we could expect of such

an over flight in the way of infornation which would be

helpful in the search of this terrain.

In response to the above call, St

who has been handling the hijacking case at Sacramento,

advised he had contacted Beale AFB and made the request

for the over flight and that he would attempt to determine(

if it could be made, noting that weather conditions still

sub. F

are effective.

• The attached plot indicates the envelope of possible landing points of the high jacker (HJ).

It is based on the following:

Aircraft position from USAF radar data from McChord AFB furnished by

- Probable jump time (0411 GMT) from an analysis of the recorded communication

from the flight relative to the cabin pressure fluctuation. Flight tests conducted

on January 6 confirmed that the pressure fluctuation almost certainly occurred at

the time the HJ left the airplane,

- Wind information from 10,000' MSL to the ground as determined byL

- Human body trajectories from data furnished by The Boeing Company (free-fall)

andL

who is an expert para-

chutist.

- Time correlation from the above USAF radar information and from the NWA

communications network tape recording.

- Airplane airspeed and altitude from the airplane's flight recorder.

The plot is explained as follows:

1. The heavy dashed line C-D-E-S defines the airplane's probable ground track.

probate airplane ground trees tered on, he stated postin terence ter nost

nautical mile of the USAF radar plot.

3. Lines A-B, H-P, and O-R are the average wind vectors between 10,000' MSL and the

ground, and are the lines parallel to which the HJ would drift after the parachute had

opened.

4. Line H-S-T defines the northernmost (earliest) points over which the HJ probably

left the airplane. Line K-F-O defines the southernmost (latest) points over which

the HJ probably left the airplane. The north-south span of possible jump positions

is a product of the radar position tolerance of t.5 mile, and the possible communication

time determination tolerance of $1 minute.

5. The area within the boundary defined by Points H-P-Q-R-O-K-J-I-H marks the

extreme limits of probable landing points based on the above tolerances. That is, assuming

the highest probable degree of inaccuracy in aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, etc.,

all probable HJ landing points would lie within the area defined by this line.

6. If it is assumed aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, and other inputs used are ali

accurate (without allowance for the above stated tolerances):

a. The HJ's landing point would be at Point A if his 'chute did not open, or if he

opened it so soon that the high speed caused 'chute damage that resulted in the

equivalent of a free-fall to the ground. (The horizontal body trajectory due to

able to make the simulated flight on 12/27/71.

I told him we would bring all of the maps and material that we

had which has a bearing on this so that we can decide how the

flight will take place.

He advised that the airplane would be avail-

able for the flight around 4:30 PM. He asked that we make the

arrangements for the dumny and the actual drop itself. He

will make all the arrangements for the airplane.

told me, contrary to our earlier

belief, that the crew told him that they could see the lights

of Portland and other distinctive lights

; in that area,

given knowledge of the specific area the hijacker could very

easily have made a jump to a specific location.

to Seattle,

Washington, from Portland, Oregon.

The

airplane

landed at Seattle where the hijacker requested $200,000.00

and four parachutes, two chest packs and two back packs. After

the money was delivered to the hijacker in a knapsack, passengers

and two of the stevardesses were allowed to deplane.

At Seattle the hijacker had specified there were

to be no police or fire equipment when the plane landed.

He

requested an unmarked car and a representative of the airline

would be allowed to approach the aircraft from a ten o'clock

relative position. The only other equipment to go near the

aircraft was to be the air stairs and refueling equipment.

At takeoff the hijacker had directed the aircraft

to be flown at 10,000 feet with the rear door down, and flaps

and landing gear down.

Direct cormunications between crew and MSPFO maintained at

all times. Coordination between Tower, vehicles, and air-

plane on ground at SEA were on Ground Control frequency 121.7.

First fuel truck apparently ran out of fuel. Crew requested

second truck, with third one to be standing by. Considerable

delay in getting full load of fuel and liJ was getting "nervous",

silying that you must "get the shot on the road".

hI specified that he wanted to go to Mexico City non-stop,

that

the aircraft configuration must be gear DOIN, 'flaps at

15°, that the aft entry door must be open at all times, and

that

the aft stairs be extended after take-off. Later

• specí-

fied that stairs must be fully extended before take-off.

NSPFO advised crew (1) that non-stop SEA-MEX impossible with

gear DOWN, flaps 150, (2) that take-off with air-stairs full

down impossible due to inability to rotate airplane. Then

HJ advised of this he asked that air-stairs be partially ex-

tended prior to take-off. NSPFO advised this also impossible

since stairs could not be held in any intemediate position.

HJ had previously stated that no landing within continental

U.S. would be permitted "for fuel or anything else".. then

advised of range limitation in his specified configuration,

he agreed to something short of the border. Asked about PHX.

Advised by MSPFO that this might be within range but that

RHO would be better as far as range was concerned. Agreed

to this without much, if any, objection.

Crew given prelimin

axy information on optimum range IS (170K), weather, air-

ports available between Sis and RHO, minimum obstruction

etc."

MSPFO asked for stewardess best recollection of exact content

of lJ briefcase. She got on radio and gave following basic

information:

- Bight red sticks, about 6" x 1" in left corner of brief

. case, "look like big firecrackers." Iwo rows of sticks,

four on top of four.

- Wire attached to dynamite with red insulation.

- Battery "like flashlight battery, but about 6" high and

as big around as my arm".

- Red sticks are about the color "of my uniform"'.

Crew called liJ and asked him if everything was O.K. and he

replied that it was. This was appatently the last communi-

cation the crew had with the liJ.

Cren reported oscillation of cabin rate of climb indicator.

This probably due to hiJ reight now on stairs, stairs extending

further, resultant effect on cabin pressure.

detected by the pilot were it not for the fact that the plane

was on

He continued, however,

and said he had examined minutely the flight recorder record

and was unable to detect any similar occurrence in the airplane

of this very likely there would be no other logical place

PARACHUTE:

For record purposes, I called SAC WHALEY at Albuquerque

on 11/29/71, and told him I understood that there was a

research project at Honloman Air Force Base in New Mexico

dealing with the effect on a body of high altitude parachuting

and the effect of low temperatures on a body in case a jump

was made.

I asked him to see if he could contact the

person responsible for the survey to give us some notions about

what effect this would have on the man making this jump.

I told him that the weather was clear to 1500 feet,

broken clouds to 5,000, solid above, and that the jump was

possibly made around 7,000 to 10,000 ft. at a time when the

"total average temperature" was minus 7 degrees.

however, he does not believe that the association maintains

these photos although they do maintain descriptions.

He said that with a lighted target, a man could

come within 1000 feet of the target from the height that

were flying on the night in question, and that you could

guide yourself as much as 45 degrees

in either direction with

a plain survival type parachute, if you had the knowledge.

He stated that theyhave been passing information

on to us based on the "pressure bump" indicating that the

man had jumped north of Portland. He said it was entirely

possible that the man did not jump when this "pressure bump"

took place. It was entirely possible that he sat on the

end of the stairs to check out his reference points before

he jumped.

If he did this for even a short time, he could

have easily landed across the river in Oregon.

He pointed out in this connection that there is

Aurora Field near Donald, Oregon.

Package Copy: Being forwarded under separate cover is

original airline ticket (1B21) and one snap on black tie with

gold tie clip (1B7) .

Enclosures:

Original Laboratory reports regarding above items.

Details: As the Laboratory is aware, captioned case involves the

hijacking of Northwest flight 305 destined for Seattle on

11/24/1971 by an unknown subject. In spite of exhaustive

investigation over the years,

the subject remains unidentified.

This case has national significance and remains the only

unresolved airplane hijacking in U.s. history.

As this was a

capital offense at the time, no statute of limitation exists.

Retrieval of any DNA could be very useful as a DNA profile could

be used to eliminate subjects that'

are still being brought to the

attention of Seattle

The above items were originally submitted to the

Laboratory in late 1971

for fingerprint analysis (ticket) and

manufacture analysis (tie and clip) with negative results.

No DNA

testing was ever done.

Prior reports from the LAB related to the

examination of the tie and clip are attached for reference. As

these

are the only items absolutely known to have been handled by

the UNSUB in this case, they are being resubmitted at this time

for DNA analysis. If appropriate, and following the DNA work,

the ticket (1B21) should be also

resubmitted for latents.

where part of D.B. Cooper's loot was lound Sunday

are kicking themselves for not building more sand

They aiso wonder whether they should have paid

more attention to the sand dredging operations along

Tina Bar is a stretch of sandy beach on the

Washington side of the Columbia River northwest of

Vancouver. The lonely country road that winds along

the beach, Lower River Road, dead-ends about three

miles iron where a Vancouver family found about

$3,000 beneath the sand Sunday

while on a picnic.

Rabbits bounce on the side of the road at night, startl-

• ed by occasional passing cars.

Less than 10 houses are along the 12-mile stretch of

beach road. Most of the land belongs to large dairy

farms. The Fazio Bros. Sand Co. also fronts the river.

A road leading through the Fazio gate is a popular

path to the beach. It is the same path used by the

family the day they found the money. On the east side

of Fazio Bros. is Leeward Isle Marina, with a public

fishing boat launch and one or two house boats.

During fishing season, the beach is packed from

, end to end, say local residents Clarence and Barbara

Ellis. They have lived in their mobile home just down

¿ the road from Fazio Bros. for the past 30 years.

Every day Clarence takes his outboard skilt along

"Tina Bar patrolling the river and the beach for

renegade logs that could damage other boats.

Ellis says that the Army Corps of Engineers con-

tinuously dredges sand directly off the shore from

where the money was found.

"I betcha that dredging brought that money up and

most of it's been destroyed by the dredging," he said.

• "Even the FBl is going to be able to figure that one

Today a spokesman for the Army Engineers said l

they were working closely with the FBl, checking out

that lead. The sand sucked up from the bottom of the

river and spewed onto the beach could have contain-

ed some or all of the long-sought money. While the

dredging is continuous,

the last time sand was

deposited in that spot was in October 1974.

Another resident of the area said that the money

was found too far from the water to have washed up.

"It had to be the dredging. Maybe I'll go get me a

shovel," said Mirs. J.W. Freeman.

The FBI dug all day Tuesday, finding bits and

pieces of $20 bills. An agent guarding the site Tuesday

evening said the amount they found during. the day

was less than the $3.000 orginally dug up.

Tuesday night the Ellis tamily sat in their home

decorated with fishing gear and large plants, amazed

that some the D.B. Cooper money was showing up on

the same beach their children grew up on.

"To think I worked like a slave all my life and here

this money was right in my front yard," said Ellis.

"When I think of the times my kids took the four-

wheel drive right over that spol. I mean that's our

beach. It belongs to the people we lease from and

that's the beach we use."

His wife, Barbara, said she felt "kinda sick" not

finding it. But she added that she would have turned it

in. "Somebody could have lost it," she said.

The beach proverty actually belongs to the Hans

Egger family of Vancouver. A baby sitter at the home

said the Eggers were on vacation in California. They

learned the money had been found on their propert;

when they listened to a television newscast Tuesday

"They were shocked," said the baby sitter

"The discovery of the money

The fact that the money appears

Re meme of SA

7/5/78.

Contact made with the Identification Staff at the

King County Sheriff's Office revealed that no facility was

available for searching a latent print through an establishe

file of known criminals.

On 7/25/78, contact made with the Seattle Police

Department, Seattle, Washington, determined that a computerized

system is

established at the Seattle Police Department whereby

a latent print, containing sufficient detail, could be classi-

fied and

compared with the impressions of known individuals in

this file.

On this same date 7/25/78, the photographs of 78

latent prints and one latent impression were furnished to the

Jof, the Seattle Police

Department for search in their computerized file. She stated

that she would notify the agent as to when the search was

completed.

Enclosed herewith for Seattle is a parcel

For information of Seattle,

"The Oregon Journal,"

Portland daily newspaper, has been publishing a series

of articles concerning captioned matter.

These articles

have generated considerable public interest. As a result

of this publicity, l

→ furnished

the tollowing information:

During approximately October, 1973,!

went on a hike on Mt. Hood, approximately forty miles east of

Portland, Oregon.

Walking

• on an established trail, he spied

a few pieces of what appeared to be nylon material in a small

opening

a short distance off the trail.

He examined the

material,

which appeared to possibly be from a parachute.

He cut off several pieces of the nylon cord and brought

them home with him.

It is realized that this location is too far

from the scene of the hijacker's jump to be logically

elated to this case. However, In view of the intens

current public interest and the fact that

furnished

his information first to

"The Oregon Joumal" which trans-

mitted it to the Portland Otrice, it is lelt further

investigation should be conducted.

Recalling that the parachute rigger in this

the enclosed material

from the parachutes furnished the hijacker.

In view of

interest

of the newspaper in resolution of any leads

generated by them, it is requested results be furnished

The following background infermation is being

Unsub had with him prior

to the time he jumped the following:

A.

Parachute Back Pack

B.

Parachute Chest Pack'

C.

Briefcase or attache case

Dark overcoat

E.

A 4x12x14 paper bag

F.

A pair of dark slip-on shoes.

G.

Wrap around sunglasses with dark rims.

H. 10,000 $20 bills.

Since none of the above was found when the plane

was searched at Reno, Unsub must have taken them with him,

or discarded some of them prior to jumping.

The above-described attache case

supposedly con-

tained a bomb. It is believed Ungub threw this attache case

from the plane prior to his jumping, because of the numerous

other items he had to carry. 'If he did throw it prior to

jumping, it would fall almost directly in the path of the

aircraft. The 727 air stairs were lowered sometime after

7:42 p.m. and Unsub jumped prior to 8:15 p.m. on November 24,

•The plane covered a distance of approximately 87 miles

during this time.

would be able to provide expert information

concerning the feasibility of using high resolution infrared

or regular photographic equipment in a low flying aircrait

to locate the attache case or any other of the above-described

items Unsub may have discarded prior to jumping.

The items could possibly be lodged in thickly

wooded, mountainous terrain. The search area would cover

a strip of land approximately 87 miles long by one-half

mile wide. It has been suggested that infrared photography

might possibly indicate non-living material, such

as an

attache case, in a, darker shade than living

material, thereby

enabling the case to be found using infrared high resolution

photography.

Since Unsub possibly discarded the attache case

length of time Unsub would have to throw the case or

Re Las Vegas letter to the Bureau dated 11/26/71

and report from the Identification Division dated 11/29/71,

copies of which were furnished to Seattle and Portland.

The report fron the Identification Division made

reference to 11 transparent lifts apparently submitted to

the Identification Division by Las Vegas letter of 11/26/71.

this report indicated that the latent prints on the submitte

lifts mere of no value.

If Seattle was furnished a copy of

Las Vegas letter 11/26/71, submitting latents, we are unable

to locate it at this time.

Las Vegas is therefore requested to submit to

Seattle, thrce Xerox copies of Las Vegas letter dated

11/26/71.

Specimens received from FBI, Seattle 4/27/72:

ALSO SUBMITTED: Three photocopies made from microfilm of

ransom bills bearing serial numbers

• L 54904730 A, L 33529797 A and L 20168977 A

Result of examination:

The bills represented by Q43 were compared with

corresponding bills represented by K4. In the comparison,

photographic overlays of the Q43 bills showed the serial

numbers on these bills to be out of register with the serial

numbers on the K4 bills.

The examination definitely determined that the Q43

bills are not a part of the ransom money represented by the

K4 microfilm.

K4 is returned herewith.

Appropriate photographs

made from K4 and the ALSO SUBMITTED items are retained.

Dear. Six:

This will confirm an opinion given on February

parachutes which were involved in this case.

The hijacker of Northwest Airlines Flight $305

vas given four parachutes while the plane was on the ground

at Scattle-Tacona International Airport.

Tro of these

parachutes were apparently used by the nijacker hen he

parachuted fron the plane.

The remaining two parachutes

were still on the nlane when it landed at Reno, Nevada.

One of the parachutes was intact, but the other had been

opened and three of the shroud liner had been cut.

Northuest Airlines, Minneapolis,

contacted the Seattle Office

on Fabruary 3, 1972, to inquire

as to the disposition of the

two parachutes which had been

left on the plane. D

aivised he has been Iccoiving

inquiries fron the porson ino

supplica the parachutes cither

to have the parachutes roturned to hin, or have forthwest

Re: RANSOM MONEY

The ransom money obtained by Northwest Airlines

original roll of film contained on one reel, was picked up

by SAL

United Airlines courier.

Since the above roll of film

contained the serial numbers of $230,000, it was necessary

to furnish the serial numbers of the $30,000 which was not

included in the ransom (the ransom being

$200,000).

Because the Laboratory was having difficulty with

eliminating the serial numbers, they reguested we obtain

the complete list of serial numbers which vere deleted from

the original listing of the $230,000.

In the meantime, the

had prepared another amount of

ranson money of $230,000

and included in that, the $30,000 which had been taken

from the first ransom money as mentioned in paragraph one

above.

then loaned to us,

two reels

of microfilm which contains their current ransom

money and which included the bills which had been taken from

the first ransom money. These two rolls of microfilm were

sent to the Laboratory and were used to compile an accurate

list of the ransom money given to the hijacker.

All three reels of film returned by the Bureau

with the following dispositions:

On this date,

the below listed individuals examined

a Boeing

Aircraft, Type 727, which belongs to Northwest Orient

Airlines, and which had been utilized as their flight number 305

on that date. This examination took place at 11:25 P.M. at the

Municipal Airport in Reno, Nevada.

Prior to the initiation of this search, information had

been furnished to the below agents by a member of the crew

-"who had flown this airplane into the Reno airport to the effect

that the unknown subject involved in the hi-jacking of this

airplane had been seated in the rear right-hand window seat

of this plane.

Upon boarding this aircraft, it was determined that the

rear row of seats on this airplane were numbered 18, and the

right window 'seat was designated 18F.

On the seat numbered 18E

a black clip-on tie was observed. This black tie contained a

contained a sern on white label with the notation SSS # 5 and

COSS. This flap had also been stenciled with the name JoHNsoN.

An opened parachute which apparently had been removed

from the canvas parachute cover described above was found spread

out over seats 17C and 17B. This parachute was of a pink-orange

color.

On seat 18B, an unopened back type parachute was

In the presence of the reporting Agent,

these men examined

said parachute, and announced that prior

to its having been released from its container by someone

pulling the rip cord, it was in operational condition and

could have been utilized for a parachute jump. They advised

that someone had cut the ltnes attaching the chute itself to

the canvas pack it was originally pacled in. They also noted

that while the nylon chute itself was in good condition, two

of the 24 nylon lines attaching same to the canvas pack had

been cut and removed. They advised that this type of parachute

was gonerally used by aky jumpers Inasnuch as the pilot chute

had been removed and removal was noted on the inspection card

contained In a pocke ot the canvas pack.

This card identified

the parachuto as a 24 loot Ripstock type; DA-58-53912 as the

serial number; manufactured in October 1959; owned by the

stated that his expert opinion that

said parachute was in operational condition prior to its release

iron its canvas pack by the pulling of the rip cord was contingent

on the fact that no one had opened and repacked said parachute

I, S. COSSEY as noted on the inspection card record contained

In the canvas pack at time of his examination. He advised that

all riggers of parachutes are licensed and when they sign the

Inspection card they are certifying that said parachute is packed

so as to be in a life saving condition.

Therefore, he is of the

opinion that whoever pulled the rip cord and released the chute

from its canvas pack,

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription 12/7/71

On November 25,

1971,

Seattle-First National Bank,

the head office being in

Seattle, Washington, provided the

following information:

upon being advised of the iden-

tity of the writer, handed the writer a film canister contain-

ing a microfilm, upon which the serial numbers of $250,000

worth of notes were recorded. He advised that of the $250,000

worth of notes, the Federal

Bureau of Investigation should only

be concerned with the $20 bills, that is the serial numbers of

the $20 bills, because the hijacker received only $20 bills.

stated that there are $230,000 worth of $20 bills

recorded on the microfilm.

advised that in order

for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine the

serial numbers of the $20 bills which the hijacker actually

received, we must subtract serial numbers which he provided

me fron the total list of serial numbers on the microfiln.

provided a list of serial numbers

of $20 totaling $30,000 worth of notes, which, although they

were on the microfilm itself, were not

part of the $200,000

worth of $20 bills which the

hijacker received. L

stated that the bank packs $20 bills in packages of 1000

Each packet therefore contains $2,000 worth of $20 bills.

provided the first and last serial number in each

of these $20 bill packets and advised that we should subtract

both"of these numbers, as well 'as the 98, serials nunders

between each of these groups of numbers in order to determine

the actual serial numbers of the bills which the hijacker

received. Thèse groups of numbers are as follows:

• L42197159A thru E12561828B;

L33639577A thru L20458572A

J02051511 thru I00466866

in the vicinity where the money was found to be in approximately

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer, and below that an older sand layer. The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money.

This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were not severely damaged or rusted. The

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and splkes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump (dreâge) sand was a mix-

ture of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size. Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the

based this belief on three facts. The first

fact being that the money was rounded off on the corners, which

would indicate a rolling motion and would indicate the flow:

of the river.

The second fact was that the money was found

in the surface

layer of the upper reworked beach sand.

third fact was that the distribution of the money was in

this surface layer only, and none was found to be in the

post dredging sand.

stated that the condition of the rubber bands would

tend to lend credence to the assumption that the money had

been at the location where found a longer period of time.

Even

with this, he still felt the money was not at the site for more

than a year. At the height found, the money was definitely de-

posited more than four years after the dredging of the Columbia

River in 1974.

did not work its way up through the post dredging sand to the

advised that this could be caused by many reasons, but most

probably caused by the different elevations of the beach sand

at the time the dredging occurred.

Regarding the fact that the money itself was remark-

ably well preserved, I

Jadvised that sand is sterile,

and in nature, is probably the best preservative of any soil.

This could also be the reason that the rubber bands were still in

place around the money, although they were badly deteriorated, and

would also lead credence to the fact that the money had been

deposited in sand the major portion of the time since it was
