Dear Sir:

I would like for you to furnish me with what information

is available on the person D. B. Cooper, known as the missing

sky-jacker.

As to possibly his age, height and weight. Did

he wear any western clothes at the time? Do you know if he

had any indian connections at the time?

And is there a reward

offered for his apprehention?

I am aware of a prime suspect, who spent a large sum

of money after this sky-jacking took place and no one knows

where the money came from.

I would appreciate this information as soon as possible,

or you may have an agent contact me at my home.

l. Is there a reward offered for his apprehension?

Yes, a negotiable reward through the insurance

company for Northwest Orient Airlines and vari-

ous northwest newspapers may be available, only

after such time as the FBI verifies the infor-

mation and handles this matter through the

federal court system.

A summary of the violation is as follows:

THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male boarded

Northwest Orient Flight

#305 at Portland, Oregon. At appro-

ximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight was en route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated to the stewardes's that his brief

case contained a bomb which would blow up the plane unless

his demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36 passengers aboard the

plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seattle, Northwest Orient

Airlines complied with his instructions. After he received

the parachutes and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers

and the two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into

the first-class section of the aircraft and informed them

he desired to fly to Mexico City.

The hijacker instructed

that the plane proceed in a southerly direction and fly at

a low altitude and slow speed which would enable the rear

door of the plane to be opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the hijacker,

two parachutes, and the ransom money had disappeared when

the plane was

inspected

at Reno, Nevada.

PORTLAND (UPI) - Ralph

Himmelsbach, the Federal Bureau

Investigation agent who has

headed the D.B. Cooper case since

the 1971 hijacking, outlines this

"possible scenario

to explain how

some of the Cooper

money

washed up on the beach west of

Vancouver:

"Probably the money (in the

bag) came down close to the bank

of a stream. When the water got

high

enough it washed down-

stream,

bumping along the bot-

tom. The bag imally degraded.

"Perhaps it could have burst on

impact, but that is not likely. We

think finally, tumbling down the

river bottom, it broke open and

the money was carried on, wear-

ing off little bits and pieces around

the edges, grinding it down like it

mystery surrounding D.B

Cooper's skyjacking and

disappearance eight years

ago has been rekindled by a

Vancouver, Wash., family's inad-

vertent discovery of worn packets

of $20 bills on the Columbia River

shoreline — part of Cooper's $200,-

000 ransom.

The saga which changed the

nature of airline piracy began on

SUBs Bil

Thanksgiving Day,

1971,

when

Cooper

boarded Northwest Air-

lines flight 305 for a flight from

Portland to Seattle. Once aboard,

he handed a crew member a note,

saying he was carrying a bomb in a

satchel and

wanted $200,000 in

unmarked $20 bills.

When the jetliner landed at the

Seattle-Tacoma International Air-

port that evening, authorities had

arranged the cash and had also

obtained four parachutes, as in-

structed by Cooper.

Cooper then allowed the flight's

36 passengers and all crew mem-

bers but two pilots and one stew.

disembark. He then

ordered the aircraft to take oss for

Reno, Nev.

At. one point in that flight, the

crew felt a fluctuation 'in cabin

liner's rear cabin door had opened.

Cooper parties will

continue in Ariel

By Fran Kaiser

The Daily News Staff Writer

• ARIEL - The party will go on — whether D.B. Cooper is found or

not.

That assurance is from Laurel Fisher, owner of the Ariel Store

and Tavern, where legend seekers gather each November to fete

the famous skyjacker.

"We'll probably have the party forever," said Laurel, who spent

the morning hosting television crews from as far away as Los

Angeles after some of Cooper's loot was found near Vancouver.

Even if Cooper is found dead the party will continue as a

memorial, she said.

"It means something to everyone up here. It's a legend. He sort

of put Ariel on the map."

Authorities believe Cooper bailed out of the hijacked Boeing 727

near Lake Merwin in the area east of Woodland. Neither he nor

$200,000 in loot was ever seen - until some of the money appeared

Tuesday.

The money caused excitement in the small community on the

• Lewis River near Merwin Dam. Despite the find, some Ariel

residents still say maybe Cooper dropped some of his money, but

got away.

Laurel and her husband, David, bought the store 15 months ago,

and continued the traditional party started by the former owner.

Not ta cope towed i to at or me parano

About 300 people showed up for last November's party. Some

perhaps, hoped Cooper himself might be lured to the celebration if

he's alive.

He's never shown, but he has an open invitation.

Found

Loot!

Kids Dig Up

Hijack Cash

By Neil Modie •

More than eight years after D.B.

Cooper parachuted into rainy dark-

ness from a hijacked airliner, part of

his $200,000 loot was found buried in a

river bank near Vancouver, Wash., the

EBl announced yesterday.

Badly weathered and apparently

washed ashore from the Columbia

River, the stacks.of $20 bills say noth-

ing encouraging about the fate of the

legendary hijacker.

"It can tell you a number of things

- either he dropped the money or

he's dead," commented John D: Prin-

gle, assistant special agent in charge

of. the FBI office in Seattle. "We can't

f tell at this point."

For Ralph Himmelsbach of Port-

land, the FBI agent in charge of the

(investigation since it began, the dis:

covery reinforces his opinion that

Cooper died after he parachuted from

Himmelsbach said the find re-

duced to

"less than 50 - 50" the odds

• that Cooper is still alive.

The money was found Sunday by

an 8-year-old Vancouver boy, Brian

Ingram, and his 5-year-old cousin,

Denise, as they were digging in the

sand with sticks along the river bank

during a family outing.

"This clue is the first we've had

since the night of the occurrence,"

said Bill Baker, assistant special agent

in charge of the Portland office,

which the Ingram family contacted on

Monday.

The money was found about 25

miles southwest of the area where the

FBI had thought it most likely Cooper

landed after he parachuted from the

jetliner into a freezing rainstorm on

Nov. 24, 1971.

The hijacker, who had used the

name "Dan Cooper" to buy his airline

ticket, boarded the jet in Portiana,

threatened to blow it up with what he

claimed was a bomb in his briefcase,

then forced it to land in Seattle to.col

lect the ransom.

Cooper allowed 36 passengers

aboard the flight to leave, then or-

dered the crew of four to fly it to

Reno after $200,000 in marked bills

and four parachutes demanded by the

hijacker were brought on board.

As the southbound airliner passed

over Southwest Washington, the hi-

jacker — wearing only a business suit

and street shoes - parachuted

through a rear stairwell door.

As "Dan Cooper" became a legend,

the name "D.B. Cooper" - as an FBI.

agent had initially identified him -

became the name that stuck.

The FBI said his chances of sur-

vival were slim because he was

lightly dressed for jumping into a

howling wind and a freezing rain in af

parachute not likely to work.

Agents have theorized that his

remains are at the bottom. Permike

The long frustrated FBI made

simultaneous announcements of the

The crumbling stacks of $20 bills,

who dug it out of the sand, were put

on display at an FBI press conference

bear serial numbers identical to a por-

of the FBI's Seattle office, said in a

But D.B. Cooper put the town

last night the telephones at the

Ariel happens to be near Lake

Merwin, and a number of theorists

suggested that Cooper might have

gone into the reservoir behind the

Arle dam.

Since 1976 the Ariel Tavern has

hosted an annual D.B. Cooper par-

ty or November 24, the anniversa-

ry of the hijacking in 1971. Every

year 200 to 300 people have shown

up to eat buffalo stew and see

whether Cooper would answer the

the moldering money, about

After that, Fisher said, "It was

• Fisher said he had been on the

Only about 20 or 30 patrons

man

calling

himself Dan Cooper bought a

ticket for a Northwest Airlines

Shortly after takeoff,

he

handed a note to stewardess

Florence Schaffner.

Thinking the man was s1-

motioned for her to read it.

The note said

he had a

Mexico.

While the jet circled Seattle

before landing, the skyjacker

also ordered that $200,000 cash

and four parachutes be

brought to the plane.

The airline agreed,

Beach residents

groan

By Donna duBeth

The handful of residents who live along the beach

where part of D.B. Cooper's loot was found Sunday

are kicking themselves for not building more sand

They also wonder whether they should have paid

more attention to the sand dredging operations along

Tina Bar is a stretch of sandy beach on the

Washington side of the Columbia River northwest of

Vancouver. The lonely country road that winds along

the beach, Lower River Road, dead-ends about three

miles from where a Vancouver family found about

$3,000 beneath the sand Sunday while on a picnic.

Rabbits bounce on the side of the road at night, startl-

- ed by occasional passing cars.

Less than 10 houses are along the 12-mile stretch of

beach road. Most of the land belongs to large dairy

farms. The Fazio Bros. Sand Co. also fronts the river.

A road leading through the Fazio gate is a popular

path to the beach. It is the same path used by the

family the day they found the money. On the east side

of Fazio Bros. is Leeward Isle Marina, with a public

fishing boat launch and one or two house boats.

During fishing season, the beach is packed from

a end to end, say local residents Clarence and Barbara

Ellis. They have lived in their mobile home just down

the road from Fazio Bros. for the past 30 years.

Every day Clarence takes his outboard skiff along

Tina Bar patrolling the river and the beach for

renegade logs that could damage other boats.

Ellis says that the Army Corps of Engineers con-

tinuously dredges sand directly off the shore from

where the money was found.

"I betcha that dredging brought that money up and

ed some or all of the long-sought money. While the

deposited in that spot was in October 1974.

Another resident of the area said that the money

was found too far from the water to have washed up.

"It had to be the dredging. Maybe I'll go get me a

shovel," said Mrs. J.W. Freeman.

The FBI dug all day Tuesday, finding bits and

pieces of $20 bills. An agent guarding the site Tuesday

evening said the amount they found during. the day

was less than the $3,000 orginally dug up.

Tuesday night the Ellis family sat in their home

decorated with fishing gear and large plants, amazed

that some the D.B. Cooper money was showing up on

the same beach their children grew up on.

"To think I worked like a slave all my life and here

this money was right in my front yard," said Ellis.

"When I think of the times my kids took the four-

wheel drive right over that spot. I mean that's our

beach. It belongs to the people we lease from and

that's the beach we use."

His wife, Barbara, said she felt "kinda sick" not

finding it. But she added that she would have turned it

in. "Somebody could have lost it," she said.

The beach property actually belongs to the Hans

Egger family of Vancouver. A baby sitter at the home

said the Eggers were on vacation in California. Thes

learned the money had been found on their property

when they listened to a television newscast Tuesday

"They were shocked," said the baby sitter.

FBI ending hunt

for Cooper cash

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) - The search along a

*Columbia River beach for more money from the D.B.

¿Cooper hijacking eight years ago probably will be

"suspended after today, FBI officials said Thursday.

Meanwhile, a geologist concluded that several thou-

#sand dollars found Sunday by an 8-year-old boy on a

*family picnic was deposited on the beach in the past

« year or two.

FBI agents continued to dig for more of the $200,000

*that Cooper took with him when he bailed out of a plane

* on Thanksgiving Eve in 1971.

The search began Tuesday along the river's north

* shore, about three miles southwest of downtown Vancou-

'ver. Additional scraps of money were found on Wednes-

a day.

A man whose passenger list was signed "Dan

; Cooper" left a Northwest Airlines plane that was bound

• for Reno, Nev., from Seattle after he displayed what

appeared to be a bomb and obtained a package of $20

*bills and three parachutes.

FBI agents believed he left the plane, during a

• Storm, about 20 miles northeast of where the crumbled

and weathered pis were found.

It is the nation's.oniy unsolved hijacking.

"We'll work today and tomorrow and probably knock

"it off and bring my troops back up here and reassess the

§ situation," said Jack Pringle, assistant agent in charge

gof the Seattle office which took over the search

operations.

"Some of the area is inaccessible and there's no way

"we can search the whole river," Pringle said.

11

He said geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State

University concluded that the dredging operation in 1974

did not put the money onto the beach, because the bills

were found above clay deposits put on the banks by the

dredge.

Brian Ingram, when scooping out a place for a

campfire, found the money, tied together by rubber

bands in three clumps, under a thin layer of sand.

The bills were matched to the Cooper loot by serial

numbers.

-Dan Cooper bill

Brian ingram, the &-year-old van

couver, Wash., boy who discovered

some of the Dan Cooper skyjacking ran-

som last week, was not given one of the

deteriorated bills, as was reported tues-

day in soine editions of The Oregonian.

The boy actually was given a $20

bill made to look like one of the tattered

bills, in addition to a certificate praising

him for his find. Both items came from

the Hough Elementary School PTA.

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., FBI

laboratory technicians have been unable

to determine how much money was in

the three bundles of Cooper's recovered

as a result of young ingram's find.

"The $20 bills were so badly deteri-.

orated that we have been unable to

"count it," said FBI spokesman Otis Cox.

* He said no fingerprints were found on

• the bills.

The bills were identified as part of

Cooper's $200,000 by their serial num-

bers.

RE: D.D. Cooper

I had the pleasure, or should I say the opportunity of talking to D.D. Cooper

in Portland Oregon, in a night club, right after his celebrated Hijacking, in which

he parachuted out of an airplane, and into history.

It was actually a chance meeting, but he was talking to me in a low voice about

now he did'nt need the money, only the prestigue of knowing that the F.B.l. coula

be had, he stated to me that the I.B.I. only respect a sharp. and wise criminal,

and that the sharper you are the less

crime that you do.

D.D. Cooper mentioned to me that the latest pictures of him in the paper were not

accurate, and that he was going to have Plastic Surgery, his words were Cosmetic Surgery.

D.D. Cooper was the coolest man that I had ever met, he seemed so professional;

RE: D.D. Cooper

I had the pleasure, or should I say the opportunity of talking to D.D. Cooper

in Fortland Oregon, in a night club, right after his celebrated Hijacking, in which

he parachuted out of an airplane, and into history.

,It was actually a chance meeting, but he was talking to me in a low voice about

now he did'nt need the money, only the prestigue of knowing that the F.B.I. could

be had, he stated to me that

the F'.B.I. only respect a sharp. and wise criminal,

and that the sharper you are the less crime that you do.

D.D. Cooper mentioned to me that the latest pictures of him in the paper were not

accurate, and that he was going to have Plastic Surgery, his words were Cosmetic Surgery.

aDo Cooper was the coolest man that I had ever met, he seemed so professional;

he talked of pulling one more job, on the level of the great Brinks robbery,

was to be done in las Vegas, because he stated that few people had ever pulled off

a big heist in las Vegas, and lived to tell acout it; I replied; D.D. That's lafia

you're talking about, and he said yeah, I know, that's what keeeps me

motivated.

I'II say one thing for D.D. he loves Tatoos, he has them all over his arms, and legs.

He clairs that he paid a fortune to have them did when he was in the army.

I could go on talking about D.D. Cooper all day, but I must close now;

For DaD. Along with former President Richard M. Nixon are like so many other

self-tortured souls who are vengeful of the I.B.I. for turning them down, when

they so desperately wanted to be a member of the F.B.I.

VANCOUVER, Wash. - Human skeletal remains found in a rough

section of Southwest Washington are those of a teen-age girl and not

the bones of D.B. Cooper, the airline hijacker, said Federal Bureau of

Investigation officials yesterday.

Special Agent John Pringle said Dr. Arch Hamilton, Clark County

coroner, determined the skull found near the western boundary of the

Giftord Pinchot National Forest belonged to a young girl.

Pringle said the girl's age or identity has not been determined.

The skull and other bones were found Sunday by Jack Bannister, of

Yacolt, Clark County, and his son, Jack, as they were panning for gold

about five miles from Yacolt, according to the Clark County sheriff's

While the sheriff's office said it didn't think the bones belonged to

rihe famed hijacker, speculation had run high that the skull was Coo

per's because it was found in the general area where Cooper bailed out

lof a plane with $200,000.

Cooper hijacked the plane in Seattle in November, 1971, after pick-

ing up $200,000 and

somewhere

over Southwestern

Washington.

• No trace of Cooper had been found until a 8-year-old boy found some .

supposition as well as fact. Sometimes it's hard to tell the

fantasy. Take .44, the semifiction book about the Son of

Sam murders in New York by Jimmy Breslin and Dick

Schaap. Breslin and Schaap admit in the foreword to the

book that they changed the names of the characters and

the sequence of events, and embellished on the story.

They graphically detailed what their deranged killer

was thinking about, for example, but it was obviously

what the authors thought the killer was thinking. Of

course, it added greatly to the drama of the book.

Breslin and Schaap said the embellishment was

legitimate because they wanted to recreate the at-

mosphere of the murders, to portray in fiction, the gut-

PORTLAND - For more thang

eight years, Ralph Himmelsbach, '

quest of a legendary hijacker

called D.B. Cooper. But the first

real break in the case didn't come

was drawing to a close.

After 29 years with the bureau,

Himmelsbach retired as

Himmelsbach was the agent re-

leaped from a Worthwest Airlines

727 with 10,000 $20 bills and two

parachutes on Thanksgiving Eve,,

December 31, 1979

Dear

First, let me assure you: I am D,B. Cooper, the individual who

completed the skyjacking in 1969. Of course, you - and any of

your colleagues - may choose to disbelieve this: our society is

comprised of individuals who, strangely enough, believe in that

which is untrue, disbelieve in that which is tact.

Nevertheless, I have decided that it is time for a bit of communica-

tion. Somewhat rather smugly observing the minor fanfare my ten-

year

anniversary caused in the media this November, I suddenly

realized that I wanted people to know I was still alive -- and

that I had, in fact, successfully eluded the police and lived -.:

very nicely.. I might add - on the proceeds of my adventure.

I moved to Atlanta more than five years ago and began watching

your newscasts. You seemed to have a "no-nonsense" approach to .

the news which

I can appreciate - and thus, when I finally decided

to communicate w/ the outside world, you appeared the natural choice.

I'd like to clear up two items concerning my little event. First,

I did it for the sheer sake of adventure, nothing more. And this

adventure was both a mental & physical challange - which leads

me to my second item: how I eluded the police. While I shall not

detail the incident -- at least not now - I will say that it was

a simple case of using simplicity when everyone else concentrated

on complexity. If the police ever do discover how I did it, they

will feel a bit foolish. And I even left a bit of a clue, which

still remains in the area: I was back there this past summer.

you have a wonderful city and I have enjoyed my

stay. I own

a house in the city and am delighted with the many

cultural opportunities here. Indeed, I hope to remain in Atlanta

for at least a few more years.

Again, whether or not you believe this is

"the real thing" does

not concern me. I am very much aware that it is & simply wished

a bit of communication with the outside world, I might call you

scation with na.

sometime in the future ... and if so, I have enclosed an index

card with something typed on it: when

I call, I will identify

myselt by what has been typed. In addition, you can be assured

of only one "authentic" D.B. Cooper.

I wish you

a Happy New Year and thank you for this opportunity to

communicate after 10 years...

D.B. Cooper

based this belief on three facts. The first

would indicate a rolling motion and would indicate the flow

of the river.

The second fact was that the money was found

in the surface layer of the upper reworked beach sand.

The

third fact was that the distribution of the money was in

this surface layer only, and none was tound to be in the

post dredging sand. When reminded of the fact that the

rubber bands holding the money together were still in place,

but extremely brittle and crumbled upon touch,

Material dredged from

The dredge material deposited at the site where

The material deposited

HOW HE FOILED FBI

Last November24th, a man identifying himself as

%. Cooper'

parachutedtrom a Northwest Orient

Jines. 727 jetliner between Seattle and Reno Nevada

with a parcel containing 10,000 twenty dollar bills which

was the ransom money that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattle-

Tacoma international airport.

The F.B.I. and other state and local law enforcement

agents assisted by companies of Gol's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payers dollars looking for cooper.

So far Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same ingenious manner that he pulled off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

it was a calculated risk that's why he jumped in bad

weather and at night, also he waited a little longer than

usual before pulling his ripcord.

Adding that his free

fall was about 5,000 of the total 7,000 feet. Which was very

risky doing at night.

He came down about a hundred miles away from S.W.

Washington contrary to the F.B.I. report that he touched

down near Vancouver Washington.

The first thing he did on landing was bury his chute,.

he was within five miles of where he had intended in an

. evergreen wooded terrain. He credited this accuracy

to his projected calculations and his japanese watch.

He wouldn't say whether he had an accomplice on the.

ground. He said he had lived in Seattle and had once•

danger.

two parachutes he, had ordered. A stewardess came

back with the money in a canvas bag to where cuper

was holding another stewardess as hostage in the rear

of the passenger cabin.

Cooper checked out the loot, first thing and noticed

that they reeked of duplicating flud, Then the stewardess

made two more trips out on to the run way to bring in

chutes.

the chutene of the fuel trucks pulled up.. then he ord-

ered the passengers off the plane, and everyone else into

the cockpit...a middle-aged, executive looking man

started to push his way back through the line into the

tourist cabin. Cooper tensed up expecting the guy to try

something heroic - but he had just left his briefcase

on his seat and was retrieving it.

The F.B.I. headquaters" in Seattle has vowed to ser-

utinize every foot of land between the Sea-Tac airport

and Reno to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias "

Fink on your Friends" programe the public has generally

granted Cooper adoration and somewhat a hero status.

clear of the plane. Buzzing the cockpit he asked the

captain what the hold-up was.. Trouble with the vapor lock

was the answer. And another truck was coming. Cooper

told the Captain: "Not more than one fuel truck at a

time" but eventually. live fuel trucks cane out, only

three of which were able to deliver. Cooper almost blew

his cool, he went forward to the cockpit and told the

captain it was take. off. time, and to take the plane to

Mexico..

The plane was again airborn at 7:40 pm four hours

and fourty two minutes after leaving Portland.

The parachutes were unacceptable so he decided to

jump without a reserve chute.. he cut the extra chute

up and used the strips to tie the money to his waist.

Next he took the stewardess forward and ordered the

captain to lock the door from the inside. Then he returned

aft, closing the tirst class and tourist compartments

behind him.

Then he got on the intercom and told the captain to

hold the aircraft at 7,000 feet, and speed at 200 miles

per hour.

Last he ordered that nobody, under any circumstances,

was to attemtp to make any further contact with him.

Shortly after he jumped,

Cooper declared to the reporter that he was going to

retire the night of the interview and head to an undis-

closed destination. He said he would be back in Five years,

thanks to "The Statue of Limitations!"

The following purports to be a copy of one of

the twenty dollar bills taken by skyjacker "D.B. Cooper"

when he jumped from a 727 on 24 November 1971.

I wonder whether the serial numbers correspond

to any of the stolen currency.
