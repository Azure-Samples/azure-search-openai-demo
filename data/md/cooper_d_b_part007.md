11-YEAR-OLD LEGEND OF SKYJACKER D.B. COOPER, PLANS TO SEARCH THE

COLUMBIA RIVER WHERE HE BELIEVES THE STILL-MISSING COUPER LEFT SOME DF -

HIS $200. 000 RANSOM.

RICHARD TOSAN ALSU HAS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH FOUR BROTHERS

WHO DUN FARM LAND WEST OF PORTLAND TO SEARCH AN AREA IN WHICH PART DE

THE $200,000 RANSOM PAID BY NORTHWEST AIRLINES ON THANKSEIVING EVE 1971

AN 8-YEAR-DLD BDY PICNICKING WITH HIS FAMILY ON A BEACH ON THE

FAZIO BROS. PROPERTY FOUND ROTTING PACKETS CONTAINING $5,800 IN $20

BILLES THE ONLY MONEY RECOVERED FROM THE SKYJACKING.

TOSAWI A CERESS CALIF.9 PRURATE ATTORNEY WRITING A BOOK ON THE

SKYJACKINGI WANTS TO START SEARCHING NOV. 24 - THE 11TH ANNIVERSARY OF

THE DAY A MAN USING THE NAME COOPER BAILED DUT OF A NORTHWEST BOEING 727

WITH THE MONEY APPARENTLY STRAPPED AROUND HIS BODY IN ONE OF THE SPARE

PARACHUTES HE DEMANDED..

COOPER HIJACKED THE PLANE AFTER IT LEFT PORTLAND, LET THE

FASSENGERS OFF IN SEATTLE AND ORDERED THE CREW TO STAY IN THE COCKPIT

AREA AND FLY HIM TO REND, NEV., WITH THE RANSOM MONEY HE GOT FROM THE

AIRLINE.

HE PAPACHUTED FROM THE PLANE'S REAR DOOR. THE FBI COMPÚTED HE

LANDED IN THE LAKE MERWIN AREA NORTHEAST OF VANCOUVER, WASH.

TOSAW, WHD LEFT

THE CASE ARE THE MORE TO AN EATE SEE LA SEE NEEDS IN

SOME NINE MILES WEST OF VANCOUVER.

HE WANTS SOMEGNE TÜ DRAG THE RIVER WITH GRAPPLING HOOKS TO TRY TO

SNAG COOPER'S PARACHUTE, HIS EDDY OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT DIVERS COULD

THEN CHECK.

"MY THEORY IS THAT THE PARACHUTE WOULD BE EASIEST TO FIND BECAUSE

IT'S 28 FEET ACROSS AND WITH NYLON CORDS AND A CANVAS HARNESS,"

HE FIGURES THE MONEY FOUND HAS CHURNED UP EY AN ARMY CORPS DF..

ENGINEERS' DREDGE WORKING THE AREA IN EARLY 1980.

TOSAN HAS WITHDRAWN A REWARD HE HAD OFFERED FOR FINDING ANY SIGN OF

COOPER.

HE BELIEVES THE HIJACKER WAS AN EX-MILITARY MAN WITH PARAcHUTE

TRAINING: AND POSSIBLY A STRONG SWIMMER WHO COULD HAVE MADE IT TO SHORE

AFTER DUMPING THE CHUTE AND THE HEAVY MONEY BAG IN THE WATER.
