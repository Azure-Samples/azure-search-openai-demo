ad in newspapers around

Oregon and Washington,

asking Cooper to contact

him.

Later, shile Fleming and

millionaire Max Palevsky

were organizing LA, an in-

termediary offered io put

the newsman in contact

with Cooper-for $30,000.

Palevsky put up the money

and Fleming flew up to

meet Cooper, dragging

along two tape recorders, a

motion picture camera,

two cameramen and $30,-

000 in cash.

The headline on the

third and final instaliment

• read: "Is D. B. Cooper the

real D. B. Cooper?" There

is considerable reason for

doubt, since the men who

police say talked to Flem-

ing — and who allegedly

took his $30,000 - have

been arrested by the FBI

on charges of defrauding

Fleming of his money.

Arrested Before Story

The arrest took place on

May 2, long before Flem-

ing wrote his story for LA.

Why did Fleming pub-

lish the story in a manner

that led some readers, un-

aware of the fraud arrest,

to believe that the early

installments were the real

thing?

Fleming doesn't feel that

the initial installment was

deceptive, noting

that

"there were disclainers in

it," referring to two lines

near

the end: "The fore-

going narrative was relat-

ed to me by the man I be-

lived to be Cooper

..

and,

"Doubts about wheth-

er I had the right man

would arise later..

"y wanted the reader to

experience it just exactly

as I aid," Fleming says.

"It's an adventure story,

as much about me as

about D. B. Cooper, and I

wanted to put the reader

in my shoes. If the reader

was reasonably alert,

would have seen in

the

press that these guys had

been busted by the FBI."

If the man Fleming in-

terviewed

was not D. B

Cooper

— and Fleming.

isn't totally sure he was

not the hijacker-then he

was a masterful con man,

to hear Fleming tell it.

trouble rounding them up.

With their trial sched-

uled to begin Nov. 27,

Fleming says he still finds

it "difficult to accept" the

possibility that

he was

duped.

"I asked that guy

questions

no

con

man

could have prepared for,"

he says.

"I went over him

like a vacuum cleaner."

Fleming

notes that

"Cooper"

went into detail

on matters of air naviga-

lion and perachute prose-

dure-una vare that Fiem-

ing is a licensed privaie pi-

lot with some 700 hours in

the air.

Because

of the magni-

tude of the story and be-

cause of its intended role

as the kickoff piece for his

new newspaper, Fleming

says,

he

was extremelv

careful in his questioning.

"At the

risk of sounding

immodes:," he adas,

wouldn't want to do

any-

thing to

damage my own

very good reputation as a

reporter."

He

has

an ingenious,

mirror - within - a - mirror

theory of his own.

"I'm not saying that the

FBI

was wrong,

and

would never suggest that

they

would

deliberately

distort the facts-though

if I, one lonely reporter,

could get the story when

8,000 F'BI agents couldn't,

then that's not the kind of

publicity

that

J.

Edgar

Hoover, then alive, would

want for the FB!"

Noting

that

"Cooper"

was aware the information

would be published and

get to the police, Fleming

says, "It Is very, very diffi-

cult

for me to accent the

fact that a mind brilliant

enough to concoct a story

as sophisticated as the one

this guy toid me, would be

stupid

enough

to turn

sibility that he was both

enough to pull off

the hijacking:

story and spread enough

false clues in the story so

it wouid not look right and

the FBI would say he isn

the hijacker. So, it he does

do any time, it's for fraud,

ict

-= hijarking

And

when

he coy.es

rat, the

$200,000 is stiltthere."

In that case, of course,

Fleming's serics would be

jacking, as readers of Part

One might have thought,

not the account of how a

duped,

as

Part Three

indicates,

or

perhaps it would he both.

In any evert, Fleming

has no regrets

about the

adventure.

"I've

always

been a reporter wno takes

risks. You

don't get the

plums at the

top of the

tree unless you jump

high."

Fleming may have some

lingering doubts about the

man he interviewed, but
