as follows:

given the following set of circumstances,

the Boeing 727 which you are generally familiar with, the

cear stairway flying at 10,000 feet through clouds at about

178 knotsoon IFR Flight, what would be the conditions that

would exist as soon as the cabin was depressurized?

b6

b7C

A. As soon as the hatch was cracked, there would

be depression matters of the aircraft. The lowering of the

stairwell would create a

effect on the entire aircraft

because the air flow is disrupted here which would naturally

effect the aircraft.

l. This would have no material effect on the jumper

physiologically at this altitude?

A. No, not at 10,000 feet.

I. This would be a very practical altitude in

which to jump?

A. Certainly.

2. Would this be an ideal type aircraft erom

which to make a daylight or night jump?

A.

Yes.

Given the consitions at night time with

clouds below to about 1,000 feet and partial clouds

and intermittent clouds taken to a ceiling about 4,000

feet, would this present any problems to a jumper?

A. There again we're dealing with variables.

If a man knew what altitude at the time he was leaving

on penisatt, there are two ways to determine his altitude

1. From the second hand on a wristwatch;

2. A wrist type altimeter.

l. Making this jump, what would be practical

for the man to do?

To open the chute immediately or to

wait until he had a view of the ground?

I would wait at least ten seconds before

pulling.

This way I am not only clear of the aircraft,

but I am also out of visual sight of the aircraft or any

, aircraft in the area. Cloud covering is an advantage but

not knowing where the ground is, is a problem because of the

peaks in the area.

The above procedure would be in effect

, I was not in familiar territory. Another advantage of

an early chute opening would be for the jumper to select

the best drop zone possible.

In unfamiliar territory and wherein a light might

be observed, would' give the jumper not only an idea of his

altitude but an opportunity for steering himself toward

a suitable arop zone.

In chuting in familiar territory, this type of

dropp would be rather

• "simple to an experienced jumper".

This would allow the jumper to "free-fall" for the full

SE 164-81

40 second delay time. This would put him at approximately

2,000 feet altitute when the chute opens which still gives

him another three minutes to the ground.

Footwear for an experienced jumper is inconsequential.

Jumping into a heavily wooded area is also

relatively simple.

Jumping into water is even more simple for an

experienced jumper.

Q. If the wind velocity at 10,000 feet was 25

knots and the ground level five knots, roughly how far

could he travel?

He would be in the saddle for ten minutes.

on a clear and pull situation (immediate opening of the

chute,, he coula go five miles on the wind line or winc

arrection; and a norma delayed opening maximum distance

with a five knot wind would be two or three thousand feet.

Even with a non-steerable chute, by taking hold of the

risers and facing into the wind and making an almost direct

descent which would also produce a very soft landing

equivalent to stepping off a chair.

l. Would the spped of the plane at 178 knots

present any problem?

A. No, not for a jumper.

A. None whatsoever.

I. Do you think this man made this type of jump

before.

• In a free-fall from 10,000 feet to approximatel

,000 feet, what would be his rate of speed at rip cor

pull?

A. 120 miles per hour which is normal free-fall

terminal speed within the atmosphere because the speed

increases upon the increase of altitude.

eering an at you the do alley of a grapes

A. No more than if he had jump boots on. It

shouldn't create any problem.

From the information furnished regarding the above

situation, it is my opinion that this jumper was experienced

and I would say having at least 150 jumps.

l. What would your guess be as to the number

of jumpers in the country that could pull this type of

jump off?

A. At least 1000 people.

In the "Parachutist" put out by the U. S. Parachute

Association, there are listed the names and state from which

they are from for every individual which has obtained a

license, whether it is Class A, B, C, D, or I.

A Class C junper coula nave made the above juno.

There are currently 7192 licensed Class C jumpers-to say

nothing of Class D'or I.

As of this month, there are 3094 Class D jumpers.

Class I is not given.

The above figures do not include military personnel

that have done high altitude free-fall jumps.

The only time lapse necessary from departure of the

would accepting an unfamiliar chute present

any problem to this person?

A. It wouldn't bother me. I would certainl

heck it over as would any experienced jumper

Q. This would take less than ten minutes?

A. Yes.

Could an average Forest Service Smoke Jumper

pull off this job?

A. I doubt it.

Bearing in mind smoke jumpers are

gor the most pyrt do at son like luang on smilitary,

In all likelihood, the smoke' jumper could be

eliminated.

I. L.

would you discuss the age factor of a man

45 to 50 in parachute jumping? How many are active?

A. Very few.

However, high altitude jumpers in that age

group would be extremely limited.

These would be officials

of jump clubs or parachute governing bodies and/or instructors.

I. Bringing the age factor into this, would that

change your estimate of the excess with which this jump

could be performed?

b7C

l. Could you estimate how many residents in

the State of washington or Oregon could have pulled this

off?

A. No.

DAVIS would have this much money and whether he has been

AFTER talking to

Seattle Times, I called and

advised that DAVIS formerly worked for them as a mail clerk and a t

multilith machine operator, but when they found that he was

using their mailing machine for his own use and thereby defrauding

the company, he was fired. His current address is P.O. BOX

653, McMinnville, Oregon.

described DAVIS as some kind of a nut,

who was selling some health-type apparatus, pretends to be a

lecturer on hypnosis and allegedly had developed a cure for

heart diseases. He is a former professional football player

and at one time owned a small paper.

Neither
