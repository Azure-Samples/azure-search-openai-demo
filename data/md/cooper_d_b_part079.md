There is a little latch near the tail of

many airliners with rear stairways.

During flight, the wind flips the latch

up so no one can lower the stairs. In

the industry the latch is called "the

Cooper Vane." But it has been nearly

15 years since airlines began install-

This time, Richard Tosaw says, he is

going to find D.B, Cooper.

"I know

where he is," Tosaw said. "I don't

know who he is, but he's from the

Seattle area, and maybe we'll get

lucky and there'll be a wallet with

soine piece of identification."

briefly, its passengers for ransom.

the crew, ordered the pilot to take

off for Mexico City, but quickly low-

beach where nearly $6,000 of the

ransom was found six years ago.

And how did the $6,000 get there?

As Tosaw explains it, when Cooper

released two of the three flight at

tendants in Seattle before the final

take-off, he pulled some bitls from

the bag and offered them a "tip."

They refused.

"I belteve he stuffed those bills in-

side his coat or clothing, maybe un-

der his belt. That's the $6,000 that

came up (Actually $5,800; 10 bills

were missing from one packet). The

rest is in the bag. It the bag had

Tosaw obtained the piece of evi-

dence key to his theory long after

the bills were found

"The money was still in packets,

with the rubber bands around them,

though the bands broke as soon as

they were touched," he said. "That

'showed it couldn't have come far.

And it couldn't have been there

long."

Early reports said the packets were

scattered near each other and cov-

ered with sand.

But while talking with the mother of

"The packets were still in a clump,

pressed together, not scattered, not

really covered. They hadn't come

far enough even to separate," he

said. "That makes the eddy just

area."

On Nov. 23, eve of the hijacking

anniversary, Tosaw will put a team

of divers into the river.

On Nov. 29, the Saturday after

Thanksgiving, as is traditional, the it

annual D.B. Cooper Party will be

wrote a play about that.

"One of the great acts of imagination

of our time," Orlock said of Cooper's

feat.

"A stupid, desperate rascal who en-

dangered many lives," said retired

FBI agent Ralph Himmelsbach, who

spent eight years on the case.

Tosaw came in late. He read a news-

paper account on the tenth anniver-

sary of the jump and it intrigued

him.

"I couldn't believe that in 20th Cen-

tury America a man could jump out

of a plane and disappear. I'd just

bers of the bills Cooper got and of-

fered a reward for one of them.

They were from a Seattle bank's

ransom fund (since discontinued)

• and had been microfilmed.

"I suppose I've spent, conservatively,

$100,000 on the Cooper search," To-

saw said. "I spent at least six months

up there, not all at once but on many

trips. There was the book. I hired

two secretaries... No, I can't make

any money on this. But I'd like to

finish the job."

It's fun, he said, not an obsession. "It

would be if I were depriving anyone,

but I have no family." And he is

stimulated by the keen interest of

others. "If the boy hadn't found that

money, I'd be prepared to believe

almost any story.". Tosaw said. "But

Last year Tosaw had two divers

search the eddy just above the

beach. This time, he said he will

have 10 divers, cover a great deal',

more area, and bring Cooper up

"People don't want me to find him.

They don't want to hear that D.B.

Dear

Attached is correspondence indicating a solution to the.

D.B. Cooper case, giving details for the location and ap-

prehension of the culprits involved, and the procedures

to obtain our $200,000.00.

Judging from this

letter you can see that our president

is plagued with all kinds of cranks. Yet we will keep

accepting any information regarding this particular case

in the hope that sometime a piece of information will be

received that is factual and could aid in the solving of

this case.

As indicated, I do not believe there is any valid information

in the letter, but nonetheless we will pass it on to your

department so that you may further investigate it.

NO

stone should be left unturned in an attempt to solve this

At your convenience, please advise us what your evaluation

of this letter is.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and may you have

a successful New Year.

Yours very truly,

ear Sir;

Whether you believe the following infornation, and how I came to obtain it is a

atter for you to decide. By rejecting the information, you are still minus $250,000 and a

aniac that has motivated hijacking and mass murdering aboard Airlines.

I an in no way affiliated with EVIL, or the hijacker "D.B. Copper." I am a man of

od, and when the times comes, you will know just how close I am untingsticans walking with

bd. For the time being, we will let it stand, and get to the point.

"D.B. Cooper" ordered the aircraft to circle SEA-TAC airport, as you well know.

bu also know, although it is not general public information, that a tape recorder had been

ound that had been issuing orders to the pilot long after "Cooper" jumped. What you do not know

but God knows) is WHBRE he jumped, and the disposition of the money. His letter to you sometime

so was a payaholgist psychological blunder, pointing out the fact that he lost the money bag

Eter jumping from the aircraft, due to the force of the wind ripping it out of his hand. Before

reveal the locality of the ransom money, (and I can pinpoint the spot where you can recover

1) let me fill you in as to "Cooper's" MaxaX plan of operation. In the first place,

he had

1 accomplice, whom I will reveal a little later. "Cooperl as you have suspected, is a

amper" for the National Forest Service, The very name "D.B. Cooperl means, Double Back (to)

ooper (Lake)!")

When the aircraft circled around above Sea-Tac Airport, "Cooper" bailed out,

aving the recorder running with directions, etc. He planned the jump so that the wind was

oming from the Southwest at a certain tate of speed, and would blow him toward the North-nortige

ast! His plan was to land in Cooper Lake, not far from Salmon La Sac, a public camping area.

miscalculated the wind and drift, and landed instead in LAKE KACHESS!

I have shared this information with the F.B.I. and also the Secret Service, Both

ave stupidly ignored me, although it is the duty of the same to check all possible angles, woulr

"t you think? The Secret SErvice is so secret, I wonder if they know what is real? But that is

eside-the point. It is just exasperation upon my part, so forgive me my ravings, will you?

Now to the meat of the subject, as I told the above "security" organizations:

know the exact whereabouts of "D.B. Cooper"

and his accomplice, and also the EXACT SPOT that

olds the money hidden from the human eye. I will go a little further and say that Cooper, who

s about 35 years of age, and slighty, or a little more so, kita bald, is enjoying the holidays

i his leisure with his accomplice, a very atbractive ted-headed woman of about the same age

nat has a miniature sized dog as a pet. (A check of the passenger list at the time of the hi.

ck, and the memory of one of the stewardesses will reveal this to you.) First things first!

You will find the two depraved and mad outlaws about four and one half miles in

a a dirt road on the east side of ltte Kachess, which is, by the way, a dead end road. When you

ave captured them, and as God, even Jehovah the Father, is my witness, you WIlL capture them,

nd the maximum penalty of DEATH is too good for them, you will then contact me at the above

idress, and I will lead you to the ransom money. I have tried several times to recover it, but

now know why I have been unable to. "Cooper" left the very unstable plastic explosives in the

ag with the money, and only a qualified disposal man should handle it. when the bag is recover-

1. The bag is slightly torn and a few bills are missing, but "Ya can't win 'em all!"

I am mailing a copy of this letter to a friend of mine,

se Sattle Post*Intelligencer, knowing that he is an honest man, and that he will not foolishly

eveal this information for the same reason you won't. Skepticism, until proof positive has been

eceived. You have your information, and the rest is between you and God (if you believe God),

• between you and the Devil, (becaage he would have you disbelieve so that the murder and aboni

tions that are continuing to happen because of the desperado fame of this man has gone unchecke

and when then events

ave taken place, he is to have soul rights to the information and "Scoop." this is the will of

" Heavenly Father. It is also Jehovah's will that I receive the reward for Cooper, and also for

ne ranson money, the total of which, as I believe, is $50, 000. Along with that, out of the

indness of your heart, you will present me, as a messenger of God, with two honorary lifetime

lakets to all parts of the world on your airlines, and honoured by other airlines. This is not

ery much to ask, for I will not use them for my own pleasure, but to spread the good news of

ir Lord Jesus Christ, and the name of our Father, JEHOVAH.

God Bless you and good hunting;

Dear

This letter is in regards to the parachuting skyjacking on

November 24, 1971 of a Northwest Airlines plane between Seattle,

Washington and Reno, Nevada. This case has, so far, not been

solved and

the skyjacker who collected $200,000 is known only as

D.B. Cooper.

In a telephone conversation on November 8, 1973 with

Jat Northwest Airlines, St. Paul, Minnesota, we discussed

rewards offered in this case.

He told me of rewards having been

offered of 10% of recovered amounts, or possibly $25,000 if all

is recovered.

also told me of a Seattle newspaper

offering $5000.

Dear Sirs:

This letter concerns the skyjacking of Flight 305 on Thanksgiving

Eve, 1971, by so-called D.B. Cooper. I would seriously like to

offer a theory and some basic facts as to who this individual is.

Of course, I fully realize that the checking of any story requires

time and resources, and that I could be completely wrong in my

assumption.

Nevertheless, should you decide to use my idea, and

should it prove worthwhile, is there a reward still in force in

this case? Thank you for your time.

I await your reply.

sincerely toura
