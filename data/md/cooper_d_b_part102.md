The following investigation was conducted by SA

AT LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS

on 7/2/74, HOWARD J. HUBBELL, Inmate, U.S, Penitentiary,

Leavenworth, Kansas

$84333-132, stated

that he is more and

more convinced that his crine partner is the man who per

petrated this skyjacking.

He stated that his crime partner,

always used the alias D. B. CODPER or!

and that at one time, he suggested that they hijack

an airplane.

The plan was that he would go into the aircraft

and hijack it, telling the authorities to deliver money to

HUBBELL who would be on the ground.

When the money was given

to HUBBELL, HUBBELL would tell him and the airplane would be

released.

HUBBELL stated that he told his crime partner

On January 7, 1972, witness CORD SPRECKEL, 624

taken in 1957 and the other photograph displays CONRAD as

unshaven, he could not positively eliminate CLIFFORD as a

suspect in captioned hijcking.

SPRECKEL said that there

are sone facial characteristics in the photograph of

CLIFFORD taken 6/6/71, which are similar to those of the

hijacker, although SPRECKEL felt that this similarity was

not great. SPRECKEL stated that if he were furnished a

clean shaven, he may be able to eliminate CLIFFORD as a

suspect.
