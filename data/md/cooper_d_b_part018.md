Portland will check the applications of those

individuals residing in the Portland azde through the current

If additional investigation of the applicants is

believed warranted, Seattle will advise Portland.

After reading about the skyjacking and seeing a sketch of

suspicions are based on the following:

He resembles the sketch.

He knows a lot about planes.

He has done a lot of sky diving.

He would have the nerve to do it.

He has served time at Monroe.

He has lots of connections everywhere.

Re Skyjacker:

After reading several articles on this in the paper.

I feel that the FBI have spent a lot of time tracking down

suspects from skydiving and parachute clubs. I would like

'to suggest an alternative source of suspects. This being

from P.O.W. airmen who have parachuted from aircraft, particul-

arly World War II. Apparently the man is around 45-50, perhabs

too old for sky-diving but the right age for Warld War II.

Also once a person has jumped there is no fear of a second

jump. I know this from personal experience. Further, I

would suggest perhaps this

man may have attempted one or more

escapes from a P.O.W. camp. Obviously he has nerve and it

would be unlikely that he would sit in a P.O.w. camp without

attempting escape. It might be worth the effort to contact

ex-P.O.W. oxganizations in Seattle, Vancouver, B.C., Portland

and others.

There is one man who when I last heard from him he lived

in Sumnex, Wash, and worked for Rohr Aircraft several years ago

He fits all the above requirements

that I suggested: Ex-P.O.W., World War II, bailed out, tried to

escape at least twice. Age 49 or 50, height 5-10" or 5-11"

about 170 lbs. I can't honestly say that he resembles the

photograph (composite) in the paper as he had a crew cut when

I saw him about five years ago. Before enlisting in world

War II he lived in Las Vegas, Nevada,

As mentioned previously, he may or may not resemble

the composite photo. I have no information to suspect this man

other than the above. This is strictly a long shot but I do

feel that my approach is worth considering.

Northwest Airlines,

Washington, U.S.A.

Attention: Airport Terrainal Manager

Dear Sir:

I am attaching a clipping from TIME magazine (Dec, 6/71)

desertbing Flight 305 which was noteworthy in every sense, but

additionally one iten aroused my curlosity and fox this reason:

I am interested in making contact with

who was a

passenger and is quoted as stated in the attached report.

He could very

well be a resident of either Tacoma or Seattle or elsewhere for that

matter.

The reason for my unusual interest 1s that I could very

well be a cousin of this man.

soved from Prince Edward Island, Canada, to the Tacoma-Seattle axea a long

tine ago and raised a family, If I renember correctly, he had a son J0hn

Who would be an older man now if still alive. My thought was that this

could be a grandson of the original man. My family

lost contact with these people through the years and have never net

them-that is, the younger generations.

Would it be possible from your files or otherwise to make

contact with this

and deterine if he perchance 1s a

mexaber of the family I have described

and pass this letter along to him.

I would be pleased to hear fron this man if indeed he is

by coincidence a member of the

fanily I have described.

In any event, may I express my thanks for any anticipated

trouble this may cause, for I fully realize 1t 1s a nost unusual request.

Yours very truly,

...

CRIME :. "

The Bandit Who Went

Out into the Cold

Northwest Airlines Flight 305 began

as the most prosaic of milk runs. It start.

ed in Washington, D.C.. at 8:30 2.m.

last Wednesday, with scheduled stops

al Minneapolis, Great Falls and Mis-

soula, Mont., Portland, Spokane and

finally Seattle. What happened en route

rivaled Alfred Hitchcock's more baroque

fantasies. In the most elaborate sky.

jacking ploy in the bizarre history of

air piracy, an inconspicuous middic-iged

traveler identified on the manifest as

"D.B. Cooper" extorted $200,000 from

the airline, and apparently foiled any

plan of capture by parachuting to safe-

ty over southwest Washington State.

Whoever the latest air pirate is, he ab-

viously had conceived his plan with a

lapidary's attention to detail. Wearing

dark glasses and a plain business suit,

he boarded the Boeing 727 in Portland

and took a seat at the rear. He did noth-

ing to distinguish himself from the other

36 passengers aboard-until he gave a

stewardess a note stating his demands.

"I thought he was trying to hustle me,

said the stewardess, Florence Schalfner.

"I stufled the note in my purse, and he

motioned that I should take it out and

read it," He wanted, upon arrival at Sa

aitle-Tacoma International Airport; the l

sum of $200,000 and four parachules.

Recalls Passenger Richard Simmons: Y

saw one stewardess answer a call, and

her face dropped. She looked bewildered

and

gulped. I guess she learned what

was happening then."

She

certainly

did.

The hijacker

showed her a briefcase that contained

two red cylinders and a tangle of

wire. He told her calmly that unless

his demands were met he intended to

INSPECTING RAMP ON FLIGHT 305

blow up the airplane. She immediately

relayed the demands to Captain Wil-

liam W. Scott, who in turn radioed Se-

attle ground control. Northwest Pros-

ident Donald W. Nyrop quickly issued

orders to cooperate fully with the hi-

jacker and "do whatever he demands."

Airline officials were dispatched to round

up the money, and a call went out for

the four parachutes.

The 727 circled the Seattle airport

until the hijacker was satisfied that the

money and parachutes were ready. The

plane then touched down at 5:40 p.m.

Said Pilot Scolt to the men in the con-

trol tower: "We will ask you to stay

there until we get coordinated with our

friend in the back."

Getting Antsy, Says Passenger Bar-

bara Simmons:

"It was really strange.

When the plane landed,

for 15 minutes, and nobody talked."

as soon as the money and parachutes

were brought aboard,

the hijacker al

lowed the passengers and two of the

stewardesses to disembark; however, he

demanded that one of the girls,

Mucklow, remain on board as a hos-

lage. The hijacker asked to be flown to

Mexico. The crew explained that such

a ilight was out of their ship's range.

At one point the impatient captain told

the tower:

"This guy is getting antsy."

To underscore the point, the hijacker in-

terrupted an attempt by a Federal Avi-

ation Administration official so board

the plane by snapping: "Let's get this

show on the road!"

With the hijacker's agreement, the

plant ultimately look off for Reno, as-

tensibly a refueling stop en route to Mex-

ico. Yet it is clear that the hijacker

knew precisely what he was about. He,

ordered the plane to be flown at loss

than 10,000 fe. and at 200 m.p.b., an ex-

tremely slow cruising speed. He also or-

dered the rear door to be left unlocked.

Of all U.S. commercial airliners, only

the 727 has a door beneath the tail

that would permit a reasonably safe

parachute jump. Then he locked Miss

Mucklow in the forward cabin with the

crew, and was not seen again. Five

planes trailed the jet from Seattle, but

no one saw the hijacker jump. If he

fell frec in the dark for more than a

few hundred feet, however, he would

have been almost impossible to spot.

Four-State Manhunt. FBI officials es-

limate that he dropped into an open

area in the wilderness some 35 miles

north of Portland. The location was de-

termined by the time of his jump, which

probably occurred when a red light went

on in the cockpit, indicating a drop in

cabin pressure. The hijacker must have

opened the rear door al that point.

A four-state manhunt was immedi-

ately launched, FBl agents, along with

more than 30 oflicers of the Clark and

Cowlitz county sherif's departments, set

up a command post and fanned out

through a thickly timbered corridor 15

mites long and ten miles wide near the

towns of Longview and Ariel in south-

west Washingion. The area is densely

forested enough to present a serious haz-

ard to the jumper if he did not make

the clearing. Said Undersherift Tom Mc-

Dowell: "We're either looking for a para-

chute or a hole in the ground."

The 3rd Armored Cavalry joined the

search from the air, sending out two heli.

copters. But the hijacker also managed

to pick idcally inclement weather to

cover his escape. Sullen clouds rolled

in from the Pacific, grounding the chop-

pers until a couple of hours before dark-

ness. By weck's end officers were scratch-

ing their heads and wondering where

to look next for the dapper, audacious

fellow with $200,000 to spend.

He advised he considered our suggestion re circularization

to law enforcement agencies in the western part of the

country, to see if they had

a missing persons report with

them answering the hijacker's description.

He wanted

to know if we had done it in Washington and Oregon and I

advised him we had not, but we had readily available,

facilities over the teletype system that we could do it.

He advised he was recommending to Mr. HOOVER

we do it in Washington and Oregon first and see what

results were obtained before we spread it further.

Agent in Charge

Longvlew Office of the F.B.I.

Longview, Washington

Dear Sir;

A couple of weeks ago I wrote a letter to the Chief of Police;

Woodland, Washington. I requested some information on the hijack-

ing story that recently brought attention to that area. The news-

papers, here in the bay area have quit writing about the event.

Joe May, Woodland's Chief of Police, told me that they can't

comment on any case which is in the hands of another agency. He

suggested that I write to the F.B.I. office in Longview 1f I was

still interested in the case.

As you can see, I am still interested. I'm hoping I can learn

more about the hijacker case through your office. Are you still

searching for him, or has it been called off?

I read in the San Prancisco Chronicle where some people claimed

to have seen a small plane near

the same night.

Did this have any connection with the hijacker?

Thank you for anything you may be able to send me in connection

with this unusual hijacking event.

There is being sent under saparate cover a copy of

a film taken by the U.S. AlI Force cameraman from a chase

plane adjacent to the Northwest Boeing 727 during the

simulated flight sade on January 6, 1972 to determine the

reactions of the airplane to the dropping of approximately

235 pounds from the rear steps in the same manner which 18

belleved to have been used by the hijacker.

A ravion of the film shows the normal flight,

togather with a depression of the stalruay as the load

descende on the steps.

The Bureau is requested, 11 1t desires, to review

the film and then return it to the seattle Office, It being

the original copy.

A copy has been made of the film for the

U. S. At Force par their roguest, and Northwest Alrlines for

its review.

There are also enclosed in the sane package

sequential black and white still photos showing the depression

of the rear stairway by the addition of the sled and the

raaction of the stairway to the actual departure of the alad,

It being noted that the stairway Imnediately returned to a soar

cloned position when the weight was taken from 1t.

Re: SEARCH

•S. AIR FORCE SR-72 AIRCRAF

The Sacramento Division in a teletype dated

12/3/71 (Ser. 550) advised that Beale AFB, California,

had offered,

free of charge to the Bureau, use of an

SR-71 aircraft to photograph terrain over which

the hijacked airplane had flown on its trip to Reno.

This aircraft was described as an extremely

sophisticated aerial reconnaissance plane which would

photograph a strip 20 miles wide with photographic resolution

of detecting objects on the ground 2 feet square. The

film strip would then be reviewed by trained and qualified

U.S. Air Force personnel.

Due to weather conditions along the route, being

inclement at times, the flight never was made.

On 1/10/72 the writer contacted SAC JOHN WILLIAMS,

Sacramento, and explained the results of the experiment

on 1/6/72.

MI. WILLIAMS was requested to have the Air

Force contacted to see if the flight could be made only

over the State of Washington and perhaps from the Columbia

River to a point some 30 miles north. He was also asked

if the Air Force could advise what we could expect of such

an over flight in the way of information which would be

helpful in the search of this terrain.

In response to the above call, SA

who has been handling the hijacking case at Sacramento,

advised he had contacted Beale AFB and made the reguest

for the over flight and that he would attempt to determine

if it could be made, noting that weather conditions still

are effective.

164-81-1853

Copies of the revised map of the area to be searchec

were forwarded the night of 1/10/72 to Sacramentato.

..-3

The attacked plot indicates the envelope of possible landing points of the high jacker (HJ).

It is basedion the following:

- Aircrait position from USAF radar data from McChord AFB furnished by

- Probable jump time (0411 GMT) from an analysis of the recorded communication

from the flight relative to the cabin pressure fluctuation. Flight tests conducted

on January 6 confirmed that the pressure fluctuation almost certainly occurred at

the time the HJ left the airplane.

- Wind information from 10,000' MSL to the ground as determined byl

- Human body traiectories from data furnished by The Boeing Company (free-fall)

who is an expert para-

chutist.

- Time correlation from the above USAF radar information and from the NWA

communications network tape recording.

- Airplane airspeed and altitude from the airplane's flight recorder.

The plot is explained as follows:

1. The heavy dashed line C-D-E-S defines the airplane's probable ground track.

2. Line G-I-J-K defines the westernmost, and Line L-M-N-O the easternmost

probable airplane ground tracks based on the stated position tolerance of 1,5

nautical mile of the USAF radar plot.

3. Lines A-B, h-P, and O-R are the average wind vectors between 10,000' MSL and the

ground, and are the lines parallel to which the HJ would drift after the parachute had

opened.

4. Line H-S-T defines the northernmost (earliest) points over which the HJ probably

left the airplane. Line K-F-O defines the southernmost (latest) points over which

the HJ probably left the airplane. The north-south span of possible jump positions

is a product of the radar position tolerance of t.5 mile, and the possible communication

sime determination tolerance of $1 minute.

5. The area within the boundary defined by Points H-P-Q-R-0-K-J-I-H marks the

extreme limits of probable tanding points based on the above tolerances. That is, assuming

the highest probable degree of inaccuracy in aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, etc.,

all probable HJ landing points would lie within the area defined by this line.

6. If it is assumed aircraft position, jump time, wind vector, and other inputs used are all

accurate (without allowance for the above stated tolerances):

a. The HJ's landing point would be at Point A if his 'chute did not open, or if he

opened it so soon that the high speed caused 'chute damage that resulted in the

equivalent of a free-fall to the ground. (The horizontal body trajectory due to

it being at the same speed as the airplane at the moment of exit, has been ignorec

since it would be a maximum of 2600' along the airplane's track if the HJ free-

fell all the way to the ground in the "least drag" (tucked) position.)

D. It the 'chute was opened without damage immediately after the Hu left the airplane,

he would drift with the wind along Line A-B and would land at Point B. The more

expert he was, the longer he would probably free-fall (to limit his drift with the wind).

The lowest probable aititude to which he would free-fall is 2500' MSL. If he free-

Based on the above, the most favorable search areas, listed in their order of priority, would

be as follows:

- At Point A.

- Along Line A-B, favoring the segment between U and B.

- South of Line A-B.

- North of Line A-B.

In addition to the above, the following are pertinent:

- The landing point is more likely to be south of Line A-B, and it is more likely to be

in the northwest portion of area A-B-R-O-K~J-A than in the southeast portion

thereof.

- It is substantially less likely that the landing point is north of Line A-B. If it is,

the most probable point is south of the Lewis River, and in the south west portion

of the area defined by Points A-B-I-J-A.

be cognizant of the fact that once the operation starts they will be

required to remain overnight in their assigned searching areas rather

than retracing areas covered to go to and from a base camp.

A list of recommended items to be secured for logistic support

of this special is being prepared by the writer the majority of

which can be secured from the Army or the Navy at little or no cost

to the Bureau.

Aerial shotsoraphs of the search area as set forth by the

map of

plus terrain maps are presently being secured

in order that the search area may be properly divided for maximum

coverage by searching agents.

It Is also recommêdded that this search be a completely Bureau

operation involving no outside agencies so as to limit the anount of

publicity which is generated.

It is felt that the prime and secondary search areas, while

the search

will either find the hijacker or lead to the conclusion that the area

pindointed by all available technical data has been completely combed

for traces of the subject.

MOBILE TELEPHONE

Information from

Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company, Longview, Washington.

In event a trailer is used as a base of operations for the

search operation a

completely mobile telephone installation could

be made in the trailer on one week of notice to the phone company

(time element could be lowered to possibly three or four days)

with the trailer to be left at the mobile shop, 906 New York Avenue,

Longview for the better part of one day for, the installation.

Mechanically we would need a 12 volt car battery in good

or new operating condition as a source of power.

The mobile unit would have one or more channels depending

upon the area we worked in in order to insure that we could get to

a mobile operator to place our call to any number.

Cost - one channel $32 per month and for each additional

channel $3 per month.

Possibility of having to use 3 or 4 channels

exists in order to insure ability to reach a mobile opergtor at

some location such as Longview, Portland or Hood River,

regon.

advised using the car battery - 12 volt - in good

condition would

give us indefinite service since the drain on

the battery is not great if the phone is not actually in use.

Cost of installation of the unit is $50

Installation of such a unit would not involve us in line

hookups and we could be completely mobile.

Procedure on calls from any location to the mobile unit

would be - dial long distance - ask for mobile operator - give her

number of the mobile unit (each channel used would have a different

mobile number) - she would then select the channel she could reach

and the call would be made.

Security - same

security as on normal telephone line.

On 1/12/72 I called ASAC ROSACK at Sacramento.

I told him we were temporarily stimied in our search of

whether the photo y Jumped

search.

After checking he saidthey were going to do it;

they had the map of the area and the first good day

when the light was right, they would do it. It would not

take long after that that the photos could be studied and

analysed,

the thought it would be only a few days that

we would

have the results.)

We will be advised.

I called the Bureau and talked to HENRY SHUTZ.

I told him that the SAC had wanted him to know the reason

we had not come in with a request in connection with a

terrain search of the suspect drop area, was that we felt it

would be well to have an aerial reconnaissance.

I furnished

him the information set out above. He said that he understood

and that it was no problem insofar as he was concerned.
