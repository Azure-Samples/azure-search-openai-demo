CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT - HIJACKING;

EXTORTION

On November 24, 1971, an unknown man using the

name Dan Cooper, boarded Northwest Airlines Flight $305,

at Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon, en-

route Seattle, Washington.

As the plane was taxiing down the runway,

Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved

for the stewardesses on the right side of the plane and

behind the last row of passenger seats. The unknown

subject, who occupied the center seat in the last row of

three seats, turned and handed her an envelope which she

did not open for a few minutes until he glanced at her

several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said:

"Miss - I have a bomb here

and 1 would like you to sit by me."

At this point Stewardess

toward the rear of the plane and

handed

the note.

then called the

pilot on the intercon.

on the

flight, later advised that according to notes he made

during the incident teen seconds seems

was received on the intercom at 3:59 PM.

Stewardess

then sat next to the hijacker

who opened a black attache case and showed her what he said

was a bomb.

She described the contents of the attache case

as a bundie of red sticks, which she believed was dynamite.

The bundle consisted of six or eight red colored sticks

approximately six to eight inches long with no writing on the

outside.

The hijacker was holding in his hand a wire which

led to the bundle of sticks and indicated that he could

that ha had in tho

detonate the bomb by touching the wire to a contact. Also in

the attache case was a cylindrical shaped battery about eight

inches long.

' At the Seattlc-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac)

in answer to his demands, the hijacker was provided with the

four parachutes and $200,000 in 20 dollar bills in a canvas

bank bag.

When the plane landed at Seattle at 5:45 PM (PST)

he instructed

Stewardess

to go after the money

which she did. He opened the bag; inspected the money and then

16

told them that the passengers as well as the two othex

stewardesses could leave the plane.

They did deplane.

The

remaining crew members were the three male members of the

flight crew as well as Stewardess

then made several trips out of the

b6

plane to obtain the

parachutes which she brought

to the subject. b7c

said she then asked the hijacker what

his instructions were regarding the destination of the flight.

Up to that point he had refused to tell her except to

say that they were not going to Havanna.

She then obtained

a piece of paper and the hijacker gave her the following

instructions:

"Going to Mexico City - or any place in Mexico -

non-stop - gear down - flaps down - don't go over 10,000

feet altitude - all cabin lights out - do not again land

in the States for fuel or anyother reason - no one behind

the first class section."

It is noted that the plane involved was a Boeing

121,, a tri-jet with stairs under the rear of the aircraft

which are lowered for enplaning and deplaning passengers.

Re: UNKNONN SUBJECT, aka Dan Cooper

At first the hijacker wanted the plane to take

off with the stairs down but after he was advised this

would be impossible, heagreed to having the steps raised

with the comment that they could be lowered after they

became airborne.

It was further agreed that the plane could be

Flown to Portland, Oregon, south to Red Bluff, California

and then east to Reno, Nevada, where it would stop for

refueling.

The plane departed Sea-Tac with the three crew

members in the cabin and

in the rear with the

hijacker.

Within minutes after take off at 7:36 PM, the

hijacker had the stewardess show him how to lower the steps

and he then ordered her to go to the first class section

which she did, and she then continued on to the cabin.

At 8:05 PM the captain was in touch with the

hijacker by

the intercom. This was the last

communication

he had with the hijacker.

Just prior to this communication,

the captain had a signal indicating that the stairs had been

lowered.

At 8:12 PM, the captain experienced "oscillation"

in the plane and thought perhaps the hijacker had departed

the plane.

Air Force fighter planes were escorting the craft

but because

the 727 was flying at 170 knots, the fighter jets

were too fast.

Further, the weather was overcast and

visibility extrcmely low.

When the plane arrived at Reno, the hijacker was

b7C

Extensive search of the southwestern part of

Washington State, which was indicated by the 8:12 PM

"oscillation" experienced by the crew, was conducted through

the aid of fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, automobiles

and on foot.

Results to date have been negative.

Aerial searches have been and are heino made

of the flight path to Reno, Nevada, with negative results.

BOB MATHESON called from the Bureau. He had the

following to say:

1. The Director approved publicity of the

article and artist's conception in the parachute magazine

in response to our teletype 12/7/71.

2. He referred to a teletype of 12//71 from

Portland in regard to a person who was

He said it seemed to him

that Portland had set out a lot of unnecessary

investigation since the purpose of the thing was simply

to get a photo of the suspect and have it shown to

witnesses rather than getting all the background.

He wanted to know if we had considered

having a Northwest plane fly Agents over the exact course at

night so that we could look down and see just what the

situation was when the

"bump" occurred at 8:10 or 8:12 PM.

I told him we had considered this and also had considered

hiring someone to parachute from the plane but the problen

was that there was no way of duplicating the conditions

which existed at the time. He requested we put some type

of language in a teletypedout unis.

SUBJECT: NORJACK

I called the Bureau on 12/9/71 and talked to SA

HENRY SHUTZ. I told him it was our feeling here that we

should get cooperative newspapers to publish this bait

these $20 bills.

I wondered if the Bureau had given considera-

tion to instructing all SAC's to have this done.

He called back and said they were not going to do

this because frst, they did not think most newspapers would

publish it; second, they did not want all SAC's to have the

feeling that they had to get it published, which might cause

a great deal of difficulty around the field. He said he

thought their instructions were sufficient, that if we could

arrange to get it published in our division, and if we wanted

to call other offices on a selected basis, and see if the

SAC's could work out some arrangement to publish it, he would

leave that up to us. He definitely stated that we had

authority to get the list published if we so desired.

For recora purposes, I called SAC WHALEY at Albuguerque

research project

Air Force Base in New Mexioc

dealing with the effect on a body of high altitude parachuting

and the effect of low temperatures on a body in case a jump

was made.

I asked him to see if he could contact the

person responsible for the survey to give us some notions about

what effect this would have on the man making this jump.

I told him that the weather was clear to 1500 feet,

broken clouds to 5,000, solid above, and that the jump was

possibly made around 7,000 to 10,000 ft. at a time when the

"total average temperature" was minus 7 degrees.

hijacker and the cost (to the taxpayers) which was run up in getting the

which might help recover some of those printing costs and, with any

luck, might even tum up some of the items which are listed.

That is for the FBl to get a news release out to every daily newspaper

(thru AP or UPI wire) that copies of the list of bills, in booklet form,

are available to anyone interested at a cost of $1.00 apiece. Not that

she nor I subscribe to the "hero-worship" concept we've been reading

about, but we believe there'd be hundreds who would like to get ahold

of a copy... either for curiosity's sake or as a souvenir item. In addition
