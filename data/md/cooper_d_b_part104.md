Incomplete details of our conversation regarding hijacking::

I'.. "Ne"', of the pilot,, probably, referred to an. entire

crew. jumping in practice.. A co-pilot,, navigator, jump master

(11 jumpers carried) 'and

a cargo master.. Probably. a very

cohesive crew..

2.. The landing fleld,, If Sandpoint,, Ida,,, was approached

across a gorge not far from end of runwaysi

3.. The collar of the tall suspect, (headless horseman

costume) 'was six inches wide in rear,, but tapered to about

3 Inches in front,, and was lined with a brown fur..

4..0.I.A, connection- almost certain: 1f he flew outside

the continental U.s..

Saturday Review of Jan..l,, 1972, in

an article on the pentagon papers,, page 25,, end of paragraph 2::

"tater, Lansdale describes in a brief passage CIA"s "broprietary"

CIvil. Air Transport.. To the innocent world this company was

the National Airline of Iaiwan.!"

The "pilot's": experience, is probably liated China Airlipes..

And where would a. 727. operating out of Talwan drop

"personnel"y probably Mainland China..

5.. Where could $200,000 be changed on the black

market,, by some one with proper credentials?? Taiwan,. Hongkong

or Manila?" Where a CIA--China Airlines: pilot could have met

black market operators?

China: Airlines

operates. out of San Franciaco to Honolulu

Wed.» Frl., and Sun.. at 1:15 p.i.,, and on to. Taipel and

Hongkong,-The alriine 1s probably: so small that every pilot

would probably know every other pilot.. And would there be:

a lifotime pass for an. old trusted employee??

or a flight

with.an. old friend without being on; the manifest??

While the schedule was changed Dec..l,, Continental and

Pan. At operate flights out of Portland now every night-at ultewa

6:40 p.m..

china Airlines: operates flights from honolulu

Mon,, Tues.,, Thurs., and Sat at 1:15 p.I.. for Taiwan..

6..The pilot's clothes were expensive.. The closest

weave: I could spot in. Nordatrom Best'à were $ 205 and $ 215..

The faint off-white yellow shirts start at $22.501 If that.

faint single thread were: actually a Hongkong weave of a gold

thread. It would be more than $ 50:. Not. simple tastes...

conversation. While

lasked the pilot if he knew the identity of any of

the buildings below them.

The pilot identified many of the

times in the past.

In addition the pilot told

requirements for landing an aircraft at a field such as

that required in Great Falls, Montana.

Through conversation

it was obvious to

that the pilot was familiar with

both Missoula and Great Falls airports.

then asked

about the aircraft which was a 727 and asked the pilot if

there was a build-in skid that hit the ground every time

on the take-off which produced a characteristic noise.

pilot then responded, no, that the noise heard was the

landing wheels being

brought up at the exact moment when

the pilot begins his climb.

This led to a discussion of

the 727 aircraft.

jumped fron a 127 at which time the pilot said "In training,

we all had to jump.

It was a hell of a thrill." |

then said one word "Thailand?" at which time the pilot

responded "something like that" (indicating no).

The pilot

further stated that he hadn't been able to get a job flying

727 aircraft as a civilian due to his lack of flying hours.

emphasized the point that the pilot continually used

the word personnel rather than soldiers and it was noted that

it was not certain whether the pilot was flying for the

military or possibly the CIA. At this point,

dropped

the questioning.

The pilot got off the plane to stretch at Missoula,

Montana. While the pilot was off the plane another man took

his seat, at which time the pilot went to the forward cabin

upon returning to the aircraft. The aircraft made an

unscheduled stop at someplace which

believes to be

Sandpoint, Idaho.

The pilot got off the plane at this un-

scheduled stop as well and exited the aircraft in his shirt-

sleeves.

When the pilot came back aboard the aircraft he

entered with four men who were all dressed identically. It

is believed by

that these men were either para-

troovers or smoke junpers, both of which it was leamed by

have camps within a radius of 30 miles of Sandpoint,

Idaho.

When these four men came aboard, one woman seated on

the aircraft reacted by screaming.

Another man yelled "What

the hell is going on." "À bunch of motorcycle hoodlums?"

stated that one of the individuals mumbled something

like "We're paratroopers" but the wording at this point was

incoherent.

Whatever was said satisfied the man and woman

who both apologized.

The pilot took two of these men forward

and said that he could arrange for two of them to sit up

the smoke junpers who boarded the plane at Sandpoint, Idaho.

The pilot and the man that looked like the hijacker both sat

in the forward cabin and it is quite possible that the pilot

discussed the operations of the 121 aircraft and the

requirements for jumping from same, while seated with the

two smoke jumpers.

stated that he wrote to Senaton JACKSON

that if the FBI were to locate and identify the pilot, then

the CIA would have to identify this man as having been a

could have serious political implications when it is learned

by the chinese and could ruin the upcoming visit by President

NIXON to China.

Stated that as a nsult of the

hijacking we were to uncover this activity by the CIA, this

could be the biggest blunder since the U2 incident.

It is

for this reason that

feels we will never get to the

bottom of the hijacking and solve it until possibly after

the proposed conference by President NIXON in Mainland China.

claimed that he at one point wrote a report

which had been used by the Intelligence Division and which

had been hand-delivered by the Governor of the State of

Washington to then President HARRY TRUMAN. Seattle indices

reflect numerous references in security investigations, for

It is recommended that these indices references

be thoroughly reviewed before a reply is prepared as requested

Your hijacker - A "smoke jumper" probably, whose I.D.

, might be in the personnel files, of District 6, U.S.D: Ag, Portland.

A person probably who had done some jumping, fits the general

description, and was seen in company of a person who claimed to

have piloted a 727 on several missions to drop "personnel and

supplies" and who had jumped from a 727 "in training we all

jumped. It was a hell of a thrill," who could have inadvertently

or deliberately given the technical information. He, the pilot,

would have to have been an employe of the C.I.A. or one of its

private companies. To have known "smoke jumpers" he might also

have flown for the USDA during fire season.

When I first saw the sketch of the hijacker, my reaction was

"I have seen that man." Then I said aloud,' "impossible."

But on

later recall, I believé yes - it fits the pattern.

Flight 45, Northwest 727, Monday, September 13. "The Pilot"

got on at Miles City. Stewardess put a "Seattle" pin on the back

of the

seat. He did not occupy the seat after Missoula, and the

stewardess removed the pin after Sand point.

At either Missoula or Sand Point, four persons got on with

this "pilot," who caused quité a commotion by their identical dress.

The man directly behind me objected violently, and asked

"What the hell's going on." And that is when I am sure I looked

into a face similar to the one in the sketch, as he replied -

(moxe)

## Page 153

"Knock it off. We each purchased one seat.- and that's all you bought. "

One of the others murmured a word which I thought might be "paratroopers"

but probably was "smoke jumpers." The man apologized.

The voice was about two to three notes below normal. Even

and pleasant. And even the words, "knock it off" had no rasp or

harshness.

The costumes were totally black. Leather or shiny plastic.

The coats hung from shoulders to knees, straight without any form

fit. The caps were a half-kepi. Instead of a bill the right edge

was twisted into an upright piece in the middle of the forehead.

All wore the type glasses in the sketch. At the hinge, the

earpiece was wide, but of a lacy pattern. No part of the eye

visible.

Iwo of them sat in the back seat left. The "pilot: said

to the others to come up front, and he would "'arrange" so they could

sit together, and talk. So I got a height comparison. The pilot

about 5' 10". The next one 6' 1" or 6' 2" and slim, -slim. The

third man 5' 11" or 6', and broader.

Questions---

1. Is there a military specialty center, or hospital at

Sand Point - for either survival training, jumping or recuperation?

2. I am told there is no Dept. of Ag, smoke

. =

jumpers camp

at Sand Point, but there are at least four in Montana and idaho,

all of whose personnel records are at portland.

3. I think I recall an article on Smoke Jumpers, where it

described the outlandish costumes some units adopted.

4. If the C.I.A. Or its companies used a 727 for personnel

drops why keep it classified information? If they have, the Chinese

intelligence would certainly have known it by now. How many pilots

or jumpers have returned to private life?

Ibelieved the photograph of CATALANO bore

a very strong resemblance to the hijacker.

He particularly

noted the hairline, stating that if the hair in the photo-

graph observed was

marcelled as was the hijacker's, it

would be

an exceptionally good likeness.

He further noted

strong similarities in the high cheekbones, the long nose,

and eyes as he remembered the hijacker.

He was unable to determine from the photograph

the complexion of CATALANO but again emphasized the hi-

jacker had a swarthy or Latin type complexion and it appeared

to him CATALANO might have such a complexion.

He would

prefer to see a color photograph and additional photographs

"of CATALANO.

With regard to the recent hijacking of a plane involving

a $200,000 ransom payoff:

My son has a friend who drops by the house occasionally.

One evening about a week ago the friend came by and, in the

process of the conversation, he mentioned that he was going to

have a $200,000 wedding. Jokingly I asked if by some chance

he was in on the hijacking of the airplane. His answer was

yes, and my uncle who lives in the vicinity of Vancouver,

Washington, even looks like the hijacker and even owns a

Cessna 310, is an ex-paratrooper and does sky diving.

The last name of the friend's father is

The

father is a pilot and works for City Iransfer in Kent, wash.

My son informed me that his friend or his friend's father

went to Portland or vicinity at about the time the hijacking

transpired.

In regards to "D. B. Cooper" who hijacked the North-

west Orient Airlines 727 on the night of November 24, 1971,

I have the following information:

There is a man named Coovert who works as a Driver's

Examiner for the state in Gresham, Oregon. The man fits the

physical description and wears dark glasses

most of the time.

After the time of the hijacking he has become very much less

sociable. The man's history has been somewhat unstable as

far as employment, which includes work in a bank.. The above

information is hearsay but was convincing enough to be very

believable in addition to other information I cannot ac-

curately remember enough to convey correctly.

advised he had reviewed his records

relative to the name COOPER and located only two matters

under that name. He advised on 12/10/70, he shipped some

material to ROBERT D. COOPER, 23 West Galer, Apt. 309,

Seattle, Washington.

On 8/16/71, he shipped some material

to ROBERI COOPER, P. 0. Box 405, Snohomish, Washington.

He advised he has no reason to consider the above as

suspects other than the last name. He also advised from

the handwriting on the letters received requesting material,

it is likely that these are the same persons, as the hand-

writing is similar. The handwriting is available, should

it be desired for comparison purposes.

advised the only central records he

knows of regarding a mailing list for sky divers or clubs

would be the association in Monterey, California, which

distributes a magazine nationwide and should have a mailing

list.

advised that he doubts the person who

committed this crime was a sky diver. He noted that he

has heard that the parachutes furnished to the man were a

commercial brand named "Pioneer" and a now surplus Navy

parachute designated "NB-8", He stated if this is a fact,

he doubts the man is a sky diver inasnuch as anyone with

sky-diving experience would have asked for a sky-diving

type parachute, which neither of the above are.

further advised that the above paradates

would be hazardous to use inasnuch as that type of chute

would open very quickly, with a possibility of tearing,

and both have a high rate of descent and very limited

control. In his opinion, a person using such a chute would

probably have prior military jumping experience but vould

not have skydiving experience. He further noted that an

experienced sky diver would have asked for a chute such as

a "Para-Conmander", which would be readily available in an

area such as Seattle, Washington. This type of parachute

opens more slowly, is very maneuverable, and has a much

slower rate of descent.

PETE (NMN) PICCIOLO, bOrN 6/7/36, was recently

referxed to the los Angeles Division as a possibic suspect

in this matter as a know parachutist who had seriously

injured himself about one and one-half years ago. PICCIOLO'S

whereabouts on 11/24/71, was positively established through

payroll records at his place of employment, weber Air-

craft Company, Burbank, California, where examination of

time cards revealed he was at his employment the entire

day of 12/24/71.

on 8/1/73, PICCIDIO, an avid parachutist who

travels widely and writes articles concerning parachuting,

was interviewed at

his residence, 626 East Angeleno,

a parachutist named RAYMOND T. HEALD. He noted that HEAID

would probably not be considered in his mid torties untess

disguised and recalled him to be in his early thirties.

Knew HEALD to have been familiar with the seattle, Washington

and Portland, Oregon areas and believed hin capable of such

a crime. He advised he had last seen HEALD about two years

ago in Antioch, Califomia, at which time HRAID indicated

he was training to be an air controller. The only specific

information he knew was that HEALD's wife had worked for

awhile at Weber Aircraft Company where he, PICCIOLO, had

also been employed.

On the same date, records of Weber Aircraft

Company revealed RITA R. REAID was employed as a seamstress

at Weber Aircraft from 1969 to 2/5/70. She had furnished

her prior employments as the Elks Club, 515 S.W. Broadway,

Portland, Oregon, during 1962 and the Jolly Joan Restaurant,

1314 Auburn Avenue, Auburn, Washington, fron February to

October 1963. She was a cocktail waitress on both occasions. 7!

Her husband was shown as RAYMOND T. HEAID, born 3/30/39

39

and former addresses were indicated as 8024 Woodman Avenue,

Van Nuys, California, and

. 14701 Rayen, Apartment 103,

Panorama City, California.

0n. 8/2/73,

Van Nuys, California, advised they

and

recalled

RAY HEALD.

They advised about April 1971,

HEAID had some type of trouble at the Air Control Center

for the federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at Palmdale,

California, and was transferred to the Santa Monica,

California Airport as an air controller. He had then applied

for a position in Denver, Colorado, but sonething happened

at the. last minute and he did not get the job in Denver.

Sometime shortly after April 1971, the HEADs indicated

they were moving to Seattle or Portland where it was their

understanding RAY was to work at an unknown airport. They

had assumed that he was working an an air controlder until

receipt of a Christmas card from RITA MAID in December

1972, at which time RITA advised that RAY was attending

college and working as a part-time disc jockey in Ashland,

Oregon. He was studying to be a television sportscaster.

A return address on the card displayed by I

indicated

advised, after viewing the artist's conception,

that the eyes, nose and mouth of the artist's conception

were similar to those of RAY HEALD.

_could note

no similarity

They described HEAL as a white male in his

early thirties, 5'11", 180 pounds, dark brown hair, rugged,

outdoor, well-tanned complexion, well spoken, polite, and

handsome appearing.

They recalled that almost the entire

time they knew HEALD from mid 1970 to about April 1971,

he was clean shaven; however, just prior to his departure

he was noted to be growing a

beard.

On 8/3/73,

Santa Monica Airport Terminal Tower, Santa Monica, California,

advised RAYMOND T. HEALD was personally know to him. In

early 1971 he was advised by his superiors that HEALD, an

air controller trainee at Palmdale, California, was being

transferzed to Santa Monica as a result of nunexous problems

he was involved in at Palmdale.

confidentially

stated it was indicated to him that HEAID should be fired

but due to the manner in which reams of evidence had been

mishandled, his superiors did not feel a hearing at this

time was feasible.

He stated that among allegations was the

fact that HEALD was involved in the sale of marijuana to

trainees at the Air Control Center, Palmdale. Shortly after

his axrival at Santa Monica, HEALD was known to be abusing

the privilege of trainees wherein they were allowed to fly

in the cockpits of aircratt to study traffic. On one specific

occasion, HEAD traveled in the cockpit to Phoenix,

Arizona, then called from phoenix just prior to the time

he was due on duty at Santa Monica stating he was sick.

It was learned that actually HEALD was judging a parachuting

contest in Phoenix.

stated HEALD had started as a trainee

in Phoenix,

was

later transferred to Alaska, and in 1968

or 1969 was assigned as a trainee at Palmdale, California.

HEALD had recently married a "flashy-looking blonde"

whom

described as the cocktail waitress of bunny type,

and was several years older than HEALD. At the time HEALD

left due to his resignation on 4/17/71, he indicated he was

going to Oregon and just relax:

Several months later

(believed to be eight or nine months) in early 1972, HEALD

stopped briefly at the Santa Monica Airport and indicated

government general.

On 2/8/72 witness CORD SPRECKEL was displayed

photographs of JOHN DONALD PAGE (Sub 193). SPRECKEL stated that

based on the photographs of PAGE which were displayed to him

he could not positively eliminate PAGE as a suspect in the

captioned hijacking.

SPRECKEL, stated that the hijacker

appeared to be about the same age as PAGE in his opinion and

there are facial characteristics which are similar to that of

the hijacker.

SPRECKEL stated that he would not positively

identify PAGE as the hijacker, but stated that he felt it would

be in the best interest of the FBI if he did not eliminate

PAGE as a suspect because there is a slight possibility PAGE

could be identical with the hijacker.
