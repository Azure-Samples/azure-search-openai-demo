Result of examination:

It was concluded that 252 through Q54 were prepared

submitted by Los Angeles

with a communication dated 9/25/72.

It could not be determined whether the writer of

Q19 through Q51 was involved in the preparation of the other

specimens received in this case, because of a lack of com

paraole vriting and distortion in portions of the material

received in this matter.

No watermarks, indented writing, or other features

were found on 252 through 054 which would be of value in

determining the source of these specimens.

HIJACK

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male boarded

Northwest Orient Flight #305 at Portland, Oregon: At approxi-

mately 3:22 PM while the flight was en route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated to the

stewardess that his briéfcase

contained a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four parachutes

in exchange for the safety of the 36

plane.

passengers aboard the

the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes and the money, the hijacker

allowed all passengers and two airline stewardesses to

deplane..

He

then ordered the remaining crew members into

the first-class section of the aircraft and informed them he

desired to fly to Mexico City.

The hijacker instructed that

the plane proceed

in a southerly direction and fly at a low

altitude and slow speed

which would enable the rear door

of the plane (Boeing 727) to be opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where the

plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the hijacker, two

parachutes, and the ransom money had disappeared when

plane was inspected at Reno, Nevada.

Artist conception drawings of the aircraft hijacker

were prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Exhibit

Section and are considered a reasorablelikeness.

The black

and white composites were prepared initially, and sometime

later the color composites were prepared to depict the

hijacker's complexion and age more graphically.

Comparison of the enclosed driver's license photograph

does not disclose any marked resemblance to the artist's conception

drawing of "D.B. Cooper".

On 1/25/82

California, telephone number L

Jwas contacted relative to

the intormation turnished in his letter to the Seattle Ottice

referred to above.

stated that he was prompted to write the

letter after viewing

In Search Of" episode on television con-

cerning "D.B. Cooper" in the captioned hijacking. In

estimation, the artist's conception drawing of "Cooper" reminded

him of Clemens.

He had no other reason than this believed resemblance

to consider Clemens a suspect in the captioned matter, but believed

that Clemens was a retired airline pilot, although he did not know

for which airlines Clemens had flown.

Clemens had never

of any paratrooper-type experience and was fairly tight-lipped re-

garding his personal life.

believed that this could be

accounted for, possibly by the lact that Clemens was in apparently

failing health due to a terminal disease resulting ultimately in his

death.

Other than the above,

was able to furnish no infor-

mation other than that contained in

his original letter, indicating

any additional reason why Clemens

should be considered a possible

suspect in this case.

The enclosed photograph is being forwarded to Seattle

Ior possible display to witnesses in this matter. No further

investigation regarding Clemens is contemplated at San Diego unless

requested by Seattle.

It not for my inherent procrastion you might have gotten this

letter a year or two earlier, and if not for the urgings of many

of my friends you may not have raceived it at all.

You may not

be the best personicontact; but I lifted your name from the

Seattle P I Sunday Northwest magazine section. To shorten

what otherwise could be a long story I will say that it is

possible I may know the real name of the man called "Cooper."

My frionas have urged me to contact the FBI and tell the same story

I have told them. They labor under the delusion I'll get rich

Irom all'ewards. But reward or not I will relate to you, or some

other agent, what I know (and do not know) if you can do what you

can to kuep my name confidential.

I have no need at all for a homocide bent, revenge crazy crook on

my trail sometime in the future!

I lost track of this man sometime in 1964, but from what little I

know of the hijacking case everything fits. The composite sketch

•Is not a likeness, but two of the features

are certainly his.

I haven't said anything up to now for two reasons.

1. The nagging. fear I could be causing an innocent person a

lot of trouble, and

2.

should I be right the guilty party would not look to

kinaly on me.

I say something now for a number of reasons.

Unlike my friends who

are positive I once knew the man who was to

become D. B. Cooper,

I am not sure. I guess I'd like to know too.

Please feel free to have an agent or yourself contact me. Maybe

you will agree with my friends.

any evidence of buried ammunition cans.

These Agents remained

at sunrise October 9, 1975. They were joined by nine U.S.

Marine Corps personnel equipped with Marine Corps metal detectors

and entire area depicted on map was searched three separate

times.

Numerous metal items, such as nails, horse shoes,

veer cans, etc., were located below the ground surface and

dug up; however, again no ammunition cans or loot was located.
