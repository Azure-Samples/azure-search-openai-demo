DB Cooper-35185

RAin or shine,

three days a week, the West Seattie Road Runners

hear the welcome and familiar command:

"All right, everybody out on the track!"

The Road Runners is a track club formed last September by a group

of West Seattle parents to provide a track and field program to young

sters from 7 to 17 years of age. It is registered with the Amateur Ath

Jetic Union, Pacific Northwest Association, and is supervised by Gary

Day, head coach.

Day, who promotes track whenever possible, believes the youngsters

develop better self confidence and sportsmanship working both as a team

and competing as an individual.

The Road Runners competed in the 1969 cross-country season and

have numerous meets scheduled this season. Each boy or girl is watched

carefully by Day and his assistants for proper conditioning against

muscle strains or other injuries. And they also make sure the youngsters

have fun.

-ti {.

By means of a survey type questionnaire

we have been able to list many drop zone

facilities for which previously there was-litle

or no information available. As a word of cau-

tion; this solicited information has not always

been verifiable, and the reader: should there-

fore be prepared for occasional

discrepäncies

between the reported and the actual facilities

available at some DZs. Generally, those drop

zones which have been visited byja USPA staff

member (preceded by a star) jard those op-

erated by USPA affiliated clubs'stiould be con-

sidered the most reliably reported.

In the event the reader discovers an error in

the listed information, or has' suggestions for

the revision of future editions, please' send

these commenis to Box 109,, Monterey, Cali-

fornia.

.IT

It is hoped that this new format of a State

by State breakdown of drop zones, area safety

officers, FAA facilities, and the USPA' affiliated

clubs will provide an easily referenced index

of the information most necessary lo, users of.

this Directory.

This publication is presented as a service of

4208 (a)(2) to seven years for robbing a Denver Savings & Loan Association of $3;000,

pretending he had a pistol. He was serving both federal and state probation at the

time of the offense. He used the infant child of a friend as a hostage in escaping

officials when first apprehended.

Only during the last year has he been engaged in

criminal activities, during which time he has received two suspended-sentences for:

serious offenses.

Our inmate comes from a large family of twelve children. He married at age

nineteen, shortly after quitting high school prematurely. His marital life was stormy,

and after a separation and a reunion he and his wife separated again. Although he was.
