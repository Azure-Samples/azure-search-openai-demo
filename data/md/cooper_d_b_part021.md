Re: RANSOM MONEY

was microfilmed by the L

Thm dans money obtained by Northwest Airlines

oxiginal roll of film contained on one reel, was picked up

and sent to the Laboratory by

United Airlines courier.

Since the above roll of film

contained the serial numbers of $230,000, it was necessary

to furnish the serial numbers of the $30,000 which was not

included in the ransom (the ransom being $200,000) .

Because the Laboratory was having difficulty with

eliminating the serial numbers, they requested we obtain

the complete list of serial numbers which were deleted from

the original listing of the $230,000.

In the meantime, the

had prepared another amount of

ransom money of $230,000

and included in that, the $30,000 which had been taken

from the first ransom money as mentioned in paragraph one

above.

The

then loaned to us,

two roels of microfilm which contains

their current ransom

money and which included the bills which had been taken from

the first ransom money. These two rodls of microfilm were

sent to the Laboratory and were used to compile an accurate

list of the ransom money given to the hijacker.

All three reels of film returned by the Bureau

with the following dispositions:

The reel containing the ransom money given to the

hijacker is being maintained in the Seattle Office as evidence

February 1, 1972

Re: Your letter of Nov. 29th, '71

Dear Mr. Milnes:

Thank you for expressing your appreciation of my observations. I see

someone else had observations along the same line and put them to

sood use in a later hijacking. I fail to see, however, why the Al

'orce allowed the parachute bugging to be brinted in the papers.

I hear now there is great alarm concerning the number of hijackings

recently. Among other things, I'm sure another escape is feared.

I have given this matter some thought, and therefore, I have another

observation you might benefit from:

The only obvious deviation from the established pattern "Mir. Cooper"

used that has not been tried is to actually jump from the plane

with the hostage. If the hifacker has a small plane or car as an

escape vehicle and a pre-determined jump-site, he could pull it off.

Parachutes can be designed to control the rate of descent via draft

holes in the top center of the silk,

I believe. Therefore, the way

to roll the escape would be to radically vary the descent

factor of

would separate the hijacker from

drop; meanwhile helicopter teams could rescue the hostage, subdue

the hijacker, while the Air Force could track the escape vehicle.

this idea would probably not work as smoothly as presented here.

but it is a way to stop such an occurrence. You may rest assure

I keep these ideas to myself, and for added credulence, I was

granted a security clearance while employed at the Boeing Co.

Thank you for your time. I don't expect you to reply to this letter.

Just keep it in your hip pocket, just in case.

Dear Sir:

This will confirm an opinion given on February

3, 1972, by Assistant United States Attorney

to Special Agent CHARLES E. FARRELL of this office, concerning

parachutes which were involved in this case.

The hijacker of Northwest Alrlines Flight $305

was given four parachutes while the plane was on the ground

at Seattle-Tacoma International Aliport.

Two of these

parachutes were apparently used by the hijacker when he

parachuted from the plane. The remaining two parachutes

were still on the plane when it landed at Reno, Nevada.

One of the parachutes was Intact, but the other had been

opened and three of the shroud lines had been cut.

Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis,

contacted the Seattle office on February 3, 1972, to inguire

as to the disposition of the two parachutes which had been

left on the plane. I

advised he has been receiving

inquiries from the person who supplied the parachutes either

to have the parachutes returned to him, or have Northwest

Airlines pay for them.

when the above facts were discussed

the praised that no eate needes ot this
