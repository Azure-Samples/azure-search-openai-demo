A code name for this case has been given by

the Bureau as NORJAK and will be used in all communications.

There are currently 939 suspects, 922 of whom have

been eliminated.

New suspects are being developed and appro-

priate investigation is being instituted. No promising sus-

pects are under consideration at this time.

Positive information will be immediately forwarded

to the Bureau by appropriate communication.

The Bureau advised by teletype dated 5/5/78 to all

offices that press inquiries concerning this important hijacking

matter should be limited to certain specific information which

was set out in the teletype and also all offices were to for-

ward to Seattle any additional press inquiries received at

other tield divisions in order to preclude inadvertent

disclosure of confidential information.

The investigative period of this report reflects

the fact that investigation has been conducted on a daily

basis by the Seattle Office as well as other divisions and

also foreign countries.

The Bureau will note that during

the period of this report the Seattle file increased by

approximately 185 serials for an average of about 30 serials

Re suspect HOWARD ROGER MASTERSON.

Re Los Angeles airtel to Portland dated 7/25/78.

For information of los Angeles and Seattle, on

7/25/78

Washington County

Sheriff's Office, Hillsboro, Oregon, furnished the

following information:

HOWARD ROGER MASTERSON, white male, DOB 10/6/46,

was found

dead of a drug overdose in Washington County on

5/30/72. The Washington County Sheriff's Office conducted

the necessary investigation which included the positive

identification of MASTERSON by several immediate relatives.

Investigation was conducted under their case number 72-3108.

The investigation established, in addition to the positive

identity of MASTERSON, the fact that the death was due to

voluntary ingestion of drugs.

continued that recently several relatives

Of MASTERSON, mOre

distant than the ones who identified

him at the time of his death, have raised the question as

to whether MASTERSON may still be alive, and as a result it

has been suggested that the buried body be exhumed for

re-identification.

Istated his office is completely

satisfied with the validity of the identification and does

not intend

_to go any further with the

idea. He stated

the people that raised the doubts alleged that they

felt there

was a possibility that MASTERSON was still alive

and living

in Mexico using the last name COOPER. He said

that these

individuals inferred that possibly MASTERSON

might have been identical with UNSUB in captioned case.

that MASTERSON could have had nothing to do with the

captioned matter because of the vast discrepancy in age

and physical description.

He stated he feels it is merely

a ruse, those members of the family desirous of establishing

re-identification to bring pressure to bare for such an

operation.

He stated he was advising the Portland FBI Office

inasmuch as members of the family indicated that they

were going to take the matter to the FBI since they had

turned down by the sheriff's office.

In view of the above circumstances and considering

the considerable discrepancy in age and description, it is

not belived necessary for the FBI to take any further action

in this matter, and accordingly Portland plans no further

action concerning this suspect.

Approximately four to five years ago, he was fishing

on Lake Merwin,: located near Woodland, Washington. While

doing so, he found

a piece of nylon cord in the lake, which

was badly deteriorated. This cord was white in color and it

was his opinion that it was part of an old ski rope, inasmuch

as it had a mechanical weave, much like a ski rope.

He stated

that at first, he became quite excited when he saw the cord,

thinking that

perhaps it was from a parachute,

but he realized

the cord was not twisted like a parachute cord. He stated

that because of this, he then threw away the cord.

The above is for information purposes.

Re ROBERT WESLEY RACKSTRAW, Sub #933-

Re Sacramento airtel to the Bureau, dated 3/8/79.

For information of all recipients, on 3/15/79, AUSA

District of Oregon, Portland, Oregon, advised

as follows:

Departmental Attorney

_telephonically advised

this date that he had received a communication from one

I Attornev.

Oakland, California,

telephonel

advised

him that he represents

a client whom he did not identify who is willing to provide

information which will prove he is the UNSUB in this matter

in return for immunity from federal prosecution. L

instructed l

to have the Portland Case Agent contact

by telephone in an attempt to determine the validity

of this claim and to

evaluate the potential for benefit to this

investigation.

It is noted that during the period April, 1978 to

March, 1979, investigation has been conducted to eliminate

or involve one ROBERT WESLEY RACKSTRAW. RACKSTRAW is now

only 35 years old, and at the time of the hijacking in this

matter, would have been approximately 28 years old.

UNSUB in

this matter was described as late 40's or early 50's in 1971,

would indicate a disparity of approximately 20 years, and RACKSTRAW

would not appear to be a very good suspect.

RACKSTRAW has been the subject of highly publicized

prosecution for major crimes in California, and is now incar-

in a California penitentiary.

The Sacramento Office

advised in May, 1978, that at that time RACKSTRAW was in

custody feigning a back injury which required him to be transported

in a wheelchair. Custodial personnel felt he was doing this in

an attempt to effect a possible escape.

It was noted that

RACKSTRAW is a former U. S. Army Green

Beret and Vietnam veteran

highly skilled

in the use of his hands and feet as weapons.

Sacramento Office further advised that on

1 5/4/78,

Stockton, California Police

Department advised he has heard that

Lis a lawver

He wondered if this might indicate that RACKSTRAW's

suspected involvement in the 1975 theft of explosives at the

Felton Quarry, Santa Cruz,

California, some of which were later

acquired from

the New World Liberation Front by the FBI at

Richmond, California in early 1976, might mean that RACKSTRAW

Lake Merwin, Washington.

On her way home on 4/22/79, from the lot, she noticed a piece

of white cloth in a tree on the right hand side of the road

going south, approximately five miles from Lake Merwin, between

Fargher Lake and Amboy, Washington.

She advised the cloth

appeared to be heavy silk or possibly fiberglass material,

raveled on the edges and about 18 inches long and 12 inches

wide.

She immediately thought of the COOPER case and thought

the cloth could be a piece of the parachute. She advised she

could direct an Agent to the site.

_ On 4/24/79,

accompanied SC JOAN M. THOMAS

to the location and pointed out

the cloth, which was not possible to identify from the highway.

Upon retrieval, however, it was determined the cloth was part

Re Butte airtel to Portland, 12/27/78-164-81-19°

Enclosed for Seattle is a business cará of D. B.

COOPER, Director, Airline Jump Operations, Cooper's Sky

Diving School, Sky Harbor Field, Salem, Oregon.

As evidenced by the information contained in the

enclosed card furnished Seattle, it appears the card is a

novelty item of no investigative value.

There is no Sky

Harbor Field located at Salem, Oregon.

On 1/4/79, inquiries with officials at the

Salem, Oregon, airport and the Salem Flight Service determined

there are no sky diving schools located at Salem.

UAC Seattle, no additional inquiries will be made

regarding Cooper's Sky Diving School.

the probability that this decai came

hijacked by COOPER is about ninety-nine per cent. He noted

that there is a slight difference in the color of the

lettering of the decals placed on the aircraft and that

recovered. This, of course, could be accounted for by the

weather conditions.

The second thing noted by

area for the past eight years. He thought that a decal in

this condition would have been handled by preditors more
