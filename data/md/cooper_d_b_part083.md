LOSE MIN FOR

NIGHT FIRE SUPPRESSION

In order to perform the mission of fire suppression

-and-rescue, fi-48-pilots-must-know-and-master-the

problems ofaerialfiresuppression underalfconditions

There is considerable difference between day and night

fire suppression, for example, and earrying out such

a mission at night in an unfamiliar area is probably

the most hazardous to be encountered

Controlled

night fire fighting training, recently authorized by the

Air Rescue Service, is not overly hazardous, however.

Since there is still relatively little experience in

"actual night tire helicopter operations and no schooled

solution to all situations, the following discussion of

night fire suppression problem areas is offered for

information, analysis and evaluation to aid the pilot in

theorizing on the action he willtake ina given situation.

With advance knowledge of the probtems to be encouns

tered, pilots wilf be better equipped to act with the

professionalism essential to timely and effective fires

lighting rescue.

PROBLEM:

Blinding ground personnel with helicopter

lights

DISCUSSION: This problem occurs. during initial fire-

kit hook-up,

during landing approaches, when fighting

fires, and when retrieving the firekitfrom the mission

site.

Proper use of helicopter lighting is essential.

On the firekit pick-up with only the floodlights on, it is

easier for the hook-up man to avoid looking directly

into the lights.

Blinded, he cannot see sufficiently to

effect a safe and proper hook-up.

On landing approaches

the same situation appears.

"OFF"

The landing light must be

if the ground signalman is to be reliéd upon.

Ground personnel can expect to be momentarily blinded

are picked up by rotor-wash magnifies this problem.

As the fire diminishes, it is possible for the

fire-

fighters hood to refract the helicopter lights.

Fire--

fighters should be cautioned in this area.

The pilot

should be alert for the possibility that ground personnel

are trying to operate with the loss of night vision.

It

is conceivable that they could attempt a side approach

being unable to determine the front.

The

blinding light problem is also encountered in

night hoist and sling operations.

PROBLEM: Loss of instrument visibility

DISCUSSION: Due to the many, demands of the fire-

fighting operation, the pilot should give full attention

outside the cockpit.

The brilliance of the fire will

cause the pilot to lose night vision and

instrument

visibility.

Instruments are monitored by the copilot

using a flashlight.

Before takeoff is

attempted, the

pilot should have instrument

visibility.

Perhaps a

delay to await return of night vision is

warranted.

PROBLEM: Hypnotic effect of fire

DISCUSSION:

references.

Fire destroys and distorts horizontal

The dancing flames have a hypnotic effect

which attracts the pilot's attention to the extent that he

may be unable to detect aircraft movement.

The pilot

must make a conscious effort to shift his

attention,

check altitude,

check hover reference,

check fire-

fighters, check for hazards to the helicopter,

etc.

Firefighters make a good hover reference in the fire.

The pilot must avoid looking at the brilliant part of the

blaze as his perspective can be

distorted and erratic

aircraft control can result.

The copilot should mon-

itor instruments, hover position, and be alert to warn

the pilot as necessary.

Portable Dock Box Aids Det. 4

by John D. Elliott

Field Service Representative

BIT. + B2NC

RATS

ARs Det. 4, WARC,

Paine Field, Wash. - T/Sgt.

James E. Johnson of this detachment has come up with

this inexpensive, but highly efficient, mobile dock box

as a means of expediting H-43B maintenance.

Soon

aiter checking into the detachment,

Sergeant Johnson

decided that a portable dock stand would be of help to

maintenance personnel.

He checked around the base

until he found an armament box with the proper dimen-

sions and then began a conversion project with the re-

sult shown.

The dock box, mounted on four wheels, allows special

tools and other items to be taken to the aircraft rather

than taking the aircraft to the tools.

The top of the box

has a door on the front which opens down to provide a

small writing table or a work bench for minor main-

tenance jobs.

On the left side of this door.

a file is

mounted to house the PE cards. Each individual slot

is marked and the partitions are slanted so the cards

will not fall out when the door is raised or lowered.

Inside the door,

on the top part of the box, is storage

space for special tools.

Each tool has a specific place

marked with a tag. The door to the top portion has locks

for security.

The bottom portion of the dock box has sliding doors

with large compartments for storage of larger items

such as engine slings, etc.

Large special tools are

also stored in this area.

Often used items such as

grease guns,

oil cans and some bench stock items are

stored in this portion of the box. Installation of a small

16

bin area is being considered to store common usage

items for periodic inspection.

The sliding doors are

secured by locks.

The advantages of this portable dock box are many,

and for the most part, apparent.

The box is especially

useful for periodic inspections but is certainly not

limited to this. The box allows easy reference to tools,

keeps them in a centrally located place and makes in-

ventory very easy.

Having the PE cards near the air-

craft saves man hours going back and forth to the Main-

tenance Office and frees the Dock Chief to be near the

aircraft while the inspection is being performed.

The

chances of misplacing a card are lessened because the

box is so handy to replace the card when the work has

been accomplished.

Small items which can

normally

be lost easily are located so that they are always avail-

able.

Items such as glue, gaskets etc. have a specific

place in the box and are returned to that place when the

men are finished using them.

Each separate compart-

ment in the box can be locked, so loss from pilferage

or borrowing is held to a minimum.

Sergeant Johnson is continually working to improve

this dock box but his basic idea, coupled with his ini-

tiative to improve the efficiency of the unit during peri-

odic inspections, deserves special mention.

His con-

tribution to Detachment 4 has

meant savings in

man

hours, government equipment and has helped to main-

tain quality maintenance of Air Rescue Service Aircraft.

KAMAN ROTOR TIPS

PROBLEM: Pilot's loss of visual ground reference

DISCUSSION

In an actual crash, off base, the crash

naverseems to occurin an ideal spot. Generally there

are tigh trees, swamp, dry grass, leaves, snow, sain,

high humidity, smoke, sand, or aust that complicates

the mission. All of these objects will refract the heli-

copter landing lights. The problem becomes magnified

when the light from the tireis also retracted. RESULT:

The pilot can lose ground perspective. The pilot can

control one light source. Therefore, as the helicopter

descends to the site, the pilot should turn "OFf" the

landing light as this light refracts greater than the

floodlights. When illumination from the fire is suffi-

cient to maintain visual contact, it is advisable to turn

"OF" the floodlights. Use floodlights as the fire di-

minishes,

PROBLEM: Difficulty in obtaining adequate site eval-

uation

DISCUSSION:

When people are trapped in a burning

airerait, there is apt to be an over-anxious attitude on

the part of rescue personnel.

This over-anxiousness

can result in an inadequate site evaluation, It haze is

present, floodlights will restrict visibility. A prompt,

complete landing area determination mustbe made.

A

stew, steep approach provides more time to determine

the sinoraftcommitmentend insurese safer go-around

if necessary.

Remember to consider the possibility of the H-43B

exhaust-igniting inflammables that may beup windrof

the fire."

*An engineering change proposal has been submitted to

the Air Force by Kaman Aircraft which, ti accepted,

would modify the tail pipe and should eliminate this

possibility -Ed.

PROBINM Spatrai disortentation

DISCUSSION: Dancing flames, flashing lights, lossol

horizontal and vertical references, glare, shadows,

and undetected aircraft movement combine to cause

spatial disorientation (vestigo)

This can be avotted

by concentration and determination. The pilot and cos

pilot must understand that vertigo is very dangerous.

Should it occur,

the copilot must take contral of the

aircraft.

These many problems make it appear that night tire-

fighting is too hazardous to attempt. With operating

experience in this night firefighting environment, hows

ever, these problems become second nature.

Confi-

dence ts gained. Training will assuresufficient knowl

edge, experience, and ability to effect timely rescue

in all conditions.

functions are classified primarily into two

types: (A) The switch contacts open before

N1 RPM reaches 28 to 30% and the engine

cannot be started. This type malfunction

is caused when the set screw (see figure 2,

number 2) works loose, allowing the RPM

adjusting screw (number 1) to change to a

lower RPM adjustment. (B) The switch con-

tacts fail to open after a successful engine

start. This allows the engine starting sys-

tem to remain energized and keeps the

starter energized and connected to the D.C.

essential bus. The starter is a direct drive

starter-generator driven by the engine, and

when energized, it produces a D.C. voltage.

This unregulated and unfiltered voltage is

providing a source of D. C. voltage to the

D. C. essentialbus, to which it is connected,

and can have a detrimental effect on the air-

craft's

electrical-electronics

systems.

Also, if this condition goes undetected

or

is

allowed to exist after detection,

the

starter will overheat and may cause a fire.

The recommended means for detecting this

type of malfunction after the engine is op-

erating, is to remove the APU, switch off

the aircraft's battery and D. C. generator

and then determine if any lights in the cock-

pit are glowing. If lights are glowing, it is

an indication that the starter is still ener-

gized, due to a malfunctioning speed switch,

and providing D. C. voltage to the D. C.

essential bus.

This condition can be tem-

porarily resolved by pulling the

"engine

starting' circuit breaker and then re-setting

it.

This action does not open the speed

switch contacts, but deenergizes the start-

ing relay, which disconnects the "latching"

switch paralleled across the start switch

and deenergizes the complete starting sys-

tem. The described malfunction is caused

when several parts in the switch's actuating

mechanism wear, changing the stroke length

required to actuate the micro switch.

Considering that most speed switch mal-

functions are caused by the changing of the

initial RPM adjustments, itis safeto assume

that the majority of malfunctioning units can

be made to function properly after a few re-

latively simple adjustments.

It is recom-

mended that the following procedures be ad-

hered to when adjusting a speed switch, P/N

AE47-2 and -3. The procedures are divided

into three groups corresponding to the type

of malfunction encountered and taking into

consideration the availability of a special

cut-away cover, P/N SK-11464.

HU2K-1

ACTIVITIES

Kaman Aircraft reps who will serve as Field Service

Representatives when the HU2K-1 joins the fleet, re-

cently completed a maintenance course at NAS Lake-

hurst,

N.J., as an accelerated introduction prior 1o

undergoing highly-specialized training at the company

plant.

The course,

primarily established for Navy

personnel,

was conducted by military instructors at-

tached to NAMT Det. 1070 andutilized one of the HU2K-1

maintenance trainers built by KAC for the Navy.

The decision to send "contractor reps" to Lakehurst

was based primarily on the spirit of cooperation which

has existed between the Navy and contractor since work

first began on the maintenance trainer.

Navy experts

workedclosely with KAC engineers during the year-and-

a-half of research and planning which are represented

in the device.

As a result,

the trainer is one of the

most efficient ever developed and training time can be

cut drastically through its use.

With this in mind,

NAMTG, Memphis, Tenn., to use the Lakehurst facil-

ities to complete their quota of students for these classes

and at the same time the field representatives taking

transitional training could receive the benefit of the

"nut-shell" instruction provided by the trainer.

Another benefit which the reps received while at Det.

1070 was the opportunity afforded to study Navy training

methods and also to discuss with the instructors the

questions which had been asked by Navy personnel at-

tending preceding classes.

supplied by knowledgeable instructors is,

invaluable to the men who will later work closely with

Navy HU2K-1 maintenance crews.

Navy instructors received benefit from discussion with

the reps to help refine their training course.

Earlier, the Navy instructors had attended an eight-

week course at KAC in the operation and maintenance of

the trainer, two of which were constructed by Kaman

Aireraft.for the Navy. One was sent to the detachment

at Lakehurst, the otheris now at Det. 1071, NAAS Ream

Each of the maintenance trainers consists of four

panels: (1) Hydraulic; (2) Flight Controls, Transmission

and Power Plant; (3) Electrical; (4) Navigation System.

All of the panels are mobile and the main trainer can be

disassembled in three minutes so that its individual

main components, such as the Automatic Stabilization

can be studied in separate classrooms.

This allows the varlous specialty ratings to receive

simultaneous and uninterrupted instruction,

eliminating the need to wait while one group is checked

Afterward, when the trainer is

reassembled (again a matter of minutes), these special-

ists are afforded the opportunity to see how their areas

function in conjunction with others in the helicopter, thus

giving them the "whole picture."

To make the trainer as realistic as possible, actual

USAF HUSKIE BREAKS ANOTHER RECORD

CAPT. CHESTER R. RATCLIFFE, JR.

An Air Force H-43B HUSKIE has claimed a second

international distance record within a three-week period.

Both of the records were previously held by the Soviet

Union.

Established on July Sth was a straight-line distance

record of 900 miles.

The flight originated at Hill Air

later near Springfield,

Minn.

Pilot on the flight was

Capt. Chester R. Ratcliffe, Jr., Commander of ARS

Det. 24, CARC, MATS; Kincheloe Air

Force Base,

The previous record of 761.027 miles was set

by a Soviet Mi-1 helicopter on September 21, 1960.

Soviet Mi-1 helicopter in June,

1960.

The H-43B,

manufactured by Kaman Aircraft Corp.

of Bloomfield,

Conn.; now holds five

international

records for helicopters.

The three other records held

by the HUSKIE are:

MULTI-SPEED SWITCH OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

by W. H. Zarling

P. A. Greco

Analysts, Electrical-Electronics

Field Service Department

When starting the engine in most heli-

copters, it is necessary to press and then

hold the start button until the engine is in

operation, In the H-43B HUSKIE, however,

the start is made by merely pushing the

button momentarily and then releasing it,

thus setting the automatic engine starting

system in operation. This allows the pilot

time to prepare for flight while the engine is

starting and also minimizes the time re-

quired to get the helicopter airborne and on

the way to perform its rescue mission.

the NI tachometer.

The multi-speed switch

and NI tachometer are mechanically driven

by the Nl reduction accessary gear box.

Once the engine is started, the automatic

starting system is deenergizedby the multi-

speed switch. This switch, P/N AE47-2 and

-3, is

preset to deenergize the starting

system at 28 to 30 percent of N1 (gas tur-

bine) RPM. Comprised of a normally closed

micro switch and an actuating mechanism

which operates by centrifugal force,

the

multi-speed switch is located on the engine

between the NI tachometer mounting pad and

fuel to flow into the engine; energizes the

At this time

the start button can be released and the

system remains self energized.

A normal engine start should be accom-

plished when N1 RPM reaches

28 to 30%.

The speed switch actuating mechanism is

adjusted to actuate the micro switch between

MISSION REPORT FROM LUKE AFB

Detachment 15, WARC (MATS), Luke AFB, Arizona;

of the runway,

It took the fire trucks approximately

thirty minutes to rig a fire hose long enough to reach

the scene.

During all this time,

the helicopter was the

only fire suppression vehicle that could reach the scene.

This Detachment has flown a total of 1104 missions

during the above mentioned period.

These missions

cover all types such as bailouts,

military crashes,

civilian crashes,

military evacuations, civilian evac-

uations, search and recovery, and scrambles with the

fire suppression kit. There have been eighteen bailouts

of which one had to be picked up with the hoist because

of the rough terrain the pilot had landed in.

Out of

thirty-four evacuations,

twenty-eight were civilians.

The hoist was used to pick up fifteen of these evac-

uations and the Stokes litter had to be used on two oc-

casions

because of the

involved.

Thirty-two aircraft have crashed within our area and

eleven have been within fifteen miles of the base.

The

H-43B has aided greatly in the recovery of eighteen

deceased persons.

On 24 April 1960,

Capt. Walter C. McMeen,

15 Commander, flew the first rescue mission with the

H-43B in the field.

This mission appeared in the July,

1960, Rotor Tips which is published monthly by the

Kaman Aircraft Corp.

Captain McMeen was placedon

the Scroll of Honor for his accomplishment.

This one

mission proved the outstanding capability of the H-43B

"Huskie" as a rescue vehicle and thus was the begining

of a long list of mission accomplishment in the H-43B.

All missions that will be mentioned were flown in the

H-43B and cover the period from 24 April 1960, to 5

July 1962.

The most outstanding mission

accomplishment de-

veloped on 5 July 1962.

On this date, this detachment

accomplished the one thousandth (1000th) actual scramble

were in extremely rough terrain which made their re-

covery next to impossible by any other means.

These

missions were flown all over the State of Arizona.

They cover an area from a few miles next to the Mexican

border to the depths of the Grand Canyon.

This detachment has flown 1020:30 hours in the I1-43B

as of 5 July 1962.

We have found the H-43B requires

relatively little maintenance once it is placed in com-

mission.

There have been times when parts were on

shortage and the aircraft would be AOCP for a short

period of time.

These missions combined with the professional at-

titude of the members of this

Detachment speak for

themselves.

Both the civilian and the military pop-

ulace have grown to depend on the professional ability

ofthis Detachment and its members have tried to meet

the obligation both day and night. The H-43B has played

the largest part in the mission accomplishment.

It has

definitely proven itself to be an

extremely

versatile

vehicle for both fire suppression and rescue. K

Q's A's

If you have a question regarding Kaman Air-

craft maintenance, send it along to Rolor Tips. The

Service Department's analysts will be glad to answer it.

(Applies H-43A, H-43B) ARE

BUBBLES SEEPING FROM THE SURFACE

OF THE FIRE SUPPRESSION KIT AIR TANK

AN INDICATION OF IMMINENT FAILURE?

A.

No, the bubble seepage is due to

normal expansion of the Fiberglas layers

during charging of the tank. The expansion

of the tank is normal. The tank, in the

normal course of use,

comes in contact

with foam and water and the Fiberglas,

being porous,

allows the moisture to pene-

trate.

When the tank is pressurized, ex-

pansion takes place at a greater rate inside

the tank than outside and the moisture

trapped within the Fiberglas is forced to

the surface causing small bubbles to escape,

thus giving the appearance of a leaking tank.

(Applies H-43B) WHAT COULD CAUSE

A HEAVY DOWN LOAD ON THE COLLEC-

TIVE PITCH STICK?

A.

A malfunctioning rudder lock solenoid

valve,

P/N 7-V-7099,

can cause this con-

dition. Both the collective limiter and the

rudder lock utilize oil pressure from the

same stage of the transmission oil pump.

Should the solenoid valve poppet fail to seat

properly, it will allow the oil pressure to

bleed by, thus robbing the collective limiter

of its normal operating pressure and creat-

ing the stick down loads.

The condition is

most likely to occur with the DSAS switch

"ON." To relieve the download, switch the

DSAS "OFF." A future revision to T. O.

1H-43B-2 will include this troubleshooting

information.

KAMAN ROTOR TIPS

Q.

(Applies H-43B) IS THE DOWN STOP

ON THE PILOT'S COLLECTIVE STICK

RIGGED LOWER THAN THE STOP ON THE

CO-PILOT'S STICK?

A.

Yes, the pilot's collective stick down

stop is rigged lower than the stop on the

co-pilot's stick to insure full closing action

of the collective limiter valve in the down

direction.

Centrifugal loads from the blade

control rods and spring loads from the col-

lective limiter cause a twisting action in

the collective torque tubes.

The pilot's

down stop is rigged lower to compensate

for this twisting action and assures positive

pilot control of the collective limiter. Com-

plete collective stop rigging procedures can

be found in the latest issue of T. O. 1H-43B-2.

- W.J.W.

Q.

(Applies HOK-1, HUK-1) WHY IS

THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE ALLOW-

ABLE OVERSPEEDIN THE 1340AN-48 AND

-52 ENGINES?

A.

The difference in allowable overspeed

between the two engines is in relationship

to the blower ratio.

If an engine is driven

to overspeed and the

engine

blower ratio

is high and the compression ratio is the same

for both engines,

the detrimental effect of

poor fuel-air mixture is added to the detri-

ment of the overspeed. The engines are the

same except for the impeller shaft inter-

mediate gear assembly, the impeller shaft

assembly and the carburetor elbow adapter.

This is borne out by the operational differ-

ence in

the manifold pressure. - A.A.W.

Q.

(Applies H-43B) SHOULD WASHERS

OR SHIMS BE USED

is aimed at preventing this from occurring.

The gaps between the right rear engine

mount housing and the bolt head; the 'left

rear housing and the fittings; the right for-

ward rod ends and the housing and fitting;

and the left forward rod end and fitting are

necessary for engine expansion and opera-

(Applies H-43B) IS IT PERMISSABLE

TO MANUFACTURE THE MANUAL CARGO

RELEASE WIRE, P/N K731570-23, LO-

CALLY AND, IF SO, WHAT PRECAUTION

SHOULD BE OBSERVED?

A.

It is permissable to manufacture this
