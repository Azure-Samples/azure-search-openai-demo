It is noted that UNSUB in this matter requested

that the aft door must be opened and the stairs down

during take off. When it was explained to the hijacker

that the plane could not take off with the stairs down, he

reportedly said in a low voice, "Yes they can, but the

cockpit can put it down after they get airborne."

Executive, advised that if the hijacker was a member of or

had consulted with a member of The Boeing test team, he would

have known that the 727 could not have taken off with the

air stairs down; nor would it have been necessary, since the

air stairs can easily be lowered in flight.

On 7/31/72,

advised that all personnel

involved in the Boeing tests

have been interviewed by Boeing

Security Personnel and at the time of interview, copies

of the artist's conception of UNSUB were provided to those

personnel interviewed.

specifically requested

that any further interviews with Boeing personnel be

arranged through him and that consideration be given to

prior contact with Boeing employees because of valuable work

time involved.

on 7/31/72,l

made available, a copy of

the Boeing testssummary report dealing with the flight

configuration of the 727 during testing. The following

is a summary of the configuration used during the Boeing air

stairs test:

Speed - 125 knots

Flaps - 25 degrees down

Altitude - 10,000 feet

The following information was obtained from The

Boeing report:

...the air stard was quite stable when it was

down and no airplane control problems were experienced.

No excessive cabin pressure transients were noted with the

aft entry door open and the stair extended.

alloved it to be sate?

the stair retracted at speeds up to 300 knots.

In Seattle report of SA CHARLES E. FARRELL dated

2/16/72, it is noted that UNSUB requested the following

configuration upon taking off from Seattle-Tacoma (Sea-Tac)

It is apparent therefore, that the configuration

requested by UNSUB is not the same as used in Boeing air

stair testing.

further stated that the Boeing test results

occupy many volumes and because of the many copies made and

length of time since test conducted (8 years), it is not

possible to determine the names of all persons

who might

RE: ARTIST'S CONCEPTION

Enclosed is a copy of photo KK5-1 in the Facial

Lines Section of the Facial Identification Catalogue, and

a copy of the artist's composite of UNSUB.

The Bureau advised by teletype dated 12/17/71

as follows:

"It is expected the Seattle Office will continue

to give this matter close supervisory attention and insure

investigation is conducted promptly and thoroughly."

In view of this, the enclosed information is being

submitted in memorandum form, first for supervisor evaluation

and approval prior to being forwarded to the Bureau for

approval.

A key witness,_

was very

adamant in her insistence that the artist's

conception was

12/221100d Likeness of ede hatacker.

In an FD-302 dated

12/2/71,1

stated that the coneption was not, in

her opinion, a good likeness of the hijacker.

She requested

permission to examine the Facial Identification Catalogue

and immediately picked out photo #KK5-1 in the Facial Lines

Section stating,

"that is him, except for the years and hair."

She explained that the person depicted in that particular

photo closely resembled the man; however, the ears of the

hijacker did not protrude as far from the head and she felt

that the hair line should be somewhat lower than that on the

man depicted on photo

a good likeness of the hijacker.

164-81-31541

A comparison of the artist's composite of UNSUB

and photo KK5-1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man much

younger than theman depicted in photo KK5-1. The man in

K5-1 appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite show

the man in his late 20s or early 30s.

Witness

advised on 11/29/71 that

the artist's composite of UNSUB depicted a man too young.

Witness

advised on 11/29/71

the man depicted in

artist's composite appears younger than

UNSUB actually is.

Stewardess

on 11/25/71 advised the mar

depicted in artist's composite is

"too young.'

From a review of Seattle report of SA CHARLES E.

FARRELL, dated 2/16/72, it is apparent that the only witnesses

to see UNSUB, for any length of time, at a close distance,

were the three Northwest Airlines stewardesses. Therefore,

their opinions should be given more consideration and any

artist's conception of UNSUB should reflect more of their

views than those of the other witnesses.

To date 475 suspects have been developed based on

appearance, as well as other features.

Many of the suspects

were developed because of their resemblance to the artist's

composite of UNSUB. A great number of these suspects have

turned out to be in their 20s or early 30s, with light or

fair complexion.

According to witnesses, UNSUB's age is in

the mid-40s and his complexion is olive or latin in appearance.

The artist's composite clearly looks like a man in his late

20s or 30s and his complexion is difficult to determine

from the black and white sketch.

Many agent hours are necessary to eliminate a

suspect once developed.

To investigate a suspect who

should never have been considered is inefficient as well as

ineffective. Redoing the artist's composite to better

approximate the age and complexion of UNSUB should save

many fruitless hours of agent investigation time.

In view of the above the following lead is

suggested:

A Bureau artist should recontact the three Northwest

Airlines stewardesses and amend the current composite to better

reflect his age and complexion. The sketch should be done in

chance hashing the he yach ask at and Bidea

in a standing position. All sketches should be in color to

indicate UNSUB's swarthy complexion.

The FBI Laboratory should ovide Information to

the Bureau artist as to color of hair based upon a single

nair sample submitted previously by the Las Vegas Division.

it is noted that this hair was found on the head rest towe

on the back of the seat reportedly occupied by UNSUB.

It is further noted that this hair is being held by the

Las Vegas Division as evidence.

If the exact color of the

hair was not determined in the

initial Laboratory

examination, the Las Vegas Division should be directed

to forward it to the Laboratory for a color examination.

RE: ARTIST'S CONCEPTION

Enclosed is a copy of photo KK5-1 in the Facial

Lines Section of the Facial Identification Catalogue, and a

copy of the artist's composite of UNSub.

The following information is being submitted for

Bureau review, and the enclosed leads are being set forth

on an UACB basis:

On 12/2/71, a key witness,

insisted that the artist's conception was not a good likeness

of the hijacker.

She requested parmission to examine the

Facial Identification Catalogue and immediately picked out

photograph Kk5-1 in the Facial lines Section stating, "that

is him, except for the ears and hair." She explained that the

person depicted in that particular photograph resembled

the man; however, the ears of the hijacker did not protrude

as far from the head and she felt that the hair line should

be somewhat lower than that on the man depicted on photo

KK5-1.

She was very adamant in her insistence that the

artist's conception shown to her was not a good ilkeness

of the hijackex.

A comparison of the artist's composite of UNSUB

and photo KK5-1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man much

younger than the man depicted in photo KK5-1. The man In

KK5-1 appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite shows

the man in his late 20s or early 30g.

In addition, the following witnesses indicated

their dissatisfaction with the artist's sketch:

Witness

the artist's composite of insul depicted a man too young.

advised on 12/29/71,

it a depicted in artists composit and you than

UNSUB actually is. Stewardess

on 11/25/71,

advised the man depicted in artist's composite is "too young."

To date 475 suspects have been devaloped based on

appearance, as woll as other features. Many of the suspocts

were developed because of their resemblance to the artist's

composite of UNSUB. A great nunber of these suspects have

turned out to be in their 20s or early 30s, with light or

fair complexion.

According to witnesses, UNSUB's age 13 in

the mid*40s and his complexion is olive or latin in appearance.

The artist's composite clearly looks Ilke a man in his late

20s or early 305 and his complexion is difficult to determine

from the black and white sketch.

Many agent hours are necessary to eliminate a

suspect once developed.

Redoing the artist's composite

• to

botter approximate the age and complexion of UNSUB should

save many fruitlass hours of agent investigation time.

From a review of Seattle ropdit of SA CilARLES B.

FARRELI dated 2/16/72, it is apparent that the only witnesses

to see UNSUB for any length of time, at a close distance,

were the three Northwest Airlines stewardesses. Therefore,

their opinions should be given more consideration and any

artist's conception of UNSUB should roflect more of their

vows than those of the other witnesses.

In view of the above the following lead is

being set forth on an VACB basia:

Airlines stewardesses and amend the current composite to better

reflect his age and complexion. The sketch should be done In

color showing fall face, full face with dark glasses, sire

profile and a sketch showing the hijackers height and build

In a standing position. All sketches should be in color to

13 RE

indicate UNSUB's swarthy conplexion.

The FBI Laboratory will provide information to

the sureau artist as to color of hair based upon a single

hair sample submitted previously by the Las vegas Division.

It is noted that this hair was found on the head rest towel

on the back of the seat reportedly occupied by UNSUB.

It is further noted that this hair is being held by the

Las Vegas Division as evidence,

If the exact color of the

hair was not determined in the initial Laboratory

exanination, the Las Vegas Division should be directed

to forward it to tha Laboratory fox a color exanination.

The Seattle Division will, upon receipt of coples

of the amended sketch, supervise its distribution.

Re memo of SA

Ito SAC, 8/4/72

On 8/7/72 the agents attached to Longview RA donducted

a check of the area mentioned in referenced memorandum which

also had a map attached. SAL

_conducted a

complete through search of the area starting at County Road

20 and progressing through the area to county road 32. It is

felt a thorough walk through search was conducted of the

suspect area and it was noted that the area is extremely

heavy brush,

fallen timber and almost inpenetrable and is

an area

in which there are no residences or farm buildings.

On the County Road 32 side of the suspect area the terrain

drops very sharply about 50 feet from the road to the creek

bed. Further on the county road 20 side of the suspect area

the terrain also drops very sharply to the creek.

It is felt that if a decision should be made to conduct

turther searching of the suspect area it would be necessary

to have lo agents for a period of two days. The property in

question is privately owned with three parcels owned by three

individuals.

In order that this case be given more publicity,

the following leads are being set forth for Bureau

consideration and approval:

I. Mats should be made of the artist's conception

of Unsub so that small publications with limited

funds can feature articles concerning this matter

and include with the story a picture of Unsub

without incurring the additonal expense of having

new mats made (Note: ' An editor of the Veterans'

of Foreign Wars publication for the State of

Oregon has

requested such a mat to print a

picture of Unsub in his next issue).

2. If the artist's

conception of unsub is changec

as suggested in referended airtel, mats of the

new picture should also be made.

Bureau artist developed composite drawing of NORJAK Unsub

with sunglasses based on interviews with stewardesses

and

On 11/27/71 stewardess

while viewing original

sketch prepared,

commented that it was "almost 100% like him" and stated

she could suggest nothing additional to make sketch a better likeness.

With reference to photo KK5-1 in the Bureau's Facial Identifica-

tion Catalog, it is noted

indicated on her initial interview it would

bear a resemblance to Unsub if modifications were made. She selected ten

) additional photos as resembling various features of Unsub. This plus the

comments and look-alike photos selected by stewardesses

went into the preparation of composite drawing with sunglasses.

The sketch was modified to show the eyes when additional witnesses later

selected look-alike photos of the eyes.

The attempt to depict the apparent age of Unsub has proven

difficult from the beginning since witnesses did not describe age lines or

features that lend themselves to the aging process. Preparation of the

drawing in color may contribute to the aging factor as well as show the

complexion color. In view ofL

more recent comments, an

additional sketch in color and labeled "B" has been prepared by Exhibits

Section with and without sunglasses. The "B" sketch is based on photo

came to Chicago one year ago. While in Seattle he sport

parachuted for six years. He stated he did not recall

having met anyone he felt could be identical to unknown

subject.

stated in his opindon the person responsible

for the hijacking is not a sport parachutist.

He bases

this opinion on the theory that sport parachutists have

an emotional attachment to their equipment, and probably

would not perform a jump with equipment not known to them.

From the accounts

he read concerning the hijacking he

assumes the hijacker had military parachuting experience.

DETAILS:

PREDICATION

RICHARD FLOYD MC COY, JR. - SUSPECT

MC COY was the subject of a similar crime aboard

aircraft - hijacking case involving United Air Lines Flight

855 From Denver, Colorado, to Los Angeles, Californi jury

April 7, 1972,

in which case MC COY was convicted by

in United States District Court, Salt Lake City, Utah, and

sentenced on July 10, 1972, to a term of 45 years.

This investigation was predicated on the fact that

numerous similarities

exist between the captioned matter,

"NORJAK," and the case involving MC COY, as follows:

In NORJAK, envelope containing instructions was

furnished to stewardess.

In United Air Lines, envelope and

two-page single spaced, typewritten instructions with envelope

containing hand grenade safety pin and 45 caliber cartridge

were given to stewardess.

The subject in NORJAK exhibited contents of attache

case are

case arleged to contain dynamite.

In United Air Lines case,

hijacker exhibited gun and grenade and indicated he had

plastic explosive.

In NORJAK case, subject dictated message to stewardess

as follows:

"I want $200,000 by 5:00 p.m. in cash.

Put it in

a knapsack.

I want

two back parachutes and two front parachutes.

When we land, I want a

fuel truck read to refuel. No funny

stuff, or I'Il do the job."

In United Airlines case,

specific typewritten in-

structions were given for United Air Lines to have $500,000

in various

denominations, two back and two front parachutes

of a specific manufacture and location where they could be

obtained at San Francisco, that fuel truck with six hours

fuel and two men on truck be available; that all vehicles be

100 feet from the nose of the aircraft on the left side, and

that captain of hijacked plane use Runway 19 Left at San

Francisco International Airport.

In NORJAK, passengers were deplaned and one

stewardess and three male flight crew members remained on

board. In United Air Lines case, all passengers deplaned,

Unite As

two, stewardess and three flight crew personnel remained on

board.

In NORJAK, hijacker instructed he be flown to Mexico

City, instructing pilot to fly at not more than 10,000 feet,

with flaps at 15 degrees, the landing gear down and rear steps

of plane

also down, plane involved being Boeing 727,

a tri-jet,

with stairs at rear.

Hijacker finally agreed to having steps

raised.

(It

is noted Boeing

727 aircraft unable to take off

with stairs in lowered position. However in order for stairs

to be lowered in flight, it is necessary that rear pressured

door be in open position on take-off.)

Continuing in NORJAK, stewardess remained in cabin

with hijacker, and hijacker had stewardess show him how to

lower steps and ordered her to go to first class section.

United Air Lines hijacker ordered stewardess to go to front

section of plane and did not require instructions as to how

to operate lowering mechanism of rear stairs.

In NORJAK, plane captain was in contact with hijacker

by intercom and just prior to final communication with hijacker,

captain had signal indicating stairs had been lowered.

In United Air Lines case; plane crew was on oxygen

flying at 16,000 feet for a period of one and one-half hours

prior to hijacker jumping due to open rear stairs.

In NORJAK, Boeing 727 was flying at 170 knots. In

United Air Lines case, Boeing 727 was flying at 180 knots,

which approximates 200 miles per hour or 3 miles per minute,

at instruction of hijacker.

In NORJAK, two parachutes remained on aircraft

when it arrived at Reno, Nevada, one of which was open and

three shroud lines had been cut

and removed from parachute,

presumably to tie ransom money package to hijacker.

United Air Lines case, hijacker jettisoned one, two or three

parachutes in Nevada,

at least one containing homing device,

and had rope or harness in his possession to fasten money and

equipment to him. In United Air Lines case, the rope was 19

feet long with eye grommets.

In interview of local National

Guard

parachute jumper, he indicated it is standard operating

procedure in National Guard units to have "H" harness with

=.

which equipment package is strapped to body: Approximately

25 foot rope is fastened to harness and equipment package,

and after parachute is opened, jumper lowers package so it

dangles below him. As jumper approaches ground, he releases

rope from body harness

with result package will

drop in

immediate area of landing.

Jumper cannot retain package

fastened to body as this would hinder landing operation and

possibly cause serious injury.

Physical description in both cases is remarkably

similar.

In mid 40s, and personal observation of Me COl, age 29, gives

immediate impression of man possibly 40. Composit photograph

Of NORJAK subject bears strong resemblance, particularly hair-

line, hair part, shape of face and nose. In NORJAK case,

123,24

witnesses describe subject's complexion as olive, Latir

appearance, medium smooth. In United Air Lines case, Witnesses

Likewise described subject as of dark complexion, osbilly

Mexican, believed due to make-up. In NORJAK case,

described as having sideburns at

low ear level.

Subject in

United Air Lines case upon arrest had sideburns to bottom

lobe of ear. In NORJAK case, witnesses stated voice had no

particular accent, possibly from Midwest section of United

States.

In United Air Lines case, witnesses described

subject's voice as

normal and did

I not refer to any accent of

апу type.

In

NORJAK case, subject described as heavy smoker

of Raleigh filter-tip cigarettes.

In United Air Lines Case,

subject brought supply of candy and continually ate

during flight..

candy

It is noted

United Air Lines investigation

has not indicated United Air Lines subject smökes; however,

from Raleight, North Carolina.

Candy could

substitute for cigarettes; however, subject in each case

obviously nervous.

SU 164-24

In United Air Lines case, there is obvious

evidence subject attempted to disguise himself after boarding

plane, in that he on two occasions spent extended periods in

lavatory and emerged with black hair wig and false mustache.

In NORJAK case, subject during latter part of flight

put on dark wrap-around sunglasses with dark rims. United Air

Lines case subject boarded plane with mirror type sunglasses.

In United Air Lines case, subject departed plane shortly after

heading east of Utah Lake near airport with beacon and immediately

beyond, farm land thus providing excellent bearings for jump.

In NORJAK case, subject was very insistent upon

retrieving instructions after reading by pilot.

In United Air

Lines case, subject likewise insisted upon retrieving

instructions.

Advance preparation of flight plan instructions

in United Air Lines case could logically represent refinement

of modus operandi.

11:00pm to 7:00am.

He stated that in view of the fact

November 25, 1971, was a holiday, he did not personally

work that day and as a result,

the machine date of November

25, would not have been changed to November 21, 1911, until

9: Can on November 20, when he visited the station to

correlate the receipts for the holiday.

further noted that in all possibility,

the employee handling

the actual transaction was on duty

from 11:00pm, November 25, to 7:00am, November 26, and

therefore entered the date as November 26, which would have

been his regular work day and the machine date would not

have been changed until his appearance later as noted above.

To date the Bureau

For the information of the Seattle Office,

an

Many

The Seattle Office should promptly coordinate

evaluation. If it is deemed advisable that the mats

He produced a United States Department of Agriculture,

The building being approximately

the contents of the duffel bag and discovered that it contained

rifle bullets, long-handled men's underwear, shoe grease, candles,

a jacket, vitamin pills, ahd some hippie-type smoking pipes,

which appeared to handmade.

He noticed no food, no socks, or

shoes in the bag.

He noted that several of these items still

had price tags on them reflecting that they were purchased

either at GI Joe's or Andy and Box both of which are Army sur-

plus stores located

in Portland, Oregon, He did not recall any

dates of purchase.

He also noted that there was a left-handed bow, as

used by archers, hanging from a tree nearby. He removed

this

bow and took it with him, the bow bears the

name Baer Archery

Company, Grayling, Michigan, registration number|

He stated that the area of the cache is located in

what is known as Hell's Canyon, near the boundary between east-

ern Oregon and Idaho. It is located generally in a gully be-

tween Windy Ridge and the next ridge located to the southwest.

He states that

the nearest community is in Imnaha, Oregon,

located on the Imnaha River. To get to the area

you take the

He stated that this general area has the appearance

is a camping area which might be an overnight stopping point

on these packtrain trips.

He stated that from this camping

area the site of the cache is perhaps 100 to 150 yards away

up the side of a hill in heavy brush. The cache could not be

seen from the camping area but the area could probably be point-

ed out by one of the rangers from the nearby ranger station at

states that no one was with him when he found the cache
