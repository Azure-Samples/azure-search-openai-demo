noted that the vehicle identification number was recorded

SKULL NOT LIKELY

TO BE HIJACKER'S

OREGON CITY, Ore. UP—A weathered human skult

found in the Mit. Hood National Forest has been examined

to see if it could belong to a skydiving hijacker known as

D. B. Cooper. But authorities said it probably was not.

Cooper's.

Dr. Larry Lewman, deputy Oregon medical examiner,;

said Saturday that the skull appeared to be that of a

white male in his 30s. Cooper was believed to be in his

late 40s or early 50s.

The FBI said the flight pattern and winds the night of

the hijacking more than three years ago also made it im-

probable that the skull could be that of the skyjacker.

A man using the name of D. B. Cooper hijacked a North-

west Airlines jet Thanksgiving eve, 1971, and parachuted

out with $200,000 in ransom. He was never found and the

money was never recovered.

It Cooper survived the jump, he is the only domestic hi-

jacker who has not been captured or killed. The statute of

limitations will run out on the crime in two years.

The skull was found east of Estacada Thursday by a

hiker and turned over to the Clackamas County sheriff's

department.

The idea that the skull could belong to Cooper spread

When the man who found the skull reported seeing a pa-

rachute in a nearby tree.

A sheriff's deputy confirmed that there was a parachutel

lin the tree, but he said authorities had been aware of the

chute for some time and that it appeared to be from

weather instruments.

"I think this will turn out to be one our lost hunters, and

h could be from out of state," the deputy said.

"We may

have a

whale of a time finding out who he is, if we ever

do."

If so, at what hour and date will it be

What will be the eifect of it? Will he

be free from arrest and prosecution?

Also, will the $200,000 become his,

to spend freely and without further attempts

of recovery by Federal, airline, bank or

Am I correct that under a Minnesota

If so, why

just $180,000? And, what was/is the

At the effective moment of the Statute

of Limitations will your office and the FBi

both 'close' the case?

Fully, or in what

respects?

I understand that in seeking leads on the

$200,000 your office, or FBI, circulated 34

pages of ransom note

bill numbers. Have any

It is felt that several organizations night be interested

'Malabar VII'

may be getaway boat

At a waterfront bar in Papeete, Tahiti, I heard one of the,

most bizarre sea stories of our time.

Would you believe that D. B. Cooper, who bailed out of a

Western Airlines plane five years ago with a fortune in cashi

may be cruising the world's oceans aboard John Alden's

'"Malabar VII" from Dolphin Marina?

"It's our favorite fantasy," yacht broker Dan Streech of

Dana Point said, explaining how "Malabar VII," which left

Marina del Rey in 1970, may be involved in the still-unsolved

mystery ot Cooper's successful heist.

BACK PACKING IN FRENCH POLYNESIA

Dan was on his way to the Tahiti airport after three weeks

"III," hiking days and sleeping nights on the beaches. He said!

understand if you do that, the mosquitos aren't interested

Anyway. I only got one or two bites a day.'

He spent about $300 in three weeks (plus $750 round-trip

air fare from Los Angeles) and most of the places where he

camped were near native huts "and the Tahitians brought me

food." He recalled buying "mostly bread, with lots of peanut

butter and jelly."

In his back pack: a sleeping bag, a bedsheet, swim fins and

mask, Sterno and freeze-dried food, one pair of long pants,

one pair of cut-offs, a swim suit "and three or four shirts."

On Bora Bora, Dan spent two days reading a ship's log kept

by Hans Fleish "at the Oa Oa, or perhaps you spell it Oahoa)

Hotel. Hans caters to visiting yachts and has free hot showers

for boating people. Then he asks them to write about their

voyages in his log. Some people even draw pictures. I couldn't

stop reading about their experiences!"

A night at that hotel, with meals, is "about $20," Dan

ecalled. That's unusually reasonable in the outer islands

where a room or bungalow may run as high as $9S a night and

the average is about $50 with two meals.

Re Seattle airtel to Bureau, 5/12/76.

There are no newspapers, magazines or similar

publications located within the Los Angeles Division that

captioned case.

Prior contact with media outlets regarding

similar requests as set forth in referenced airtel has

determined that before a

media outlet will even consider

printing a volume of serial numbers, the matter must be of

current,

constant highlight news interest (such as the first

case) and must have a constant, meaningful local interest

to the readership.

tion I had at that time.

She explained that the agent who

handled the case was not on duty but that he would call on

me at my home.

I now have more complete information and

would like to dispose of the matter.

Because the Bureau seemed very busy, I wonder if I could

be of assistance in a volunteer capacity. My experience

and training has run along the lines of police work, as

has yours, axcept that I have not risen to Chief as

I am in good health, t6 years old, a native of Calif.

In 1940 I successfully passed the L.A.P.D. Policeworran

examination but did not get an appointment as only 10 were

selected and I was number 30 at the time of the examination.

However, I have done work in that line and also as a store

operative -- mostly at Christmas time. I have also worked

in the City Schools, a University, as

a Church Secretazy

and can nake myself useful around an office.

May I hear from you?
