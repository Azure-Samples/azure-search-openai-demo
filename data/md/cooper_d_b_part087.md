A production of THE D.B. COOPER PROJECT was part of The Cricket Theatre's Works-In-Progress Series 1977-78.

The Playwright

The former Producing Director of Boston's Calliope Theatre, John Orlock came

to Minneapolis in 1975 after two years on the faculty of the Department of Theatre

and Film at Pennsylvania State University, where he was a member of their

professional acting program. Currently, he teaches acting at the College of St.

Thomas as well as at The Theatre Studio in Minneapolis. He is also a working

Resident Playwright with the Playwrights Lab, and in that capacity has

conducted a number of writing workshops both locally and at colleges

throughout the country. Mr. Orlock's work as a playwright has been published by

Baker's Plays, with productions Off-Oft-Broadway and at major regional

theatres. INDULGENCES IN THE LOUISVILLE HAREM, which received its Area

Premiere at the Cricket Theatre last season, will be produced by the Oregon

Shakespeare Festival this summer. His play about baton twirling, THE FLEECE,

toured throughout England in spring of last year. THE D.B. COOPER PROJECT

is his first musical. In August, 1979, Mr. Orlock will assume his duties as the new

Literary Manager for The Cricket Theatre.

Smoking permitted in the lobby only. No food, drink or cameras are permitted in the theatre. Latecomers will be seated in their appropriate seats

only at scene breaks at the discretion of the management.

FRED THOMPSON (Ben) is making his third appearance at The Cricket Theatre.

Last season he was seen as Johnny Meeghan in THE TRIP BACK DOWN and as

HER EAR at Miami's Coconut Grove Playhouse and Geoffrey at Atlanta's

Alliance Theatre's production of ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR. Mr. Thompson

spent five seasons at Michigan's Meadow Brook Theatre where he played

everything from Shakespeare to Shaffer.

The Producing Director

Upon returning from his discovery of the headwaters of the Lualaba at age 16 Bill

Semans decided firmly on a career in the fabulous arc-welding field. This passion

existed until he also discovered that precious few arcs are being contructed

these days, much less welded. From there, of course, it was an easy transition

into theatre where many things are welded it you have the equipment which is

often expensive unless one steals it. Bill is a graduate of the Bide-A-Wee Day

school, Paticoat Tech and the Madame Hoernbecker School of Knowledge from

whence he obtained an M.A. in Nocturnal Wombat Viewing with oak leaf cluster.

During his bachelor days he could often be spotted scattering seeds and leading

an all-girl aphid choir in Stravinsky's Le Sacre Du Aphid Printemps with cicada

backup on percussion. Hobbies? Everyone has hobbies. Bill tends to dress and

clean up before work and prefers a light perfume during daylight hours and

camisoles of Spanish voille or vole replete with string tie, jodphurs and ormolu

tiara. Contrary to popular legend Bill did not start The Cricket. In point of fact, he

was driving between Joplin, Mo. and the Natchez Trace at the precise moment of

The Cricket's founding by Welander Quist as a NE auxiliary to his far-flung

empire which bears only a nodding acquaintance with Land-O-Nod. His

hobbies? Of course, Bill's wife Gloriana and his two sons, Rark and Pudif reside

in a comely nest of branches and twigs gaily festooned with bits of pastel yarn

produced on the shores of Sturgeon Lake by itinerant weavers who later formed a

singing group by a different name. Having become a legend, Bill has this to say

about his future: "Bleak." Others, asked to comment on that subject have all

responded with "bleak" making a unified chorus of praise and hope for this

nearly 7 ft. gaunt man who can and will play the heron in your next production of

TIME OUT FOR GINGER UP IN MABEL'S ROOM MURDER or THE LIFE OF

DON STOLZ. Any questions regarding Bill or the myriad small lice nesting in his

beard should be referred to H.V. Kaltenborn, NBC Red Network, Little Ossipee,

N.H. Those who send 5c or 10¢ (whichever is larger) will receive a copy of this

suitable for hanging from some part of your anatomy to be selected by our panel.

The Choreographer

John Command is a highly experienced dancer and choreographer. He has

appeared in and/or choreographed twenty-six shows at the Chanhassen Dinner

Theatre complex from their first show in 1968, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINES

WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, to their current production of CAMELOT. Most

recently, Mr. Command choreographed THE GARFIELD NUDE for Chimera

Theatre. In addition, he teaches at Minnesota Dance Theatre and Nova Dance

Center in Burnsville and is the choreographer for Minneapolis' Edgewater 8. A

man of many interests, Mr. Command also runs The City Lakes Daily and sells

real estate with Burnet Realty. During spare moments he indulges in bridge and

walking his dogs, Buster and Missy.

The Music Director/Arranger

Jimmie Martin is a noted pianist and composer and has been musical director for

such musicals as THE FANTASTIKS, THE FLOWER DRUM SONG and MY FAIR

LADY. Recently, his work was seen in Chanhassen's production of OH!

COWARD and at The Cricket Theatre where he was musical director for this

season's production of MOURNING PICTURES. Also an actor/singer, Mr. Martin

has portrayed Herman in MOST HAPPY FELLA and has played numerous leads

in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. His wide ranging interests include writing

commercials, composing music for industrial films, arranging music for special

programs in the Twin Cities, horseback riding, and crocheting and embroidering

for his family. Mr. Martin majored in music education, piano and organ at the

University of Michigan. (continued)

The Artistic Director

F. Lou Salerni arrived at the doorstep of The Cricket Theatre in 1977 straight from

the pages of Who's Who in the West. In his many faceted career he has written

several plays, won three acting awards, a special award for playwrighting and

one for directing plus the Schubert Playwrighting Fellowship. Lou has an

extensive background in teaching and directing: The Banff School of Fine Arts,

The University of Oregon, Kansas State Teachers College and Rhodesia, where

he spent 1973 as national guest-artist-in residence, being accused of the year-

long draught and labeled "the controversial Lou Salerni."

He also possesses the single claim to fame that while shooting a scene in the film

SASQUATCH he was attacked by an 800 pound grizzly bear who misunderstood

the director's "cut" cue to mean "eat the skinny Italian."

Having directed over a dozen productions for The Cricket Theatre including

ARTICHOKE, THE LAST MEETING OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE WHITE

MAGNOLIA, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, STREAMERS, A BREEZE

FROM THE GULF and THE D.B. COOPER PROJECT, he has been labeled "the

best director in the Twin Cities", "a genius" and "the perfect director."

He continually perseveres in his never-ending quest to find a good Italian

restaurant in the Twin Cities, to stay on top of his house remodeling projects

keep his fingers out of Cuisinart blades, and direct plays of merit.

He's earned the respect and admiration of actors and playwrights across the

country and gives The Cricket the artistic vision and focus that makes it one o

the most vital theatres in the country

Dear

First, let me assure you: I am D,B, Cooper, the individual who

completed the skyjacking in 1969. Of course, you -- and any of

your colleagues may choose to disbelieve this: our society is

comprised of individuals who, strangely enough, believe in that

• ,

which is untrue, disbelieve in that which is fact.

Nevertheless; I have decided that it is time for a bit of communica-

tion. Somewhat rather smugly observing the minor fanfare my ten-

anniversary caused in the media this November, I suadenly

realized that I wanted people to know I was still alive - and

that I had, in fact, successfully eluded the police and lived -:

very nicely,. I might add -- on the proceeds of my adventure.

I moved to Atlanta more than five years ago and began watching

your newscasts. You seemed to have a "no-nonsense" approach to

the news which

I can appreciate " and thus, when I finally decided

to communicate w/ the outside world, you appeared the natural choice.

I'd like to clear up two items concerning my little event. First,

I did it for the sheer sake of adventure, nothing more. And this

adventure was both a mental & physical challange - which leads

me to my

While I shall not

detail the incident -- at least not now - I will say that it was

will feel a bit foolish. And I even left a bit 'of a clue, which

still remains in the area: I was back there this past summer.

you have a wonderful city and I have enjoyed my

stay. I own a house in the city and am delighted with the many

cultural opportunities here, Indeed, I hope to remain in Atlanta

for at least a few more years.

Again, whether or not you believe this is "the real thing" does

not concern me. I am very much aware that it is & simply wished
