RE: REMNANTS OF A PARACHUTE HARNESS FOUND IN

SKAMANIA COUNTY

The remnants of a parachute harness, located by

the Sheriff's Office in Skamania County, were inspected on

5-31-72 by EARL J. COSSEY who advised that they are remnants

of a parachute harness but positively are not part of any

of the four he packed and which were used in the hijack

situation.

His elimination was based on the fact that the

straps

are olive drab whereas the missing chute is sage

green in color.

one of the remnants has a piece

sewn to it to extend its

Further length, plus the fact that part

of the remnants found was a Capewell quick-release which

the missing chute does not have.

Re: Bureau airtel to Seattle, 5/17/72.

Pursuant to instructions contained in referenced

airtel, an extensive file review of captioned case was

conducted by the writers from May 22 - 26, 1972. Among

files reviewed were main volumes, numbers

subfiles

designated for a particular area of interest, i.e. parachutes,

Witnesses, course; I-A volumes and numerous suspect sub-

files.

In addition, physical

evidence as available was

reviewed for pertinent investigative leads.

Information set forth following the fle review

has been

arranged according to the headings used in the

table of contents fund in the report of SA CHARLES E.

FARRELL, dated February 16, 1972, with the exception of

a brief

hijacker profile.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

Black Snap-On Tie and

Tie Tack

An examination of the tie by the writers revealed

noticeable amounts of dust lodged in the inner knot area.

In addition to the markings "3 Penneys", two other labels

were found as follows:

"Snapper Pat. 2972750.

It's a snap

to snap on"; 'and "100% Dacron Polyester Washable RN 16484".

From writers' experience in Theft From Interstate Shipment

cases involving Penneys merchandise, it is known that the

RN number is a manufacturer's code.

Penneys headquarters

will be able to determine where the tie was manufactured,

when imported and which stores sold this tie.

It is recommended that the las be requested to

in the inner knot area, to determine if it is possible to

It is recommended that a lead be set out for New

York to contact

distribution of neck tie number RN 16484, ie, which Penney

Magazine and

Notebook Paper

Northwest Airlirs, in a

search conducted November 25,

1972, of victim airplane,

found parts of a magazine and a piece of notebook paper

with printing thereon made by a felt marking pa.

Bureau has examined these papers and has found 24 latent

fingerprints and 5 latent palm prints of value.

recommended that since both

witnesses

Jobserved

the unsus write with a felt pen, the notebook paper and

magazine parts printing be shown to these witnesses. This

should be done to determine if the printing is similar to

unsub's and if the felt pen color and characteristics are

similar to unsub's.

ARTIST'S SKETCH

A review of the testimony of the principal

witnesses, including the 3 stewardesses, the 2 Northwest

Airline employees (NWA) at Portland, Oregon, and the 5

passengers reflects a general disagreement concerning the

accuracy of the artist's sketch. Numous changes were sug-

gested by these witnesses and some were implimented in

making up the final artist's sketch.

It is noted that a

Bureau artist personally interviewed the three stewardesses

Minnesota and thereafter prepared a re-

atsed seetch of the hajacker showing him with the dark glasses,

which he wore on the airplane, and another sketch, but

without the glasses.

One key

witness, l

stewardess,

was very adament in her insistence that the

artist's conception was not a very good likeness of the

hijacker.

until an artist's sketch which is agreeable to the majority

of the witnesses can be obtained.

It is recommended that the Color Selection Guide

be used to provide details and depth not ordinarily shown

in black and white sketches.

It is recommended that the Bureau artist sketch

full face with dark glasses,

All the sketches should be in color.

In addition to the facial identification guide,

the Bureau artist and

assist him in preparing the sketch:

Vegas Division,

presumably used by the unsub.

The following photographs of "strong suspects"

which withesses have commented about as having the correct

ears, etc., should be included:

irior to sending the bureau artist to the various

divisions, it is recommended that a letter of appreciation

from the Bureau be sent to all pertinent witnesses, ex-

pressing Bureau appreciation for their time and effort and

indicating desires regarding artist's sketch.

Following the obtaining of an acceptable color

artist's sketch, widespread use of these should be made in

the following ways:

Consideration should be given for another

general mailing of new sketches to all law enforcement

agencies, banks, etc, that

received the old sketches in

previous mailings.

Television and newspaper sources should be

recontacted and brought up to date with the new sketches.

These sketches, additional news releases, copies of

ransom lists as prepared by the Crime Records Division,

should

be provided to all television and newspaper sources.

Space for a color insert in at least one of the major news-

papers having daily circulation in Seattle, Portland, Las

San Francisco and Los Angeles should be purchased.

"nis insert should contain material prepared by the Crime

Records Division and include all four new artist's sketches,

pertinent background information and other interesting news-

worthy developments, in order to promote widespread public

interest resulting in new suspects and possible recovery of

some of the ransom money. It is noted that expenses for a

newspaper format for ransom lists and accompanying back-

ground information were estimated at actual costs of $1,600

for the Seattle Times, Seattle, Washington.

color would,

undoubtedly, cost more.

Bureau Exhibits Section may be able

to cut costs considerably by preparing all material uniformly

prior to submission to major newspapers.

As a source of continuing value, it is recommended

that display or window space be rented for a period of

not less than six months at major airports in Seattle,

Portland, Los Angeles,

San Francisco and Las Vegas, and

that the Exhibits Section prepare hijacking displays,

including artist's sketches, photograph models, ransom

lists, notices of rewards, etc. It is hoped that this

promote a sense of awareness and develop additional

suspects.

In view of the fact that this display may be

done in such a way as to promote airline security and

prevent, or discourage future hijackings, major airlines

may wish to share a portion of the expenses.

that traffic at the above major airports would have a

heightened awareness of hijackings and would, be cognizant

'of the hijacking problem.

EXPERIMENT WITH AIR STAIRS

has suggested

that the hijacker could be someone that worked on the Boeing

engineers worked on it. He only recalls the following:

DESCRIPTIVE DATA

MAICHBOOK COVER

Regarding the blue matchbook cover marked "Sky Chef"

observed by Stewardessl

Jas used by the hi-

jacker, it should be noted that Sky Chef is a chain of

restaurants serving airports.

It is recommended that

Portland determine if there is a Sky Chef Restaurant at the

Portland Airport (noting that the Sky Chef Restaurants usually

have different names)

and Portland should determine if this

restaurant gives away blue colored matchbooks with Sky

Chef written on them.

Unsub may have eaten lunch at the

Portland Airport Restaurant prior to boarding Northwest

Airlines flight 305 and if so, latent fingerprints may be

on a meal ticket (bill) for that day. Portland should

determine if these tickets are available for November 24,

1971, and determine

feasibility of obtaining latents.

OLIVE OR LATIN COMPLEXION•

Key witnesses generally agree that unsub had an

"olive or Latin" complexion. One witness indicated a

Mexican-American or possibly Indian complexion and

characteristics.

In addition, unsub expressed a desire to

go "anywhere in Mexico".

It is recommended that all divisions having a

concentration of Mexican-American extremists, including

Chicanos, Brown Berets, review extremists albums. It is

further suggested that revised colored sketches, when

obtained, be shown to all pertinent Mexican-American sources.

INTERVIEWS WITH KEY WITNESSES

In view of her willingness to cooperate and

ability te recall

explicit details, it is recommended that

## Page 179

SE 164-81

How did the hijacker secure the money? Did

he apper to be going to jump while holding the money

package by a handle or did he fix a knapsack arrangement:

?. What was the position of the hijacker when

last saw him as she left the rear of the

airplane for the last

: time?

What did the hijacker

have around his waist?

Was the hijacker attempting to

, secure himself to the plane by using parachute cords in an

attempt to prevent being pulled out of the airplane when

opening the rear door? Did the hijacker express a rear

to the stewardess that he would be pulled out of the door

prematurely?

Experienced parachutists have advised that attempts

to hold the money without adequately securing it would

probably not be sufficient. Attempts by unsub to secure

himself to the plane prior to openine ght rear door or the

aircraft would indicate a fear of being sucked out of the

aircraft as the stewardess feared.

This would indicate

a lack of knowledge about the Boeing 727 and aircraft in

general.

What was the level of education of the hijacker

as measured in terms of speech, grammar, and mannerisms?

It is recommended that sources in Washington and

Oregon be contacted concerning the sale or theft of that

amount and description of dynamite in a time period of

utilities using dynamite, hardware stores and police

departments and sheriff's offices concerning reports of

theft of dynamite.

HIJACKER PROFILE

Hijacker's clothes may have been unfashionable,

since he was wearing a black thin (out of style) snap-on

tie and tie clasp. Hijacker's briefcase was described as

"cheap" style.

Hijacker's language usage indicates at least a

moderate level of education (high school or higher).

Hijacker drinks bourbon and 7-Up, and smokes

Raleigh cigarettes.

Hijacker did not appear to be an experienced

professional criminal (reportedly his behavior became

childish following receipt of money.) The hijacker was

familiar with the Seattle area because of seveal comments

he made, such as

"we are over Tacoma now" and "McChord

Air Force Base is only 20 minutes from SeaTac Airport."

Hijacker did not provide instructions to control

air speed, nor to control the direction by degree of air-

craft and, therefore, would "inot have been able to control

pickup pon a comes could eliminate theories involving a

hijacker degan immediately attempting to prepare

for jump shortly after lift off at salac Airport.

Because

the money was not in a knapsack and ready for jumping and

because of problems encountered in opening rear door, hi-

jacker may have been delayed in making jump. It is possible

that the hijacker wished to jump much nearer Seattle or

Tacoma.

DB Cooper-857

## Page 181

SE 164-81

Hijacker was probably not a sporting parachutist

as he relied completely on airline personnel to furnish

any type of parachute equipment available.

As a result, he

was furnished a chute that would open quickly with a good

possibility of tearing,, a high rate of descent and non-

steerable. One chute he jumped with was a dummy chute and

would not open.

A parachutist with considerable exper-

ience would have been more specific in the type chutes

requested.

Above suggestions have been set forth in hopes

that investigative efforts of this important major case

might be implemented and case brought to an early logical

conclusion.

The unsub, as Dan Cooper, at 2 p.I., PST,

11/2x/71, purchased a one-way coach ticket at

the Portland

National

Airport, Portland, Oregon, for travel from Portland

to Seattle, Washington, on Northwest Orient Airlines Flight

number 305, which was a Boeing 727 aircraft.

Unsub paid for

this flight with a twenty dollar bill and had no luggage.

He occupied seat number 18E on the aircraft and prior to the

time the aircraft taxied on the runway, he purchased a

bourbon and Yun with a twenty dollar bill from Stewardess

PSI, however, after it taxied toward the runway for takeoff,

unsub turned

and handed Stewardess

Jan envelope

containing a note written In black felt-tip pen and which

was on plain white unlined paper and written in neat,

handwriting.

This note' informed Stewardess I

that

he had a bomb and instructed her,

to sit next to him.

Unsub then dictated to her his demands'

at the

conclusion of which he remarked. "No. fuss."

Stewardess

_showed Stewardess

the demand notes

and then went to the cockpit, where she displayed them to the

captain of the aircraft.

The unsub retrieved these notes

prior to the time the aircraft landed at Seattle, Washington.

She thereafter remained in the cockpit where she prepared

thirteen pages of notes concerning the hijacking and in which

she described unsub as in his fifties.

She later said he

appeared to be of Latin descent. It will be noted that one

of the aircraft passengers,

_ belleved

unsub was a Mexican-American.

She had a short encounter

with the unsub prior to her deplaning at Seattle, at which

time she said unsub did not appear to know exactly where he

wanted to go after he left seattle, but spoke of Mexico city,

Phoenix, and San Francisco.

Stewardessl

acted as a conmunications medla between the unsub and the

captain of the aircraft until about five minutes after the

aircrait departed the Seattle Tacoma National Airport (Sea-Tac)

when she was instructed to go to the cockpit by the unsub.

The aircraft landed at Sea-Tac at 5:46 p.., PST,

at which time $200,000 in twenty dollar bills, weighing

19 pounds, two back chutes, and two chest chutes were made

available

to him.

The passengers then were allowed to deplane

as were Stewardess

and another stewardess. This is

normally a thirty-six minute flight.

Shortly prior to the aircraft taking off fron

sea-tac at 1:36 p.u., PSt, the unsub informed Stewardess

that they were going to lexico city or someplace

In Mexico and that the aircraft could stop anywhere in Mexico

to refuel, but nowhere in the United states. When unsub was

informed that the fuel would not pormit the aircraft going to

Mexico, unsub compromised and said he would prefer a refueling

landing in Reno, Nevada. The last communication had with the

unsub was by interphone at 8:05 p.w., PST, and It was felt

that the unsub deplaned from the aircraft at 8:12 p.Il. The

aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, at 11:05 p.M., PST.

An

extensive ground search of the area where it was believed

the unsub exited the aircraft has proved negative.

when the aircraft landed at Reno, Nevada, a

chest pack chute and a back-type chute were found on the

The missing chest back chute is a training pack

Paunted up to look like a good one, The missing back

pack chute, sometimes referred to as

an emergency chute, is

non-steerable and anyone utilizing this type chute would

have no chance of slowing down or picking his spot on which

to land.

Also located in seat 18E of the aircraft at

Reno, Nevada, was a black clip-onitie which contained a tie

clasp described as yellow gold in color with a white pearl

circular stone in the center. The label in the tle bore the

name "Towncraft" and bore store #3 Penneys.

The label in

this tie showed it to be a "Snapper" patent type tie. Investi-

gation at Las Vegas Indicated that this type sold for about

a dollar and a half, that it was about a year to a year and

a half old, and it was a favorite item for individuals such

as walters, busboys, and bartenders. Stewardess!

Thas

said that this tle was probably the unsub's and other witnesses

have indicated that he wore a similar type tie.

on =

Located In the ashtray utilized by the unsub were

eight cigarett butts, seven of which have been identified by

the FBI Laboratory as Raleigh filter tip cigarettes, and the

eighth cigarette is probably the same. These cigarettes are

sold in a "soft pack."

During the period Stewardess

was with the

unsub and in her conversations withhim She related what appeared

to be keen observations concerning him, and which are as

follows:

1) He impressed her as being an executive because of his

dress, special mannerisms, and consideration that he exhibited

for her while on the aircraft.

2) In one of the conversations she had with him, she re-

marked that the parachutes were coming fron McChord Air Force

Base at which time he remarked that it was only about twenty

minutes from McChord to the Seattle-Tacona airport and which

was apparently an accurate estimate..

b6

b7C

b6

and remarked,

of this had been madecover the interphone of the aircraft.

4) He displayed an extensive and technical knowledge of

this aircraft and seemed particularly well Informed as to-

the refueling procedures and flying in general. He apparently

was aware of where the oxygen bottles were and

Stewardess

felt this information was normally known only by

the crew personnel.

The

only function of the aircraft that

he did not appear to be fully aware of was the procedures

Involved in the opening of the rear door and the extending .

of the stairway. He likewise appeared to be completely

familiar with the parachutes that had been furnished to him.

5) She said that the unsub was a chain snoker using Raleigh

filter tip cigarettes.

She observed him using a book of

matches, the cover of which was blue and bore the name

"Sky Chef."

6) Stewardess

asked him why he had chosen a North-

west airplane to hijack to which he replied that he had a

grudge but not against Northwest Airlines, but that Northwest

happened to be at the right place at the right time.

7) He used the expression "No fuss" on one occasion to

Stewardess

and "No funny stuff" on one occasion,

to Stewardess

You should place strong emphasis on the fact that

the unsub could be possibly a

former employee of one of the

West Coast aircraft or related industries, particularly

Boeing aircraft.

These Industries have been hard pressed

econonically, causing a number of lay-offs among professional

personnel as well as nonprofessional personnel and fron a

review of the naterial avallable at the Bureau, it is entirely

conceivable that the unsub falls in this category.

In view

of this, the following avenues of Intestigation should be

investigated by both the Seattle and Portland Offices:

1) Contact professional placement agencies, counselors. as well

asi employment contractors hiring temporary professional

employees.

2) Contact unemployment agencies.

3) Identify and contact professional societies or

organizations associated with the aircraft industry, being

alert for anyone that possibly terminated membership or

activity after 11/24/71.,

4). The age bracket of the unknown subject could probably

make him a Veteran of Horld WarlII, or the Korean conflict

and in this regard, you should contact Veteran groups and

the American Legion.

5) Seattle should submit to the FBI Laboratory the black

clip-on tie and clasp found on the aircraft at Reno, Nevada,

and request the FBI Laboratory to examine this material for

soil and dust particles in an effort to possibly pinpoint

the area of the country from which the unsub came from.
