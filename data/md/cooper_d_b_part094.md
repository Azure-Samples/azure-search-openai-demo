Accompanying one-page letter dated 3/28/72, beginning

"This letter is too..." and ending "A Rich Man"

Result of examination:

No indented writing was found on Q40 and Q41. No

watermarks were found on Q40.

The watermark "Millers Falls Ezerase Cotton Content"

appears on Q41. This is a watermark of the Millers Falls

Paper Company, Millers Falls, Massachusetts 01349.

The typewriting on Q40 and Q41 most closely matches

an Underwood style of elite type. This type is used on all

models of Underwood typewriters and may be used on typewriters

bearing names other than Underwood.

No connection could be established between Q40, Q41,

and the specimens submitted previously in this case.

Q40 and Q41 were photographed and will be returned

separately.

Washington, D.C.

Honorable Sir:

Shortly after 6:30 P.M. on April 10 I placed a

long distance call to the Regional Office of the

F.B.I. in Portland. The call was answered by a l

who turned the call over to al

after

II had stated my reasons for placing the call.

Briefly,

Ton the Oregon Coast I recently (Mar 23)

I to a certain party and

this subsequent actions have raised doubts in my

I mind.

(1). He carried on his person a large sum of

money-all in $2000 bills.

how

(2). Each time-he made a purchase - no matter

small-such as 2 packages of cigarettes (70¢) it

was with a $2000 bill and he never spent the change

or smaller bills. Each purchase was paid with a "new"

$2000 bill and the pattern was repeated again.

(3. He did not want to be alone and, if he

could, would get me or someone else to make his

purchases with one of his $2000 bills.

He was shown photograph:

of twelve white male individuals and asked if he coulc

In this other

he also uses as a point of identification.

He recalls that in his initial interview with

the FBI at the time of the hijacking, he had mentioned that

he thought the hijacker'
