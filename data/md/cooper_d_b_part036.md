Gentlemen:

few days are I wrote to you mentioning the name of

Perhaps I did not give you much to go on at that time.

Now I think I can do better. A few years ago there was

a commercial airplane hijacked in Oregon. The hijacker

was given the money he demanded, and a parachute.

He

escaped by parachuting from the

airplane.

My recollection of this incident is that the hijacker

of an age that made it possible that he was a paratrooper

during World War II. Certainly he had confidence in his

parachute, and knew what conditions were required. He

had the airplane slow down to a jumping speed before he jumped.

It is possible that he made things easier for you by applying

for a passport soon afterwards, if not beforehand. It 1s

also possible that he did not pose for his own passport photo,

but used the photo of someone else, but i think not. He

probably did not realize that nobody looks at those

photos.

If you should get the passport photo of

and show it to the hijacked aircrew, you might have somethin

right there. Even 1f

the time lImits for prosecution have

expired, it should be possible to recover the money.

Yours very truly

the lower road across this area about 200 vards south of the

edge of the dog-ler or switchhack in the dirt road.

The parachute,

parachute, according tol

was all twisted

up, as it to male a rope out of it, and then rolled un prior to

heing nut under the 1o0.

He estinated that there were approxi-

mately seven panels and

it apnears as if it had heen cut in half,

indicating the jumper may have gotten hung up in a tree.

further noted that from the upper portion

of this roar, he could look down across the canyon to the lower

road, where he had his camper-pickup parled by a culvert and

is where he was heading at the time he found the parachute.

lie advised the area around the parachute was rochy, with very

little timber and only a few windfalls.

He said approximately

I two trees together, one being a yellow

juniper tree, on the hill.

said in looking up the one tree, he noted that near the top,

about 65 feet up,

was

evidence that a linb, approximately

one and one half

inches in diameter, had been broken off.

Below this, approxinately 10 feet, he noted another linh,

two and one half inches by ahout three inches, had heen broken

off and below this, all the way down the tree, were other limbs

that appeared to have been hroken off. Ile said he could not

estinate the age of these limbs or when they were broken off

but that they did not appear to have been recent.

advised he speculated that maybe the parachute had been cut

in half to make a rope so that the jumper could have lowered

himself from the tree if he had been hung up in the tree.

then could have placed half of the parachute under the log,

where it was found, and kept the other half to keep warm and

maybe use the harness on the parachute as a pack rack to carry

out whatever he had

with him.

advised he was formerly in the u. s.

Forest service and he noted that the parachute he recovered

was similar to parachutes used hy the forest service smole

jumpers.

rowever, the parachutes the forest service used,

although similar in color, were usually larger than this

particular one.

further noted that approximately one

mile northeast of where he found the parachute, near the

Bear valley Poad, is a grass level meadow area,

about 200

acres in size.

In addition, south of this area, approximately

one mile down Lemon Canyon Road, is another arass meadow flat

area, approximatelv 200 acres in size.

In addition,

noted that there is a

very small airport at

fierraville, California, and that the

beacon light from this

airport shines in the direction of

where the parachute

was found.

advised he recalled that the hijacker

in the instant case had the pilot fly at an elevation of

approximately 10,000 feet en

route to Reno, Nevada.

noted that on the may, the elevation of Sardine Peak is

same general area, is only 7,575 feet.

the hijacker may have Jinown

this and planned to land in one

of the

two above descrihed meadows and missed his target

but realized the plane would have to fly at 10, 100 feet in

order to miss sardine Peak.

advised another strange thing is that

Five miles from where he turned northwest on the junction, wa:

also located in a very strange place. He noted that it had,

apparently, been driven off the dirt road, up under the trees.

He said it is now on its side

but obviously had to be driven

to the point where it is now instead of towed there and abandoned.

Te said there are no houses or any people in this remote area,

where the car and parachute vere located, where he was deer

in Oregon and Washington.

He stated that, in view of thereeent

anniversary of NR JAK matter, that he desired an interview with

the FBI concerning this matter and stated he felt this could

possibly generate interest in viewers who may have information

of value in this matter but have not come forward at this time.

He stated he would be in Longview at 10:00 AM, 12/10/75

and hopefully interview with FBI could take place at that time.

In view of negative efforts to date to locate and/or identify

examined

the remains of an orange and white parachute which had

been recovered under a

log near Sardine Mountain,

California.

advised, after carefully examining this

parachute, that it appeared to be a 28 foot emergency-type

parachute which had been manufactured by the Army and Air

Force prior to 1955 or 1956.

advised that to the best of his knowledge,

this type

parachute had been discontinued

in 1955 or 1956

in favor of multi-colored type parachutes.

vised that this type parachute was used by the Army and

Air Force as an emergency parachute in fixed wing aircraft

of the U-6-A and U-I-A types.

noted that the connector links and. D-rings

were no longer present on the parachute.

advised

it issued by the military, this type parachute could not

be steered; however, this

type of parachute has been made

available through surplus sales to members of Sky Clubs

and jump enthusiasts who usually alter the parachutes

so that

they can be steered.

Jadvised that he could not determine

whether this parachute, in particular, had been altered

in view of the

faot that it has deteriorated due to the

effects of the elements on it.

Jadvised that this parachute could have

been used either as a front-pack or a back-pack. He

advised that he could not determine which way it had

been used in view of the fact that the connector links

and D-rings were not present.
