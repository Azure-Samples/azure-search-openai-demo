in 12/9/71 I called SAC MATTSON in Portland

AC CAMPBELL, in Las Vegas and ASAC MORLEY in San Francisco

I talked to all of them about publishing the

ransom list in a newspape of wide circulation in their

areas. All of them said they believed they could have

this done, would do it and let us know.

12/9/71

I called the Bureau on 12/9/71 and talked to SA

these $20 bills. 'I wondered if the Bureau had given considera-

tion to instructing all SAC's to have this one.

He called back and said they were not going to do

this because first, they did not think most newspapers would

publish it; second, they did not want all SAC's to have the

feeling

that they had to get it published, which might cause

a great deal of difficulty around the field. He said he

thought their instructions were sufficient, that if we could

arrange to get it published in our division, and if we wanted

to call other offices on a selected basis, and see if the

SAC's could work out some arrangement to publish it, he would

leave that up to us. He definitely stated that we had

authority to get the list published if we so desired.

furnished to the San Francisco Office for publication as

above mentioned.

also asked if the entire course of the

flight had been searched.

He was advised that the pertinent

part of the State of Washington as well as all of Oregon,

and Nevada, had been checked but apparently the area in

california had not yet been searched due to the fact that the

reconnaissance plane had been unable to fly the course due

•to bad weather.

jumping in street shoes requires expertise in sky-diving;

high flying level of plane indicates expert ability.

I told him that|

that MANNING had been told not to make any remarks to the

press and that the remarks described by him were common

talk among the law enforcement officials and that the

Sheriffs from Clark and Cowlitz had been interviewed

extensively by the press, and that I was certain that MANNING

had made no such remarks.

He requested a teletype about it.

the following investigation should be instituted:

1. Identify and then contact each flying school

for anyone who might fit the subject's description as

having rented a plane, etc.

Identify and then contact all air fields

which might

have rented such an aircraft to anyone who

could answer the subject's description in this case.

3. Identify and contact each sky diving school

PuB,

At 8:20 PM on November 24, 1971, I talked to

SA DON HANNING at the Bureau. I told him

there was a.

substantial number of the members of the press in the

immediate vicinity of the airport and they were extremely

anxious to have a statement from the Bureau. I advised

him that I proposed that I go to them and outline the

essential facts of the case so far as sequence of events

are concerned and the present status.

In this, after

checking with Northwest Airlines officials I would advise

them that $200,000 had been paid to the kidnapper by

Northwest Airlines, that four parachutes had been furnished

to him, and that the plane was then aloft enroute to either

Reno, Nevada, Sacramento, California or Medford, Oregon.

He advised this would be satisfactory.

This item, which

be a parachute canopy, was recovered buried along the

provided this item to the FBI on August 2,

It was noted that the canopy is still very wet and

contains a large quantity of sand. During the review in Seattle

small green markings were noted on the canopy.

As Seattle has no facility to properly dry an item this

size, it was packed in paper and is being provided in a wet

condition.

Of note, in February 1980, $5800 in currency identified

with this hijacking was recovered from the Tena Bar area of the

Columbia River, just south of Vancouver. A flow study

commissioned by

the FBI at that time determined that the money

had likely been naturally deposited in that location and had

probably flowed down the Washougal River or one of its

tributaries.

The Washougal River empties into the Columbia

immediately down river (west) from Reed Island.

SU. 3-0475, who is employed for the remainder of the school

year at sharpless Junior high school, 3928 South Graham,

Seattle, telephone PA. 5-3562, furnished the following infor-

mation:

The back parachute, as well as the orange colored chest

chute, both of which had been left on flight 305, were examined

by Mr. COSSEY, after which he advised that he had personally

packed these two chutes as well as the other back pack and the

other chest pack which were taken by the hijacker when he left

the aircraft. COSSEY advised that he personally made up the

back pack, also referred to as an "emergency chute" from com-

ponent parts which he either had in his shop or which he pur-

chased for the occasion.

He explained that

Hayden Manu-

Facturing Company at Renton,

washington, had need for two

emergency parachutes.

The one that is now in possession of

the FBl was one of those packed by COSSEY and is a 26' white

canopy parachute.

The nissing back chute was described as Follows:

Main Chute

28* flat, circular chute made of white nylon and

white cords. This chute, because of its flat circular shape

will have precisely 28 panels and they will be numbered 1 thru

The number is very clear on each panel.

In addition, one

the panels, probably panel 28, and if not there, on the cen

ter panel, there will appear a large identification which will

show the name of the manufacturer, when the chute was made,

the military contract number under which made and will have

a precise serial number.

Pilot Chute

Made of white nylon (not measured), white shroud cords

and is described as a Model A-3 "soft top".

Harness & Container

A Sage Green Navy N.B.-6 harness which does not have

a Doring, which is used to attach a chest parachute to the

back pack. Tlie container itself is a Sage Green nylon. Both

the harness and container were Navy surplus and will have a

label on the outside of the container to identify the Navy

contract number and probably the name of the company which

made it.

COSSEY advised that all chutes are identified to the

particular chute by a serial number placed thereon by the manu-

facturer. In addition, a parachute must be repacked perio-

dically and the missing parachute was repacked by COSSEY and

the date as well as other identifying data placed on a card

which is then inserted in a pocket on the container.

COSSEY advised that his records do contain the serial

numbers of the various parachutes that he has made and/or in-

spected and that he would check his record for the serial num-

ber of the missing parachute.

COSSEY advised that the missing parachute is made

up of a surplus Navy harness

and container and that he very

definitely would be able to identify the chute.

The missing chert chute was described as

follows:

Main Chute

This is actually the only chute in the chest

nylon with white shroud lines and was actually made up

by COSSEY from a parachute which had been scrapped. COSSEY

said he doubts if the serial number is still on the chute

secause he cut the parachute in half and then sewed it

ogether. He did this in order to make the chute smal:

enough to fit into the container. COSSEY explained that

the chute was placed in a container and was used for

training purposes of students learning to parachute and

was not intended ever to be used as a real parachute.

He said the trainee was suspended approximately

three feet from the ground during part of his training

process and simulated operating the back pack as well as

the chest chute.

COSSEY advised that he very definitely would be

able to identify the chest pack whether or not there is a

serial number on it. However, if there is a serial number

on it, COSSEY said he would have made no record of it because

it was a scrapped chute.

COSSEY also explained that an experienced jumper

who inspected the dummied up chest chute probably would

be aware that it was not operable.

Re Okla. City airtel to Bureau dated 2/11/72.

The following investigation was conducted by SA

AT TAHLEQUAH, OKLAHONA

On 4/4/72,

L National Director of th

Parachute Association and Assistant Director of the

World Parachute Meet, Tahlequah, advised he is well faniliar

with the description

and the artist's conception photo of the

subject, due to publication in parachute magazines and the

skyjacking being the topic among many skydivers.

advised it 15 his opinion tronthe information he has

; read

in newspapers that the skyjacker mightpossibly be a smoke

jumper or military junper, as opposed to a sports skydiver

in that the subject apparently jumped under circumstances

which were very adverse to a successful landing.

advised that he will be alert for the

possibility of anyone matching the subject's description

jumping in either the world meet or in the national meet,

both to be held at Tahlequah during the summer of 1972;

if he comes across anyone similar to the subject, he will

THO

' of these

parachutes were apparently used by the hijacker when he

parachuted fron the plane.

inquiries from the

person who

supplied the parachutes either

to have the parachutes returned to him, or have Northwest

Airlines pay for then.

On November 27, 1971

a man who is

familiar with parachute clubs and jumpers in the southwestern

part of Washington and northern part of Oregon, advised that

a person jumping from a plane at about 7000 feet who had

experience could free fall and while doing so could count

to 25 seconds which would then place him at 3000 feet and

for this reason no altimeter would be needed.

He pointed

out that if the subject could have seen the ground there would

be no problem in landing if he had experience as a jumper.

He further pointed out that his experience as a jumper

shows him that the subject would not have needed jump boots,

a helmet, jump suit, or any other special equipment for

he and other chutists jump in shorts, tennis shoes, and

other non-jumping equipment when weather conditions are

right. He also pointed out that the subject could land

within one mile of a pin point spot picked if he had

experience and knew when to jump.

Further, he stated the

subject would have travelled 1/2 to 3/4 of

a mile from the

drop line from the plane in a 30 mile per hour wind if he

opened his chute at 3000 feet.

also advised that

he could also state that if the subject had experience

he would know that the easiest place to put a container with

the money would be between his legs and this would not

cause any problems on landing or during descent.

suggested one person whom he thought could be capable of

the hijacking and that would be

who is a

good and experienced parachutist and pilot.

advised that the parachute clubs in the

arda he is familiar with are the Pacific Parachute Club

which uses Donald airfield 30 miles south of Portland,

Oregon, and the Western Sport Parachute Center which uses

both the Frink field and the Hockinson field near Vancouver,

Washington; he pointed out that Puckett airfield is no

longer used

a jump center.

On November 28, 1971

Vancouver

Piper Aviation, 209 East Reserve Street,

the area would have attempted such a jump and further

that a small control receiver such as a Very High trequency

Omni Receiver (VOR) or a ground beacon receiver unit could

have been utilized to secure an almost pin point landing.

He also pointed out that in the vicinity of Cougar, Wash-

ington which is located in Cowlitz County at the northeastern

end of Yale Lake, there is an air traffic intersection

used by instrument rated pilots to secure their location

and such an intersection could have been utilized by the

hijacker with a portable. receiving unit.

advised he had reviewed his records

relative to the name

and located only two matters

under that name, He advised on 12/10/70, he shipped some

material to L

Seattle, Washingcon. On 8/16/71, he shipped some material

to l

Snohonish, Washington.

He advised he has no reason to consider the above as

suspects other than the last name. He also advised from

the handwriting on the letters received requesting material,

it is likely that these are the same persons, as the hand~

writing is similar. The handwriting is available, should

it be desired for comparison purposes.

advised the only central records he

knows of regarding a mailing list for sky divers or clubs

would be the association in Monterey, California, which

distributes a magazine nationwide and should have a mailing

List.

advised that he doubts the person who

comnitted this crime was a shy diver.

He noted that he

has heard that the parachutes furnished to the man were a

commercial brand named "Pioneer" and a now surplus Navy

parachute designated "NB-8". He stated if this is a fact,

he doubts the man is a sky diver inasmuch as anyone with

sky-diving experience would have asked for a sky-diving

type parachute, which neither of the above are.

further advised that the above paradates

would be hazardous to use inasmuch as that type of chute

would open very quickly, with a possibility of tearing,

and both have a high rate of descent and very limited

control. In his opinion, a person using such a chute would

probably have prior military jumping experience but would

not have skydiving experience.

He further noted that an

experienced sky diver would have asked for a chute such as

a "Para-Commander", which would be readily available in an

area such as Seattle, Washington. This type of parachute

opens more slowly, is very maneuverable, and has a much

slower rate of descent.

On 12/20/71, FLOYD WASHBURN, Manager, U.S.

Parachute Service, 6976 E. Baseline, Mesa, Arizona, was

contacted regarding captioned matter. WASHBURN stated he wàs

familiar with this matter and believed the subject would have

had to have been a sporting parachutist and parachute rigger

in order to accomplish his feat.

WASHBURN indicated a listing of licensed parachutists

Is maintained by the U,S. Parachute Association in Monterey,

California:

The U.S. Parachute Association has supposedly

instituted

a policy approximately two years ago wherein they

have on file photographs of all licensed paradutists.

Inquiries made to the U.S, Parachute Association should be

Monterey,

California.

Although it is noted approximately 40 percent of

the nation's parachutists are licensed, this could conceivably

be a worthwhile lead for office of origin in this matter.

Phoenix will attempt to conduct appropriate investi-

gation to ascertain the location of the list for licensed

parachute riggers.

of dynamite and could

only describe it as stated above,

adding that it was of

a reddish rusty color.

then advised the pilot's conpartment

of the fact the plane was being hijacked via the intercom.

She used the intercon while remaining in her seat inasmuch as

It was close by and she could reach sare from her seated

she so advised the pilot's compartient.

It was with a pre-arranged signal of bells that

She also at that

time on a plain envelope wrote out the demands of the hijacker,

Ilsting that he wanted four parachutes including two back

packs and two chest packs, $200,000.00 in cash in small

bills and that he wanted all this "by five o'clock".

She

recalls that

delivered this note to the pilot's

compartment inasmuch as the

hijacker insisted that she be

physically present alongside him at all times.

She recalled

that she sat with him almost the entire time of the flight.

recalled that during the flight from

Portland to Seattle, all passengers wore moved at least

three rows forward from where the hijacher was seated.

stated that at one time he commented

that "the bomb" he had

was electrically fused and he certainly hoped the crew vould

not generate any electrical currents which would trifter it.

In response to her query as to why he had chosen a Northwest

airplane to hijack, she related his statenent to the effect

that he had "a grudge" but not against Northwest Airlines,

adding that the Northwest plane just happened to be in the

right place at the right tine.

In response to her query

at one time during their conversation as to vhere he came

refusal to answer and seened sonewhat provoked by the question.

Sometime before going into the landing pattern at

the Seattle - Tacoma Airport, the hijacker reiterated his

previous instructions that all the itens he had requested,

including the noney and the parachutes, must be available at

the atrport before he would permit the plane to land. He

also instructed that upon landing, l

was

• to be

his intermediary in not only delivering messages to the crew

but also in transferring the items that he had requested from .

the ground to hin in the aircraft. He specifically instructed

that upon landing

only one unmarked automobile should approach

the aircraft and it should approach and park in such a position

that the hijacker could observe it at all tines. He also

instructed that the pickup rig which delivers the exit stairway

to the forward compartnent of the atroraft be avallable

immediately upon landing in order that

go out the forward door and contact the intermediary in the.

unnarked car to obtain the Items he had requested. Additionally,

he instructed that a fuel truck be available in the area upon

landing and same fuel truck was to be manned by only one

1

employee.

He was insistent that every condition be met and

that everything be available on the ground prior to the

landing of the aircraft.

recalls that the aircraft went into a

holding pattern for. a period of time she estimated over one

hour and she stated she felt this was because all of the iteus

the iljacker had requested vere not yet available on the ground.

After a period of time

said the aircraft

landed and an announcement was made from the cockpit rather

than bya hostess in the cabin, as is the normal procedure,

to the

effect that some

mechanical difficulty had been en

countered and the passengers were all requested to remain in

their seats with their seat belts fastened.

recalls that the hijacker went to the nearby lavatory at

this time stating he would return in a few minutes, at which

time the stairway to the forward door should be ready.

When

he went to the lavatory, he closed the attache case and carried

It with him. He came out of the lavatory in a matter of three

or four minutes and again took the same seat he had occupied.

When the forward door stairway was attached,

departed the aircraft through the forward door as soon as

the stairs were put in place.

She noted there was one car

parked at approxinately ten o'clock to the aircraft, the

pickup rig was in the area and a fuel truck immediately

went about attempting refueling of the aircraft.

She stated

she obtained a bag from an unknown male individual who got

out of the car which was parked near the aircraft and although

she is unable to recall the precise wording, she was told that

the bag contained the money requested. She

took the bag

reportedly contalning the money back to seat 18-E, which

seat was still occupied by the hijacker. He opened the bag

and inspected the contenis which

said she

observed wus money pacised in small packages with bank-type

bands around each package.

Having inspected the money in a

cursory fashion, the hijacker stated that "it looked okay"

and then indicated to

that the crew could now

permit the passengers to deplane.

She atated that she called

the cockpit on the intercom with this message and an announce

ment was made from the cockpit that passengers could at that

time disembars.

recalled that she, in an attempt

at being humorous, stated to the hijacker while

were unloading that there was obviously a lot of money in the

bag and she wondered if she could have some. The hijacker

of the money, denominations unrecalled by

then again left the aircraft and this tine brought back

the

two smaller parachute packs (chest pacis) and gave

these to the hijacker.

She made a last trip fion the

aircraft then to obtain another of the large parachute

packs (another back pack).

All of the parachutes were

given to the hijacker and he was observed by

The hijacker further indicated to

that as

soon as this lowering of the door and stairs were

accomplished in flight, she would be permittea to go to

the pilot's compartment. During the period of furnishing

these conditions, the hijacker becane extremely annoyed

over the time required to refuel the plane as he had ordered.

The hijacker displayed an extensive knowledge

of the aircraft and seemed specifically well inforied in

refueling procedures to the point that the crew had difficulty

in convincing him that only 96% of the required fuel was on

board at the time he was protesting the fact that refueling

had not been completed. It was also during this time (when

he was upset concerning refueling) that he complained to

also that he had requested the money be delivered

to him in a knapsack and instead it was delivered in a cloth

for him with the last match in the paper match folder.

recalled stating he did not want her to throw it away. she

that he smoked

Raleigh filter tips.

In connenting

concerning the hijacker's actions in general, she stated that

she recalled some

conversation to the effect

that the parachutes

were coming Iron Mic Chord kir Force Base.

The hijacker remarised

that it was about 20 minutes from Mc Chord to the Seattle -

Tacoma Airport.

She also recalled that while they were in

the holding pattern prior to landing, he at one time looked

out the window and observed "We're over Tacoma now". C

indicated that there had been no announcement or no

mention

that the aircraft was over Tacoma and she accordingly

concluded that the hijacker was famillar with the area.

After refueling was completed and takeoff appeared

imminent, the crew called on the intercom and advised that

after checking with appropriate authorities,

they had been

told

that the

fuel load would not permit them to fly nonstop

to Mexico City, or anywhere in Mexico, in fact. They pointed

out that the range of fuel was such that they recommended

landing

to refuel somewhere in the San Francisco, California

area.

The hijäcker countered with Phoenix, Arizona, as an

alternative landing for refueling. When the crew responded

1n the negative due to the distance to Phoenix, Arizona, he

that time stated the aircraft could make Yuma, Arizona,

or Reno, Nevada, and he preferred a landing in Reno, Nevada.

The crew

called

back and stated they would proceed to Reno,

Nevada,

stated that upon takeoff

from Seattle,

the hijackor was in seat 18-D or E (occupying both seats at

various times) and she was seated across the aisle in 18-c.

It was during this time, as she recalls it, that he was occupled

with opening one of the

parachute packs (recalling the color

of the parachute as a bright pink-orange color) and attempting

to in some way pack the money in a parachute container in order

that he could in some way attach it to his body along with the

regular parachute straps.

Her recollections in this regard

were vague, but she stated she clearly recalled his removing

a small

jack Inife fron his pocket and

cutting sone portion

of eithor the outside container or the parachute in order to

secure the money in this rather than in the white bank-type

bag which he had been furnished.

Her recollection was that

she did not see him tampering with the two large parachute

containers other than to cursorily inspect then when she had

brought them aboard.

After the plane was airborne, there was conversation

• between

and the hijacker regarding her opening the

rear door and extending the stairway.

She told him that she

was fearful of being sucked out of the airplane and, accordingly,

wanted to tie an emergency safety rope around her waist and

attach it to a seat in order to prevent being sucked out of

the door when she opened it. He told her at that time it

would not be necessary for her to use the emergency safety

rope inasmuch as he would cut one of the parachute shroud

Iines for her to insure her safety when she opened the door.

It was at this time that he was still working with the para-

chute to in some way secure the money to his body.. Shortly

therealter he asked her to demonstrate to him the procedure

for opening the rear door, and extending the stairway. She

did this and was under the impression that he understood

how to do it. She commented that it occurred to her at this

time that this was the only function of the aircraft which she

had discussed with the hijacker during the time she

with him which he did not seem to be fully aware of.

that as a matter of fact, he had even shown a knowledge of where

located at an earlier time, which

information she felt is normally known only to air crew personnel.

While she could not recall specifically, she stated there were

several other comments he made which indicated to her that he

had an extensive technical knowledge of this particular type

of alrcralt and perhaps aircraft and flying in general.

She

also commented that he appeared to be completely familiar with

the parachutes which had been furnished to hin.

It was estimated by

that in less than

five minutes after takeofi, the hijacker suddenly told her to

go forward of the aft compartment, to close the curtain behind

her and not to return to the rear compartment again.

quickly complied with this request, going to the first

to the cockpit and closing and locking the cockpit door

behind her.

She did not thereafter leave the pilot's com-

partment and had no further conversation with the hijacker

running from the cylinders towards a large 6" x 8" x 2" in

diameter battery.

The wire had a red plastic coating around it,

all with the exception of the last inch which was bare and which

the man held in between his

fingers.

He told her it was an

electronic device and suggested the

• aircraft radio be used as

little as possible.

He said he didn't think radio transmissions

would bother it, but wanted to let the crew know.

She then called the pilot over the interphone and ad-

vised him of the device and from that point on she acted as a

communications nedia between the hijacker and the pilot through

the interphone. During one message to the pilot, he specified

that he wanted $200,000 in circulated U.S. currency, two

One of the specific demands that he

made was that the fuel truck is to come first and start fueling

During the

flight from Portland to Seattle, she had

light conversation with the hijacker.

For example, she asked

him where he was from and he became upset and said he didn't

want to answer that.

She somehow brought up that they would be

going to Cuba and mentioned that personnel were advised to warn

passengers against buying any Cuban rum or cigars because W. S.

Customs would confiscate them when they returned to the United

States.

The hijacker laughed and said that they weren't going

to Cuba, but that she would like where they were going.

asked her where

indicated that Minneapolis, Minn., was very nice country.

She asked him why he picked Northwest Airlines to

hilack and he laughed

and said,

"It's not because I have a

grudge

against your airlines,

it's just because I have a

grudge."

He paused and said that the flight suited his time,

place,

and plans.

Other conversation centered around personal

habits such

as smoking and he asked her if she did and she said

she used to but had quit and he offered her a cigarette which

she

took and smoked.

and

She asked if he wanted any food or drink

he refused

everything.

During the flight from Portland to Seattle, a male

customer started aft down the isle and she met him at ap-

proximately Row 14 where she asked him what he wanted and he

Indicated he was looking for a sports magazine.

They went to

the aft section of the plane immediately behind the hijacker

where they looked and finally he accepted a New Yorker Magazine

and returned to his seat.

After he was seated and_

to seat 18 D, next to the hijacker, he said, "If that is a Sky

Marshal

I don't want any more of that," and

she reassured him

that it

wasn't and

further, that there were no sky marshals

on that flight.

A short while after that, the pilot called her and

asked her to deternine fron the hijacker if he wanted the pilot

to inform the pasrengers of the aituation, and the hijacker said,

"no." The pilot said that he would make up another excuse to

cover the extension of the flight way beyond the normal 36

minutes.

It was at this point the hijacker instructed her to

tell the pilot that he wanted the note and envelope back that

he had given to the other stewardess.

He also wanted the empty

matchbook cover from which he had been lighting his cigarettes

and had thrown into the back pouch of the seat in front as she

said she would normally do with trash.

She indicated that he

had another book of matches the cover of which was blue and

said, "Sky Chef." from which she had pulled matches to light his

cigarettes.

He ragained this book of natches.

The hijacker made a comment while the aircraft was

in a holding pattern north of the airport that it is 5:15 and

A few minutes later, the pilot called

The flight landed at Seattle International Airport

at 5:45 Pacific time.

permission from the hijacker to park his aircraft away from the

he wouldn't rather have one of the cockpit crew get the chutes

and he told her that they weren't that heavy and she wouldn't

have any trouble.

When she returned to the plane with the last chute,

she saw he had one chute cut open and nylon cords out and he

was cutting them with his pocket knife.

He took the nylon

cord and wrapped it around the neck of the money bag numerous

times

and then he wrapped it a few times from top to bottom,

and with the same piece

This nylon cord was pinkish in color.

cause they had been on the pround over an hour and she related

this

to the cockpit and they answered that they had only 1500

this to the hijacker and he said, "no," he didn't want her to

the aft door and locked it open and the pilot started the en-

gines and taxied towards the runway. During the taxi, she

said, "You know we have oxygen, 'ard he said, "Yes, I know where

the bomb in 18 F. The plane took off and she held' her ears

because the noise was so loud from the engines.

Approximately

four minutes arter take off, he stood up, told her to go to

the cockpit and close the first class curtains, and for no one

to come out from behind the curtains. The lights were out in

the near compartment and she went forward, faced the curtain,

and the last time she saw him he had a nylon cond tied around

his waist and was standing in the isle.

Before she finished

securing the curtain, she pleaded with him to take the bomb

with him and he said

he would take it with him or disarm it

before he leaves.

After securing the curtain, she entered the cochpit

the Boeing 727 which you are generally familiar with, the

rear stairway flying at 10,000 feet through clouds at about

178 knots on IFR Flight, what would be the conditions that

would exist as soon as the cabin was depressurized?

PARASE

A.

As soon as the hatch. was cracked, there would

be depression matters of the aircraft.

The lowering of the

stairwell would create a

effect on the entire aircraft

because the air flow is disrupted here which would naturally

effect the aircraft.'

b6

b7C

Q. This would have no material effect on the jumper

physiologically at this altitude?

A. No, not at 10,000 feet.

I. This would be a very practical altitude in

which to jump?

DB Cooper-26995

A. Certainly.

Q. Would this be an ideal type aircraft from

A.

I. Given the consitions at night time with

clouds below to about 7,000 feet and partial clouds

and intermittent clouds taken to a ceiling about 4,000

feet, would this present any problems to

a jumper?

A. There again we're dealing with variables.

If a man knew what altitude at the time he was leaving

the aircraft, there are two ways to determine his altitude

on opening:

1. From the second hand on a wristwatch; •

2. A wrist type altimeter.

Q. Making this jump, what would be practical

for the man to do?

To open the chute immediately or to

wait until he had a view of the ground?

A. I would wait at least ten seconds before

pulling. This way I am not only clear of the aircraft,

but I am also out of visual sight of the aircraft or any

, aircraft in the area. Cloud covering is an advantage but

not knowing where the ground is, is a problem because of the

peaks in the area.

The above procedure would be in effect

if I was not in familiar territory. Another advantage of

an early chute opening would be for the jumper to select

the best drop zone possible.

In unfamiliar territory and wherein a light might

be observed, would give the jumper not only an idea of his

altitude but an opportunity for steering himself toward

a suitable drop zone.

In chuting in familiar territory, this type of

dropp would be rather

"simple to an experienced jumper".

This would allow the jumper to "free-fall" for the full

40 second delay time. This would put him at approximately

2,000 feet altitute when the chute opens which still gives

the ven the

him another three minutes to the ground.

-Footwear for an experienced jumper is inconsequential.

Jumping into a heavily wooded area is also

relatively simple.

Jumping into water is even more simple for an

experienced jumper.

Q. If the wind velocity at 10,000 feet was 25

knots and the ground level five knots, roughly how far

could he travel?

A. He would be in the saddle for ten minutes.

In a clear and pull situation (immediate opening of th

chute), he could go five miles on the wind line or win

direction; and a normal delayed opening maximum distance

with a five knot wind would be two or three thousand feet.

Even with a non-steerable chute, by taking hold of the

risers and facing into the wind

and making an almost direct

descent which would also produce a very soft landing

equivalent to stepping off a chair.

Q. Would the spped of the plane at 178 knots

present any problem?

A. No, not for a jumper.

Q. Based on the information we have discussed,

here, does this jump present any problem to an experienced

jumper?

A. None whatsoever.

I. Do you think this man made this type of jump

before.

A. I would say he has made some high altitude

parachutist.

D. In a free-fall from 10,000 feet to approximately

Q. What would the possibility be of the jumper

shoes?

shouldn't create any problem.

It

From the information furnished regarding the above

situation, it is my opinion that this jumper was experienced

and I would say having at least 150 jumps.

What would your guess be as to the number

of jumpers in the country that could pull this type of

jump off?

A. At least 1000 people.

In the "Parachutist" put out by the U. S. Parachute

Association, there are listed the names and state from which

they are from for every individual which has obtained a

license, whether it is Class A, B, C, D, Or I.

A Class C jumper could have made the above jump.

There are currently 7192 licensed Class C jumpers-to say

nothing of Class D'or I.

As of this month, there are 3094 Class D jumpers.

Class I is not given.

The above figures do not include military personnel

that have done high altitude free-fall jumps. There is no way

to determine how many jumpers would be in that category.

The only time lapse necessary from departure of the

aircraft to the opening of the chute is that time needed to

stabilize the body and this is determined by each jumpers

capabilities.

Hould accepting an untomi lar chute present

any problem to this person?

A.

It wouldn't bother me. I would certainly

check it over as would any experienced jumper.

D. This would take less than ten minutes?

A: Yes.

Q. Could an average Forest Service Smoke Jumper

pull off this job?

A. I doubt it.

Bearing in mind smoke jumpers are

for the most part all static line jumpers as is military,

and unless they're doing some skydiving on the side.

In all likelihood, the

smoke jumper could be

eliminated.

would you discuss the age factor of a man

45 to 50 in parachute jumping?

How many are active?

A. Very few.

However, high altitude jumpers in that age

group would be extremely limited.

These would be officials

of jump clubs or parachute governing bodies and/or instructors.

Q. Bringing the age factor into this, would that

change your estimate of the extess with which this jump

could be performed?

A. No, because of the fact it requires no special

physical condition to pull off a jump if you know what you're

Q. Could you estimate how many residents in

the State of Washington or oregon could have pulled this

off?

A.

No.

For record purposes,

I called SAC WHALEY at Albuguerque

near poet to to de to at there wexico

dealing with the

effect on a body of high altitude parachuting

and the effect of low temperatures on a body in case a jump

was made.

I asked him to see if he could contact the

person responsible for the survey to give us some notions about

what effect this would have on the man making this jump.

I told him that the weather was clear to 1500 feet,

broken clouds to 5,000, solid above, and that the jump was

possibly made around 7,000 to 10,000 It. at a time when the

"total average temperature" was minus 7 degrees.

Minneapolis, called

on 11/29/71.

1. He said that 90% of the skydivers are licensed

by the U.S. Parachute Association, P.O. Box 109, Monterey.,

California. The license has a photograph of the individual;

however, he does not believe that the association maintains

these photos although they do maintain descriptions.

2. Northwest people have discussed this jump with a

pilot who has made 500 parachute jumps, including two at

night.

He said that with a lighted target, a man could

come within 1000 feet of the target from the height that they

were flying on the night in question, and that you could

guide yourself as much as 45 degrees

in either direction with

a plain survival type parachute, if you had the knowledge.

3. He stated that theyhave been passing information

on to us based on the "pressure bump" indicating that the

man had jumped north of Portland. He said it was entirely

possible that the man did not jump wieh this "pressure bump"

took place.

It was entirely possible that he sat on the

end of the stairs to check out his reference points before

he jumped. If he did this for even a short time, he could

have easily landed across the river in Oregon.

He pointed out in this connection that there is

Aurora Field near Donald, Oregon.

SUB-

111/29/71

Dato of Iranscriplion.

KARL J. COSSEY, 349 North 10lst, Seattle, telephone

S03-0475, appeared at the Seattle Office at which

time he

furnished the following information:

He is a master parachute rigger and jump instructor

at Seattle Sky Sports, Issaguah, Washington, telephone

EX2-3050.

In May, 1971,

Washington,

needed two parachutes.

COSSEY

packed two parachutes which were furnished to L

or about May 1971.

He described these parachutes as

back packs, commonly referred to as "emergency" parachutes.

He also packed: the two chest pack parachutes which were

furnished to Northwest Airlines on November 24, 1971.

The two parachutes recovered fron the Northwest

Airlines flight 305 at Reno, Nevada, on November 24, 1971,

were described in detail to MI. COSSEY at which time he

described the missing back pack parachute as having a sage

green nylon container, model NB6 (Navy Back pack 6) with

sage green nylon harness, which harness has no "D" rings

The parachute is a 28 foot nylon

white flat circular with a specially fitted foam padded

cushion. The pilot chute is also white.

Mr. COSSEY said that the missing chest pack para-

chute is a ground training pack dummied up to look like a

good one. He said that by "durmied up" he means that tie

downs were attached to the container.

This chest pack

was devised

• by COSSEY to teach trainees while hung in a

harness how to open the chest pack in the event of an

emergency. The folds of the parachute are sewen together

to preclude the parachute opening in the training room.

MI. COSSEY said that the back packs furnished the hijacker

did not have the necessary hooks on the harness to attach

a chest pack.

Mr. COSSEY said that if the hijacker opened one

of the chest packs on the airplane he probably would

renove the parachute and put the money in the chest pack

as it would be impossible to hold anything in his hand

when the parachute opened.

MI. COSSEY said it would

be quite possible to parachute from a 727 jet if the jet

was below 10,000 feet and flying at a very slow rate of

The person jumping from the plane would have to

free fall to earth for several thousand feet to slow

himself down and get himself in position for the back

pack to open.

Even an experienced parachutist would

experience considerable shock from the chute opening,

however, this would cause little or no personal injury.

He said

that anyone who had six or seven practice jumps

could accomplish this as the first five jumps would be

on a static line and the subsequent jumps would be free

He said that jumping

at night materially increases

the chance of injury and in this case he would consider

the parachutists chances of not being injured as "nill."

Mr. COSSEY said the back pack used by the hijacker is

non-steerable and he would have no chance of

slowing down

ox picking the spot on which to land. Also at night he

would be unable to gauge his distance to the ground which

would result in a much

harder impact.

It was his opinion

the skyjacker would suffer severe ankle and or leg injuries

from this jump.

Mr. COSSEY

said that the fact the hijacker wore

street shoes would also increase the chance that he would

be injured on landing as the most experienced jumpers

wear jump boots or some rigid ankle support.

MI. COSSEY expressed the opinion that the pilot

of the jet would notice some oscillation when the hijacker •

departed the rear of the aircraft.

On 3/15/72 SA HENRY SCHUTZ, at the Bureau called

and advised that after many machinations the Army had given its

approval to using the Army troops to make the terrain search.

I thereafter received a call from |

Lewis, who advised that he had received word from the 6th

Arny in San Francisco that they would not be permitted to

participate. Shortly thereafter I received another call from

They anticipate making a reconnaissance of the

area before moving the troops in. He advised that they

want to make it on a 7-day a week operation, which is

satisfactory with us.

These individuals were extremely professional in their approach

to the problem and exhibited an intense desire to assist in this

Bureau operation.

They supplied their own living accomodations

and most of their food plus radio communications.

It is felt that an offer by

to possibly have

more than the above mentioned members of the Association work a

larger area with more dogs on another weekend could be of value.

If this is deemed advisable it is suggested that SA RICHARD A. DYER

Tacoma RA make the necessary arrangements and it is felt that some

of the Seattle agents

assigned to the search on foot could benefit

greatly from observation of the search in order to familiarize

themselves with problems encountered and terrain to be searched,

Dear General Surles:

SUB:

Un November 24, 1971, an unidentifled individual held

up and hijacked Northwost Airlines Flight 405 between Portland,

119771190S

Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, and on landing in Seattle

extorted $200,000 from the Northwest Airlines.

He departed via

the same plane with the crew from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport,

and investigation by the FBI to date has developed information

that more than likoly this individual left the airplane via

parachute in the vicinity of La Center, Washington.

Our further investigation has developed that very likely

he came down in an area of approximately three and one-half miles

wide by six miles long. Thus far, in spite of extensive nation-

wide investigation we have developed no information that any of

the money has

turned up nor have we developed any information to

indicate that the individual successfully completed the jump and

escaped alive.

In view of the area to be searched and the magnitude

of the problen, we request the assignment of a Conpany of ground

troops together with support in order to search the terrain for

the individual's body.

Hopefully, if the assistance is to be

extendod the troops would be on location on or about March 14, 1972,

ready to commence the operation on March 15, 1972.

Should you render assistance and desire further

details concerning the actual site and operation these can

be

secured through Special Agent in Charge J.E. Milnes, 1015

On March 10, 1972, I had an exchange of telephone

calls with

Presidio, California, concerning our request of the Amy in

this matter.

I told|

that we had informally contacted

the office of Legal Counsel at

the Army Headquarters in

Washington, D. C., who, in turn, had informally contacted

Undersecretary of the Army; both advised that they saw no

objections to the Army assisting in this matter.

initially suggested that the request

be formalized at Washington, D. C.; however, as a result of

our conversation I volunteered to have a formal letter of

request addressed to him from our San Francisco Office

concerning this matter.

I then dictated such a letter to the SAC's secretary

in San Francisco for delivery to the Staff Duty Officer at the

Presidio today (March 10).

Ine search area has been divided with 6 agents

working specific sections.

They will contact all individuals

living on property in their assigned area, attempting to

secure walver from these people who have a propertyinterest.

In event they find no one at home at any of the locations,

they will make a proper notation on a wavier form, setting

forth the description of the property, and will either go

back to attempt to contact or as an alternative wait until

the search starts and then contact the person prior to going on

the lang.

If a person refuses to..execute a consent form,

then we will advise them that we will get a search warrant

and conduct-a search on that basis.

If we find a company ownership listed for any of

the property, whether it be state, local or U. S. Government,

or private enterprise, we are not going to contact anyone at

those

locations since they will probably be workmen. If it is felt

to be necessary to make contact with the company, or the

state in these cases,

we will take steps to contact headquarters

of the various companies for the property wavier.

If the agents working on the securing of the waiver

are in' a town, and there are several of these towns in the

search area,

they will not go house to house in the town

unless the house nas a large amount of property on which

it stands.

The agents are staging at the Quay Motel in

SUBJECT: NORJAK

On 2/11/72 I talked to SAC WILLIAMS in Sacramento

about the Air Force photographing the area, where the hijacker

is supposed to have landed.

He advised that they endeavored to

take the pictures on 2/4/72 and again on 2/11/72 but due to

cloud cover were unable to obtain the photographs. They will

unable to? and

continue their efforts in this regara.

He advised that the photograph when deveoped will be

about 25 ft. long and requires special equipment to read it.

This is

being done as a training mission at no cost to the

Bureau.

the military has the best equipment,.

military be polled to determine if they would take the

aeria. pictures and what it would cost us. In addition, in

talking to them determine if it's possible for them to take

the pictures and give the film to us for developing as a

means of reducing the cost.

I told him that we had initially arranged for the

Air Force to do it.

Then when the Bureau came out with the

airtel advising that we must get the cost estimate first

and get Bureau approval before utilizing Air Force equipment

that we discontinued this effort. However, I now find that

the Air Force had scheduled to take this picture on

2/17/72.

I told him I would explore this further and be in

search.

After checking he saidthey were going to do it;

they had the map of the area and the first good day

when the light was right, they vould do it. It would not

take long after that that the photos could be studied and

analysed, the thought it would be only a few days that

we would

have the results.) We will be advisea.

I called the Bureau and talked to HENRY SHUTZ.

I told him that the SAC had wanted him to know the reason

we had not come in with a request in connection with a

terrain search of the suspect drop area, was that we felt it

would be well to have an aerial reconnaissance. I furnished

him the information set out above. He said that he understood

Re: SEARCIL ARBA

On 1/10/72 after having received the new plotting

writer telephonically contacted

Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis.

advised that his computations based

on the results of the experimental flight on 1/6/12, coupled

with updated Intormation furnished by

of the U.S. Air Force at McChord AFB, he had prepared a

revised plotting of the course of the aircraft as well as a

probable jump area.

A memo prepared by

which he also had prepared,

been received and during

the telephone conversation

advised that in his

judgment, the best possible spot to search for the subject

would be

at point A and proceeding Irom there to Point

on the map.

memo adequately explains the lines

drawn on the map and are therefore not further being

explained.

said he feels that the hijacker is more

apt to be found south of line A & & than north of the line

and more apt to be in the western part of the possible

area than in the eastern part.

As a result of talking with

the writer drew arc's emanating from Point A down to a

point on line G thru K.

the arc's were extended along

lines A-B and down to the same aforementioned line G-K.

It was his feeling that this would be the most fruitful

нев. с

the next choice would be a continuation of the

arc's to the north of line A-B also to line G thru k.

The arc's drawn on the southern portion from lines

A-B are in solid felt marker pen and

Once the

search date is fixed

thismatter be made a Special

with the four California offices, Portland and Seattle to furnish

four or five agents to participate in the search on a volunteer

basis.

The voluntary aspect is being emphasized in view of the terrain

to be searched and the uncomfortable conditions which will undoubtedly

be experienced by the searching personnel.

It is recommended that volunteers be sought from individuals

who have some,and preferably extensive, experience in the use of a

compass and hiking and camping experience and who are physically

qualified to spend a period of time in a densely wooded area on what

is essentially a problem similar to a military field exercise.

It is further recommended that the agent personnel assigned

be cognizant of the fact that once the operation starts they will be

required to remain overnight in their assigned searching areas rather

the to ane from

than retracing areas covered to go to and from a base camp.

A list of recommended items to be secured for logistic support

of this special is being prepared by the writer the majority of

which can be secured from the Army or the Navy at little or no cost

to the Bureau..

Aerial photographs of the search area as set forth by the

SA WICK is securing, in addition to the photos, detailed maps made from

complete familiarization with the search area as it existed in 1968.

It was pointed out by the Bureau of Natural Resources that there should

be no major radical changes in the area since the last fly over.

SA WICK was advised to purchase the photographs and it is felt the

expenditure of the money for the photos and maps will not exceed

$50 and in view of the magnitude and importance of the search is

a legitimate expenditure of Bureau funds.

The above mentioned maps are being sent to the Longview RA

sum could probably be negotiated to a lower amount on a daily basis.

Re: SEARCH

U.S. AIR FORCI SR-71 AIRCRAFT

Sacramento Division in a teletype dated

12/3/71 (Ser. 550) advised that Beale AFB, California,

had offered, free of charge to the Bureau, use of an

SR-71 aircraft to photograph terrain over which

the hijacked airplane had flown on its trip to Reno.

This aircraft was described as an extremely

sophisticated aerial reconnaissance plane which woula

photograph a strip 20 miles wide with photographic resolution

of detecting objects on the ground 2 feet square. The

film strip would then be reviewed by trained and qualified

U.S. Air Force personnel.

Due to weather conditions along the route, being

Inclement at times, the flight never was made.

On 1/10/72 the writer contacted SAC JOHN WILLIAMS,

Sacramento, and explained the results of the experiment

on 1/6/72.

MI. WILLIAMS was requested to have the Air

Force contacted to see if the flight could be made only

over the State of Washington and perhaps fron the Columbia

River to a point some 30 miles north. He was also asked

if the Air Force could advise what we could expect of such

an over flight in the way of information which would be

helpful in the search of this terrain.

In response to the above call, SA

who has been handling the hijacking case at

Sacramento,

advised he had contacted Beale AFE and made the request

for the over flight and that no would attempt to determinen

if it could be made, noting

that weather conditions still

Dato 21/26/71

On this date, the below listed individuals examined

a Boeing

; Aircraft, Type 727, which belongs-to Northwest Orient

Airlines, and which had been utilized as their flight number 305

on that date. This examination took place at 11:25 P.M. at the

Municipal Airport in Reno, Nevada.

Prior to the initiation of this search, information had

been furnished to the below agents by a member of

the crew

who had flown this airplane into the Reno airport to the effect

that the unknow subject involved in the hi-jacking of this

airplane had been seated in the rear right-hand window seat

of this plane.

Upon boarding this aircraft, it was determined that the

rear row of seats on this airplane were numbered 18, and the

right window seat was designated 18F. On the seat numbered 18D

a black clip-on tie was observed. This black tie contained a

tie clasp, yellow gold in color. with a white pearl circular

stone in the

The label on this tie indicated it to be

a "Toncraft" the and bore the store name of Penneys Number 3.

It further bore a label showing it to be a

"Snapper" patent type

tie.

On the floor directly in front of seat number 18D, the

exterior canvas cover for a chest type parachute was observed

...along with the handle utilized for releasing this parachute.

The label on this canvas covering indicated it to be Pack Part

Number 4511876B and indicated the date of manufacture to have

been October, (year illegible). The flap on this canvas exterior

contained a sewn on white label with the notation SSS # 5 and

COSS. This flap had also been stenciled with the name JOHNSON.

.

An opened parachute which apparently had been removed

from the canvas parachute cover described above was round spread

out over seats 17C and 173. This parachule was of a pink-orange

color.

on seat 1oß, an unopened back type parachute was

observed. A card in the pocket of this parachute reflected it

to be a Conacol, type parachute, number 60-9707 and made by the

Pioneer Parachute Company.

On 12/20/71 I talked to SAC HELD in Minneapolis.

I told him that we had made extensive efforts to search the

area where the hijacker is believed to have jumped, without

discovering any evidence of his whereabouts or identity.

3

The Northwest Airlines people here have advised

that they would be glad to simulate his flight, having a

man jump to see whether the crew experienced the same

reaction as recorded on the initial flight, and if the

flight recorder records the same movement of the plane.

If it did not, then it would appear that there was little use

searching in the area we were searching in.

If it did have

the same reaction,

then we would have to search an area

approximately 24 miles by 6 miles of virgin timber.

I told SAC HELD I thought it would be well if

possible to have the same airplane used with the same crew

but I did not see any reason for them to actually jump in

the same area since it would be too dangerous and we may

lose the jumper, but I did think it woud be a good idea to

simulate it in an area where the jumper could be recovered.

He advised he had taked to Mr. NYROP about this

and that he had instructed that the crew and plane be put

together for this purpose as soon as possible.

that the Seattle P-I Secret Witness Program had announced

a $5,000 reward, which was true, and that he would give

• consideration

to making another $5,000 offer for information

furnished to Northwest Airlines or the FBI, furnishing

identity of the hijacker and evidence to assist in his

conviction.

The attached information was taken primarily Exom

manually recorded notes during communications con-

nected with the high-jacking of Northwest Airlines

Flight 305, November 24/25, 1971.

The primary method of communication with the flight

was direct between MSPFO (Flight Operations) and

SLADD (Flight Dispatch), the flight, SEl and SPO

that the aircraft configuration must be gear DOIN, flaps at.

15º, that the aft entry door must be open at all times, and

that the aft stairs be extended after take-off. Later speci-

fied that stairs must be fully extended before tale-off.

MSPFO advised crew (1) that non-stop StA-ilX impossible with

gear DOWN, flaps 15º, (2) that take-off with air-stairs full

down impossible due to inability to rotate airplane. Then

tiJ advised of this he asked

That air-stairs be partially ex-

since stairs could not be held in any interediate position.

ary information on optimum range IS (170K), weather, air-

roplied that it was. This was appatently the last communi

cation the crew had with the l:j.

Enclosed for each office is one artist's conception

or the captioned subject.

The Bureau is preparing a circular

for field-wide circularization concerning captioned

case and

will include an artist's conception of the hijacker. The Bureau

has been asked to prepare a sketch

showing the unknown subject

without glasses.

Additional distribution will be made from

time to time to parachute clubs, flight instruction schools and

airports, etc., in an effort to identify the unknown subject

which undoubtedly will result in various field divisions receiving

calls on this case.

For the assistance of all offices in conducting

investigation anâ to evaluate complaints from citizens, the

following information is furnished:

The unknown subject boarded captioned flight at

Portland, Oregon, using the name DAN COOPER. As the plane

was taxiing toward the runway, Stewardess

occupied the seat reserved for the stewardesses on the right

side of the plane and behind the last row of passenger seats.

The unknown subject, who occupied the center seat in the last

row of three seats, turned and handed her an envelope

which she did not open for a few minutes until he glanced

at ner several times.

She then opened the envelope and read

the enclosed note which said: "Miss - I have a bomb here

and I would like you to sit by me."

advised he believes he talked to a man who closely

resembles the subject during July or August 1911 Based upon

his conversation with this individual he strongly suspects

the man may be the person connected with this crime.

recalled that he talked to this man for

approximately ten to fifteen minutes concerning different

aspects of parachute jumping and during this conversation

the man asked several unusual questions, such as how would

one go about jumping out of jets.

_specifically

recalls telling the man it could be done if the door of the

aircraft opened inward or if it had a rear stairwell that

could be raised and lowered.

The man appeared interested

and they discussed this further, to the point where air

speed and drag was talked about.

The fact was brought up

that full flaps and lowered landing gear would supply the

drag needed to exit from a jet.

The man also asked

each person that jumps must fill out a registration card/before

jumping, regardless of how much prior experience the person has

These cards are maintained at Elsinore Paricenter,

On succeeding jumps, the cards are referred to if the individual

is not known,

and a receipt for jump tickets is given to the

Jumper with no name or further recording of the jump being made.

nished the following information:

Concerning the individual he talked to sometime during

July or August 1971, who

]believes could be identical to

the subject that hijacked the Northwest Airlines aircraft on

November 24, 1971, he recalled that the man he talked to must

have been a

smoker of Raleigh Cigarettes because he observed

Raleigh coupons in the man's possession and remarked to him that

he smoked those cigarettes with the coupons and could save enough

to buy a "p. C."

', meaning Para-Commander type parachute, the

kind used by parachute enthusiasts and most sport jumpers.

Jadvised he recalled this while studying the

Government memorandum containing the description of the man who

hijacked the aircraft on November 24, 1971. He further advised

that he doubted that the man he talked to belonged to any para-

chute or jumping clubs inasmuch as the average age of jumpers

is between 25 to 28 years and they would not hang around with an

"Old guy like that"

• and too because most clubs in California

have disbanded in the last year and a half.

Concerning clubs and their locations,

advised

that they could be identified through the U, S. Parachute Asso-
