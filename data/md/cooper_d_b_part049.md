and advised that COOPER was arrested on 2/6/59 for

probation violation and issuing worthless checks; 6/24/60 for

issuing worthless checks; and again on 2/4/61 fox two counts of

issuing worthless checks. At the time of his 2/4/61 arrest,

of these reports indicates COOPER, in addition to writing

worthless checks, was wanted for non-support in LaCrosse,

Wisconsin. No information is contained in the records identifying

any of COOPER'S relatives.

COOPER did serve one year at the

Wisconsin State Penitentiary at Waupun, Wisconsin.

on 5/19/88, a review of birth records at the Wisconsin

COOPER was born 7/8/34 to SILAS BYRON COOPER and ORPHA GRIFFIN

Mrs. COOPER spoke fondly of her son, but admitted

that he was "kind of a con man", having served time in the

Oregon State Penitentiary in 1966-67 for bad Checks. She has

saved the two letters MERLIN had written her in addition to

two swim awards he won early in life.

With the exception of

two phone calls she received the week before his death, Mrs.

COOPER had no contact with MERLIN.

Mrs. COOPER allowed the

Bureau to have the enclosed letter for laboratory tests on

the condition it would be returned when it was no longer

needed.

The letter is addressed to ORPHA COOPER and is

On 8/2/88, ORPHA COOPER was interviewed concerning

ner son, MERLIN COOPER. Contrary to other reports, Mrs

COOPER denied that she was close to her son. However,

He stated that shortly after the takeoff from Seattle Airport

he went outside his residence and watched for low flying aircraft.

He stated that sometime after the takeoff, he heard a aircraft

flying very low over his residence and then cross the Columbia

River and continue heading in

a southerly direction. L

went on to explain that the aircraft flying south from the

Seattle Airport routinely flew directly over his property in

the Camas/Washougal area of Washington. He feels that because

of the flight path of the airplane it may be possible that

Mr. D.B. COOPER had parachuted from the aircraft and landed

the Columbia River adjacent to his residence.

He felt that

this would explain the money being discovered sometime later

down river.l

Iconcern was that the search for

subject's body in the Columbia River has been taking place

too far west, he feels that it should be conducted in an area

which would be in direct line, if you were to draw a line on

killer suspect infamous D.B. Cooper?

Associated Press

SEATTLE - An FBI

agent

who investigated the D.B.

Cooper skyjacking said Friday

there are a number of similarities

between

Cooper and a man

recently arrested in an 18-year-

old New Jersey multiple murder

case.

Ralph Himmelsbach,

who

retired in 1980, said Friday that

he belieges "Cooper" died when

he parachuted from a Goeing 727

over

southwest

Washington

1971 with $200,000 in

ransom.

But Himmelsbach, who led the

Cooper investigation,

still

believes John E. List should be

investigated.

"I

would

say he's a major

suspect or, at least, 1 would

consider him a major suspect,"

Himmelsbach said.

As a fugitive after the killings

of five members of his family,

List was considered a suspect in

the skyjacking

from

the

beginning, Himmelsbach said:

Descriptions

of List

and

Cooper are similar. Both are

between the two men.

A

man police said is List was

DB Cooper-20481

arrested June 1 in Richmond,

Va., after the

television show "America's Most Wanted" ran a

program on the "ballroom murders" in November

1973, List's wife, his 87-year-old mother and his

three children

were

shot to death

in their

Westfield, N.J., mansion.

The man, who goes by the name Robert P. Clark

and was described by friends as a quiet, church-

going accountant, was extradited to New Jersey on

Thursday and in jail.

Although the man known as Clark denies he is

List, authorities said fingerprints and a scar prove

Clark and List are the same man.

Authorities said List fled to Colorado and then

Virginia and had built a new life.

FBI

spokesman

John Eyer in Seattle said

Thursday that List was being investigated in the

skyjacking, but said it was routine.

David Baugh, List's lawyer in Richmond before

he was returned to New Jersey, compared the

alleged connection to reported sightings of Elvis

Presley.
