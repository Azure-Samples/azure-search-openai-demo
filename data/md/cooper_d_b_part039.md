was deer hunting on or about October 23, 1976, about

and saw a movement in the trees.

He said he

thought he saw a deer and approached the area, only to notice

a pair of pants hanging in the trees. He said it was about

25 feet from the ground and the pants were covered with leaves

and fir tree needles.

He continued that

he obtained a long

stick and removed the pants from the branch it was resting on

and examined the pockets looking for identification. He said

the pockets were empty so he left the pants in the trees.

pointed out he did not think too much about

the pants only that they did not appear to be pants that a

logger or possibly a hunter would discard in the woods.

He said

in his 40 years in

the woods he never saw pants hanging from

a tree that height from the ground before. He said he read

some of

the recent articles about D.B. COOPER and thought the

pants might be important in that investigation:

The following outline is the result of many hours of research

by

and we be-

live that this information will lead to the arrest and conviction

of "Dan B. Cooper", and the return of the money taken.

Dan B. Coopers "ILLUSIONS"

A. The public and the FBI believe the following:

1. On November 24, 1971 Northwest Orient flight 305 left

Washington DC for Portland Oregon, then Seattle Washington.

2. Shortly before landing in Seattle a note was given to

a stewardess to relay the following information to thé pilot

a. I have a bomb in my briefcase:

b. Do the following: Relay I will exchange all 36 passengers

for $200,000 in twenty dollar bills, and l parachutes.

3. All the passengers, plus 2 stewardesses were released in

exchange for the above.

•. .

• I. Money and chutes on board, Cooper positively identified

as being on board the aircraft - Aircraft now lifts off.

a. 8 fighter jets now tail the aircraft at slow speel, with

the door in the tail section of the aircraft open, all the way

to Reno Nevada.

1. All the fighter pilots report that no one left the aircraft

b. The aircraft now lands, FBI agents and police engulf the

aircraft and are convinced that Cooper did not get off the aircraft

in "Reno Nevada.

c. Lodigicol assumption is to assume that Cooper had to

parachut off the aircraft between Seattle and Reno Nevada.

He stated that they

would clearly state in

and was not the actual tapes obtained at the time of the

hijacking and would only use

certain portions of the trans-

cripts.

I told

Ithat I felt that I could not let

him see the transcripts inasmuch as they were transcribed

not from the original tapes, but from tapes dubbed off the

originals as the original would be used as evidence in court

and some of the transcriptions were not clear and the

transcripts

were only being used for investigative purposes.

I told him I felt that this

could possibly jeopardize the

case and

prior to letting him see

the transcripts would have

to clear it with FBIHQ.

I then telephonically contacted

Exter-

transcripts and the reason and he concurred.

was then advised I would be unable to

furnish

him with this information or allow him to see the

transcripts.

He stated he understood the reasoning behind

this.

also requested that the names of the banks

who furnished the

$200,0.00 be furnished him so he

could

All Norjak eyewitnesses have been repeatedly

contacted and have viewed countless photographs.

Up to

now, they have been extremely cooperative notwithstanding

the many contacts they have endured both at work and at

home.

Because of the length of time that has passed

between the occurrence of Norjak and the present, the

validity of these persons witness value has decreased.

Based on the above these witnesses will not be

contacted to view photographs unless there is no other

way to eliminate a suspect.

URSUSERS FOUND IN AMBOX, WASHINGTON

11/23/76

SUB 858

-

On 1/17/77, a check was made with several laundries

that specialize in martinizing in the Seattle area, and it

was learned

that laundry tickets are customarily stapled to

trousers and other items as they are received from the customer

for cleaning.

The number and letters on these tickets correspond

with a code which is a sequential numbering system. • The first

character in the code is an alphabetic letter and the second

character in the code. is a number, ranging from 1 to 10,000.

When a customer brings in an item for cleaning,

such as a pair of trousers, he fills out a cleaning form

requesting cleaning and putting his name on the form. The

date of pickup and

the cross reference. number also appears

on this form. The number on the form could be A-l through

10,000 and a corresponding tag would then be stapled to

the trousers with that number A-1 through 10, 000, so that

the trousers could be located in the event the customer

does not show up to claim his cleaning items.

Most laundries vary the first letter from A-1 through

10,1000 to B-1 through 10, 000, etc., until the end of the year,

at which time they normally start over again with A-l through

10,000; however, this is not a hard and fast rule and with

just a

number such as found on the trousers in this case,

• A-317, it would be impossible to determine who the customer

was who had the trousers cleaned. It might be possible in

some cleaning establishments to determine the customer if

the trousers were recently cleaned by checking past ticket

receipts, but this would not guarantee that the customer

would indeed be the customer that dropped those trousers

off in that the numbers are repeated over and over again

on a sequential basis.

In addition, cleaning establishments do not save

their records in a uniform

manner as one establishment may

save records for five years,

for three or four months.

another may only save records

Finally it was learned that most laundry cleaning

establishments use this system and therefore, it would be

impractical to contact all the laundries either

specializing

in martinizing or not specializing in martinizing, in the

State of Washington, and possibly even in the State of Oregon,

to determine the owner of the trousers.

It is felt that

this lead would be unproductive and because of the measurement

size, that of a waistband of 42" and an inseam of 31", and

because of the fact that it does not appear that the

trousers were in the wooded area for a five-year period, no

further investigation concerning this aspect of the case

will be conducted at this time.

he was very smart and mentally capable of committing the

he moved to Germany shortly after the hijacking incident.

She noted

of the hijacking and indicated that L

was on vacation

somewhere in the United States; however, she had no idea as

to his whereabouts on November 24, 1971, and could not positively

state that he was even in the United States at that time. She

also had no knowledge of his having any experience with para-

chuting and she believed he had never been in the military.

She did note that he has traveled extensively throughout the

country and speaks foreign languages.

I felt that

most incriminating factor concerning l

that he has done so much traveling abroad and yet appears to

have no employment or source of income with the exception of

his home, which he sold in Toronto:

She identified COFFELT as having been employed

as a used furniture salesman on an intermittent basis from

approximately 1963 to 1970.

COFFELT worked on a commission

basis and on occasion he would leave from work without

notice and return some months later saying he had taken

a medical course somewhere in the Midwest. She said

hired COFFELT back because he was a smooth

talker and a good

She was unaware of any of COFFELT's private life,

NORJACK

00: SEATTLE

ReButelcal to Seattle 3/30/77.

Enclosed for Seattle are Xerox copies of missing

person index cards which generally fit the description of

captioned unsub.

In connection with captioned investigation it was

suggested by the Criminal

Investigative Division that a

manual search of the missing persons indices be conducted

here at FBIHQ Identification Division. Approximately 5200

cards containing information regarding missing persons

were reviewed in an effort to identify logical suspects who

were reported as missing at about the time the hijacking

occurred. Identification Division personnel were furnished

a composite description of Dan Cooper and as a result

the below listed white males were developed as suspects.

Each of the individuals were reported as missing during latter

1971 or 1972.

This search was based upon the presumption that

unsub may have perished during the jump from the aircraft

and that some relative somewhere may have filed a missing

person report.

RE: NORJACK

In addition, Xerox cards of the folloving six

individuals are being furnished to Seattle:

There

is limited information on the Xerox cards which may be

beneficial to the office of origin in setting forth leads.

It is suggested that Seattle obtain photographs

of the missing persons reported above, either from police

lepartments or through contact with relatives for display to

witnesses if similarities

are noted. It is also suggested

that the artist's conception of Cooper be displayed to the

relatives of these individuals to determine if there are

any similarities.

Advise Bureau of results.

ReButelcal to Seattle 3/30/77.

Enclosed for Seattle are Xerox copies of missing

person index cards which generally fit the description of

captioned unsub.

In connection with captioned investigation it was

suggested by the Criminal Investigative Division that a

manual search of the missing persons indices be conducted

here at FBIHQ Identification Division. Approximately 5200

cards containing information regarding missing persons

occurred. Identification Division personnel were furnished

with a composite

description of Dan Cooper and as a result

the below listed

white males were developed as suspects.

Each of the individuals were reported as missing during latter

1971 or 1972.

This search was based upon the presumption that

unsub may have perished during the jump from the aircraft.

and that some relative somewhere may have filed a missing

person report.

There

It is suggested that Seattle obtain photographs

of the missing persons reported above, either from police

witnesses if similarities are noted. It is also suggested

that the artist's conception of Cooper be displayed to the
