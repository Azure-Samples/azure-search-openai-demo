SUGGESTIONS FROM SEARCH AND RESCUE DOG PERSONNEL FOR EQUIPMENT AND

SEARCH TECHNIQUES -

Every searcher to have leather gloves and wateroroof shoes

Use toilet paper for marking extremities of each grid and use skirmish

line with no more than 5' foot intervals betwech searchers in heavily

wooded areas.

Then at extremity of search grid entire line can be swing

around using one grid extremity marked by paper as guide for next grid.

Paper will disintegrate after short time in elements.

Terrain is very difficult with windfall and alders in profusion in

area near point A.

Very slow movement of the line is advised with

all personnel instructed to look up as they search

. as well as on

ground.

Recontend no more than six hours

of search per day.

10 minute breaks

every hour and no more than 30 minute break for lunch with field

rations.

164-81-2035

Recommend supplying each searcher with candy bars on daily basis to

give quick pickup and replenish calorie use which is approximately

600 calories per hour in heavy wooded area. It is reconmended that

FBI supply these items which can be secured wholesale through contact

at Longview.

Recomnend one may on the line have a compass to shoot bearings to

keep grid intact.

Recommend several

agents behind the skirmish line to insure that

Line maintains itself straight with no straggling.

It was pointed out that there is heavy concentration of coyotèss

which gives distinct possibility that if hijacker did hit the ground

his body could be completely stripped of flesh and clothing.

In event a man with a dog is required

charge is $175 per day if

to be used

exclusively on the search.

Suggest if Army is approved that a

basic training company in last

stages of training be employed due to good physical condition.

suggest skirmish line have

smoke grenades in event one of searchers

evacuation is necessary by helicopter. Will guide

evacuation helicopter to scene with no delay.

On steep places encountered these could be skirted and searched with

field glasses since in most steep places there is little growth of

foliage and trees.

3/17/72

DATE:

JUD

SUBJECT:

NORJAK

Assistant Director BATES called from Divison6. He

said that they had a call from the Public Affairs Officer

of the Army.

The Army is sending out to their Public Affairs

officers in the field certain questions and answers which they

anticipate using in connection with publicity in regard

to the search.

Question 1:

Is the Army assisting the FBI in its

search for a sky jacker?

Answer:

At the request of

the FBI approximately 200 U.S. Army troops from Ft. Lewis

are assisting in the

search

for a sky jacker, believed to

have parachuted in the vicinity of Portland, oregon, on

the 24th of November 1971.

There is a possibizity this

sky jacker could have died in his jump.

(The Bureau suggested

to the Army that they change Portland to LaCenter, Washington)

Question No. 2 relates purely to the justification for

the U.S. Army, which is supposed to be defending this country,

being used in a situation like this and in answer to it the

Army saidlthey feel it is justified since th it came at

the request of

a responsible government agency and is related

to their training program.

BATES did not give me this verbatim since we would not

be concerned with it.

Thax No. 3 is another Army question which raises

is such support legal and the Army answer is Yes.

BATES suggests that we make, no comment other than to

say, Yes, the Army is assisting us in the search and we

have no further comment.

FROM : SA J. ROBERT SUTTHOPE

SUBJECT: NORJAK

DATE: 3/29/72

At approximately 2:30 PM our time I talked to

SA HENRY SCHUTZ from the Bureau.

search situation.

He also advised it will be necessary to get a

"good" teletype off to the Bureau tonight relative to the

discontinuance of the search for the time being. This tele-

type should generally point out that the Army has withdrawn its

troops, that the search has been arduous and physically

exhausting and that the troops are being withdrawn primarily

to give them some rest; also in view of the approaching

holiday weekend.

It should point out that agents have been

with the troops

throughout the search and that the agents

involved also have undergone an arduous and tiring experience

and can use rest too. It should point out that UACB

agents from the nearby offices at least will be released to

return to their offices, and that either the same agents

or replacements for them will rejoin the search with the

Army troops at whatever time this resumption of the search

is established.

RE: SEARCH & PUBLICITY

At 12:15 PM, on 4/6/72,

Ft. Lewis, Washington, telephone

advised that it was his intention

if FBI approval is given, to make a "low keyed response"

to the press to the effect that "we are resuming the

search in the south."

advised that, since the movement of

troops and helicopters from Ft. Lewis to the Vancouver area,

would generate press inquiries" he planned to contact the

press on his own iniative, possibly on 4/7/72, to advise them of

the above.

Jadvised that the Department of the Army had

given its approval and felt that the previous search had

been an excellent training vehicle.

was advised that any clearance would

have to come from SAC MILNES who was unavailable at the time

and he reguested that when Mr. MILNES was available that

be contacted at the

above telephone numbers.

After discussing this with Mr. MILNES I called

back and said that this was satisfactory.

Richand Floyd Me Cry he.

On 4/10/72 I called SAC CALAME at Salt Lake City

and advised him that in examining the photograph of the

subject of the SALJAK case, it appeared that he had a striking

resemblance to the subject

of the NORJAK case.

I asked him

to forward photographs of the subject to us immediately, to

Portland and Minneapolis, for display to the witnesses and

to establish the whereabouts of McCOY during the pertinent

period.

Sale

3014-108

SAC CALAME called me back and advised that in

examining the material obtained during their investigation,

they have determined that McCOY is a makeup artist.

One of

the stewardesses in their case described the subject as being

swarthy or dark or possibly a mexican.

He had a dark mustache.

However, they have located some mustache paste in his effects.

In addition, they have determined that using the

name of R. MCCOY, which is his name, he made a flight fron

Salt Lake City to

O Denver and the same flicht from Denver

to Los Angeles one week earlier on the same airlines.

The similarities in the SALJAK and NORJAK cases

are striking in that in both cases he asked for 2 back packs

and 2 chest pack parachutes. In addition, he requested the

UAL, to give him his own luggage from the plane's

before they departed, and his own parachute and jump suit,

helmet and flares, together with 100 ft. of rope in his luggage.

SACCALAME speculates that the subject in the SALJAK case

tied the money in his other effects, together, and when he

was ready to leave the plane let them descent first, hung onto

the rope, just before he landed dropped them and he could make

the landing safely.

In addition, he dropped 2 parachutes which

they have not located.

One parachute was located in Nevada

and one near where he landed in Utah. The whereabouts of the

other chutes are unknown.

164-81-2640

SAC CALAME is causing a check to be made of the UAL

flights from Salt Lake City to Portland or Seattle for two weeks

prior to 11/24/71.

We should immediately commence inquiry to

determine if an individual using the name of either DAN COOPER lov

D. COOPER, R. MCCOY Or RICHARD MCCOY made a flight from Portlalton

to Seattle on NW flight 405 2 weeks prior to 11/24/71

On 4/12/72 I called SA HENRY SCHUTZ at the Bureau.

I advised lim that the 3 stewardess witnesses in

Minneapolis had observed the photograph of RICHARD FLOYD

MCCOY and advised that he was not identical with the NORJAK

subject.

I told him that one witness here had observed certain

similarities between the photograph of MaCOY and the NORJAK

subject; however, this witness,

said that if

McCOY were wearin a wig and had cosmetic makeup, it would

change his complexion to a darker shade and there would be

more similarity.

Witness

advised that after viewing the

photograph of mccoy, he would eliminate Mccoy as a suspect

in NORJAK.

He did say there were facial similarities but

based on the photograph displayed to him of McCOY, he would

be eliminated as a suspect.

A 3rd witness here was unable to identify McCOY as

the subject of NORJAK.

I told Me. SCHurz that in spite of this, in view of

the obvious similarity in the two cases, together with the

apparent similarities of MCCOY's photograph to that of the

artist's sketch, I thought we should immediately establish

positively his whereabouts during the pertinent period through

independent witnesses, and that we would continue the investi-

gation endeavoring to

determine if McCOY had made a pre-

hijacking flight from Salt take City to Portland and return

and/or from Portland to Seattle and return.

I advised him later some time today we would send him

a teletype concerning this matter.

has previously been

interviewed extensively on this case and several possibilites

disuessed with him. He had no suspects.

It is noted that lead in this airtel is to identify a parachutist

who jumps in the water because of a disabling accident and one can

assume this chutist is somewhat imobile. It is believed that the

hijacker in this case has full use of all of his extremities and

witnesses did not tell of any physical disability. It is noted that

the person they want us to identify is in a wheel

chair.

A man confined to a wheel chair did

not hijack the plane in this

case.

Chronicle and gave same story.

It appears the call was from a prankster or someone seeking

to confuse the issue.

On 3/31/72, Spokane Chronicle

ladvised the writer that the individual came in person to the

office that morning and gave substantially the same

story and said he wanted 20% of the loot. He declined to identity

himself but

said he looked and acted like an ex-con, I

guedded him

to be about 30, fairly clean and polite but somewhat

arrogant. Saád he insisted

on dealing with newspaper so he could

enforce any promise not to be prosecuted.

Individual told

that there are

five other peoples who know where

the money is. Amount involved is

$491,000. He said there were three persons who stole a station wagon

and the noney was in it. They don't know where it came from. They

found a paper folder that had held an airplane ticket so they figured

it night have come fron a highjacking. The individual stated that

three guys

stole the vehicle that had

the money in it. They are

"heavy" theedes and have relatives here. He figures if they are

sicked up, they will think the relatives fingered them and not the

san talking.

After leaving the Chronicle office, the man called by phone

and said he would send in 12 of the bills to be checked; that he had

of the money himself. He promised to dend the money in right

away.

felt that if they got anything in the mail it

would be and April Fool letter. Neither of them, nor the Spokane R/A,

have heard from the individual since.

Re SA THOMAS IS MANNING memo dated 4/9/72.

On 4/1000 the writer of this memo contacted

Washington, at

which time she provided the following

infornation:

advised that the day after Thanksgiving,

1971,

she and her husband were travelling on a forestry road

Washington, where they were looking for a

Christmas tree to cut,

at which time she noticed fresh tire

tracks in the snow.

further advised that she did

not know if the tire tracks in the snow tied in with the

Norjak investigation, but that she thought that she should

bring it to the attention of the FBI.

She further provided a Forest Service map, which

revealed the location where she had seen the tire tracks

in the snow.

It was noted that a Forest Service road ex-

tends from where

Isaw the tire tracks to the general

are a

Dam. however, it was also noted that the

general area where l

saw the tire tracks was honeycombed

with Forest Service roads,

revealing that the vehicle that

made the. tire tracks could have been driven fron any number

of locations, including_

Washington, which is wast

of

Because the tire tracks in the snow that

observed do not appear to tie directly into the Norjak

investigation, no further investigation is being conducted.

on the 727, the rear stairs cannot be lowered from

They can be lowered only from the

passenger compartment in the rear of the plane or externally

if the plane is on the ground.

advised that once the operation of the rear

stairs has started there is no way to stop them until they

have extended to the full position. On the ground when the

rear stairs are extended, the weight of the stairs actually

carries them to the full open position. If the stairs are

extended in flight,

the pressure of the wind keeps them from

opening to the full position.

On several occasions

extended the rear stairs while in righe

Whis was done at speeds of approximately 150 knots. Opening

the rear stairs in flight at speeds at 150 to 170 knots would

not suck any items from the passenger cabin.

There would be

a slight change in pressurization but this would not remove

any papers or cushions from the passenger cabin.
