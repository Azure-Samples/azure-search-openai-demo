BUFILE 164-2111

Enclosed are four (4) artists composites,

two black and white, and two color, depicting the

NORJAK unsub with and without glasses.

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient Flight #305 at Portlara,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en

route to Seattle,

Washington, he indicated

to the stewardess that his brief case contained

a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines complied with

his instructions.

After he received the parachutes

and

money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and

the

two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a southerly

direction and fly at a low altitude and slow speed

which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where

the plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the

hijacker, two parachutes, and the ransom money had

disappeared when the plane was inspected at Reno,

Nevada.

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 1-76

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 15, 1976

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS

₴

RE: COMPUTER SUPPORT TO THE FIELD

The main thrust of our computer support effort in the past has been directed at administrative

and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) matters. It is now my desire to concentrate more on ways

our computers can support the Agent in the Field. This is to make you aware of the computer services

The Data Processing Section (DPS) of the Computer Systems Division is responsible for

working with the Field on investigative matters. Agents with specialized backgrounds have been assigned

to this Section and will assist you if some aspect of a case lends itself to computerization. This might be

a large volume of records (e. g., checks, cash receipts, purchase orders, personnel records, payroll

records, telephone numbers, ete.) that require sequencing, comparing or calculating, to disclose

misappropriations, kiting, lapping, skimming, padding of payrolls, identities of suspects, conspiracies,

etc. If you think the work can be performedmere-practically. the computer you should contact the

DPS.

The DPS also offers assistance in the following areas:

1. Printing records that are in computer form (e.g., records on computer tapes,

disks or cards).

2. Assistance in writing search warrants for, and conducting searches of, computer

installations.

3. Assistance in writing subpoenas for computer records.

4. Assistance in auditing computer records.

5. Assistance in interviewing computer personnel (e.g-, computer analysts,

programmers, operators, etc.).

6. Computerized Telephone Number File (CTNF) services which will resequence

telephone numbers to facilitate setting leads and identifying subscribers.

7. Special searches of the NCIC current files or previous records, in addition

to the normal NCIC service.

The DPS is ready to assist the Field in all future major cases. DPS has developed a "Major

Case Information System, " a prototype of which was used in the RESMURS Case.

and for file review prior to trial.

Part I, Section 3 (pages 28 and 29) of the Manual of Rules and Regulations sets forth the way

to request computer support services for investigative matters. I encourage you to take full advantage of

this service.

nated.

In addition, it was determined that a JOHN DOE warrant

Limitations has been toltwin that there was a death penalty

for the crime committed by UNSUB at the time he committed

the crime.

Finally, various avenues of investigative possibilities

Representatives from receiving offices were in

attendance at the Norjak seminar held at San Francisco,

4/8-9/76, where a suggestion was made to institute a pub

licity campaign for

release in early November, 1976, widely

publicizing a reward for any twenty-dollar bill turned in

from the ransom list published in various media periodicals

and possible local newspapers.

This suggestion was approved

at FBIHQ and efforts to initiate appropriate groundwork

steps are now being taken.

Receiving offices should, at this time, contact

major newspapers within their Divisions in an effort to

determine if first they would particpate in this publicity

venture by printing on a one-time, daily, or weekly basis

the list of ransom bill serial numbers and second if

they

agree to printing these, is there a particular form in

which the numbers could be provided to facilitate easier

printing of same.

Newspaper officials should be advised

that calls from individuals concerning the fact that they

possess a twenty-dollar bill of interest will be directed

to the nearest FBI Office.

Enclosed for the Minneapolis Division is one copy

of a list of ransom bills paid in air piracy case dated

11/29/71.

For the information of the Minneapolis Division,

the enclosed lists were disseminated as suggested in referenced

communication approximately five years ago.

To date, none

of the ransom bills have been discovered as a result of this

dissemination.

It is not clear from information contained in

referenced communication as to the insurance company's position

concerning the new ransom proposals.

Timing is critical if

this new program is:to be implemented; therefore, if anything

is going to be done

concerning these proposals, it must be

done soon in order for all preliminaries to be completed prior

to the planned publicity campaign in November of this year.

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient Flight #305 at Portland,

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated

to the stewardess that his brief case contained

a bomb which would blow up the plane unless his

demands were met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

at Seattle, Northwest Orient Airlines complied with

his instructions.

and money, the hijacker allowed all passengers and

the

two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class

section of the aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a southerly

direction and fly at a low altitude and slow speed

which would enable the rear door of the plane to be

opened during the flight.

The hijacker apparently bailed out somewhere

between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada, where

the plane landed to refuel.

It was determined the

hijacker, two parachutes, and the ransom money had

disappeared when the plane was inspected at R8201-81-1968

on 6/4/76, L

for the Yakima

Herald-Rupublic Newspaper, a daily newspaper of wide circulation

in the Yakima area, advised as follows:

With regard to the FBI's request for space to run

a list of ransom bill serial numbers and an accompanying article,

stated that his paper would probably participate in

this if the entire article, including the list of serial numbers, bic

was not extensive and could be set forth in one column of one

page.

stated that should the printing of the serial

numbers take an extensive amount of space to set forth, it

would not be practical for the newspaper to run that type of

article without reimbursement.

concluded by saying

that, should the article be of reasonable size, he would co-

ordinate having the article printed in the Yakima Herald-Republic

on a one-time basis during November, 1976.

For information of Case Agent, there are no other

newspapers or periodicals of significant circulation in the

Yakima area; therefore, no additional contacts were made.

"Malabar VII'

At a waterfiont bar in Papeete, Tahiti, I heard one of the

most bizarre sea stories of our tire.

Would you believe that D. B. Cooper, who bailed out of a

Western Airlines plane five years ago with a fortune in cash,

may be cruising the world's oceans aboard John Alden's

"Malabar VlI" from Dolphin Marina?

"It's our favorite fantasy," vacht biner Dan Streech of

Dana Point said, explaining how "Malabar VIl," which left

Marina dei Rey in 1970, may he insoled in the still-unsolved

mystery of Cooner's successful haist.

del Rey in October, 1970, settling into a berth at Fort

Lauderdale, Florida, after cruising down the Mexican

coastline, through the Panama Canal and exploring the

coastline of Venezuela and Colombia and the islands of the

British West Indies and the Bahamas aboard the 54-foot

woden yawl which had won the 1926 Bermuda Race with

designer Alden at her helm and a schooner rig.

"Malabar VII," one of a dozen and a half boats personally

owned by Alden at launching, was offered for sale by the

Streecises who left her in Fort Lauderdale and returned to the

West Coast, Dan to Dana Point where he began selting boats,

and his dad to the family home in Arizona.

"This man who called himself Mike Selzer decided to buy

our boat," Dan said, "and he'd looked at a lot of boats. He

may have bought ours because we were willing to take his

camper as a trade-in. This was about two months after

Coper Lad made his getaway from the airplane.

"Selzer drove his camper to my folks' home in Arizona, and

they spent a lot of time visiting before he look off for Florida.

My dad sdys Seizer nuntioned he had worked as a smoke

jummjez."

Six wicks after Selzur delivered the camper "nearly new,

witin only 2,000 miles on it," Dan said the F.B.I. turned up at

the Strecch home "and the agents said the man we knew as

Salzer fitted the description of Cooper perfectly. The F.B.I.

ren also stid some of the money Cooper bailed out with had

turned 27 in Las Vegas."

"Mataliar VIJ" with new owner Mike Selzer has never

urned ill awhere, Dan added.

BACK PACKING IN FRENCH POLYNESIA

Dan was oa his way to the Tahiti airport after three wecks

of hiking around the islands of Tahiti, Moorea. Huahine,

Raiatea and Bora Bora with a back pack. He'd gone from one

island to nother as a passenger on the copra boat "Tapera

III, hiking days and siceping nights Cin lie beaches. He said

the land-crabs didn't chew on him (the local rumor that keeps

visitors from camping on the beaches) and very few mosquitos

took a bite: "I was taking Vitamins B 12 and B 6 and 1

understand if you do that, the mosquitos aren't interested

Anyway, I only got one or two bites a day."

Te spent about $i300 in three weeks (plus $750 round-tri

lit fare from Los Angeles) and most of the places where he

camped were near native huts "and the Tahitians brought me

food." He recalled buying "mostly bread, with lots of peanu

butter and jelly."

In his back pack: a sleeping bag, a bedsheet, swim fins and

nask, Stcrno and freeze-dried food, one pair of long pants

The best hotel-bargain has got to be a place in Tahiti near

Jowntown Papeete where you pay 150 franes (S2:14) for a

room. Unless you want a door, then it's 200 francs.

Across from the cruising boats on Papeete's waterfront i

he Stewart Hotel (about S10), a favorite among cruisin

people who want to get off their boats. At the opposite end al

the spectrum are the big glassy high-rise hotels where you pay

$S0 und more to meet other tourists.

I stumbled into a happy compromise: the aging Te Puna Be

Air, a hotel four miles outside Papeete frequented by

Americans and Europeans who visit Tahiti often. Quiet,

charming and inexpensive by Tahiti standards (about

$20-522), it's sandwiched between tvo American-style luxury

hotels and you can hike over to their white-sand beaches.

One of tite charms of the Te Puna Bel Air is its

inconsistencius: I met four women from Sacramento who were

staying there and they had no hot water (l did), I had a wasp

nest on iny balcony (they didn't), they had ice in a refrigerator

(I didn't) but I had a bottle of Scotch (they didn't). We pooled

our resources and scon felt we had a luxury suite.

Also, we mer istard people who treat the hotel bar and

restaticart as a local hangout. Two of us explored a nearby

reut with Amien scuba divers who live in'Tahiti, and white

man or atleled or the surfice, they woui down isu reet and

brougnt up black coral.

They called

i coral whips, and it looked like wire

coa hangers someone had straightened out. They said it sells

for nbout $300 a pound locally.

ISLAND HOPPING BY BOAT

• Inter island freighters ofter expeditions for visitors: one is a

40-day trip with stops at 116 islands and. atofis. and it costs

about $300. For the visitor on a brief vacation, John Stegenga

of the schooner "Candide," four years out of Marina del Rey,

suggested this one wlsich he took:

"The 'Timi Hani,' a 150 foot diesel freighter, leaves

P'apcete every Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. You sleep on deck with

oter travelers, including many Tahitians who sing and dance

at night, and there are always people playing guitars.

"The freighter puts in a Huahini, Raiatea, T'ahaa and Bora

Bora and you go ashore and buy food at the Chinese grocery

stores that are always close to the docks. You cook on deck.

"The 'Timi Hani' brings you back to Papeete on Sunday or

Monday and you huve spent about 700 francs ($10) plus

groceries for a weck-long tour of some of the most beautiful

islands in the South Pacific."

offer a reward for any of the bait money turned in in con-

nection with this matter.

to cooperate in the plan should it materialize and he raised

the question of how many bait bill numbers would have to be

published. He explained it would be very tedious, cumber-

some and expensive to print and publish the list of bait

bills if it was an extensive list. He explained that the

paper has an offset printing

press and that if the FBI

could furnish an offset proof publishing the list of serial

numbers would be simple

and involve little or no expense to

the newspaper.

He reiterated that his paper would be happy to

cooperate in the plan if and when it materializes.

RECOMMENDATION

to facilitate publication of the bait bills.

It is noted that the 'Bremerton Sun" is the leading

newspaper on the Olympic Peninsula and covers all of Kitsap

ReBuairtel, 5/5/76.

Inquiry with the two major newspapers in San

Francisco, revealed they had no interest in publishing the

serial numbers of the $20 bills used in captioned case.

This conclusion was made even after this office attempted

to point out how such publication of the bills could

increase their circulation. After one of the newspapers had

• said

it had no interest in publishing the serial numbers, this infor-.

mation was passed on to the other paper to consider

the exclusive:

ness it would have in publishing the

serial numbers. This

approach also proved unproductive.

Contacts with other newspapers in this Division were -

also net with negativa results.
