The Robin Hood syndrome -

• Once upon a time there was an English

archer named Robin Hood who lived

in Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire.

He gathered unto himself a band of

rebels who supported themselves by

robbing the rich upperclass gentry that

ventured into his domain.

Over the years, Mr. Hood has been

immortalized in song and poem for his

legendary deeds. Many proverbs and

sayings have been handed down in Eng-

lish literature that give this group of

rogues an undeserved aura of respecta-

bility.

Legends die hard. Mr. Hood and his

gangsters still occupy an honored place

in story books, cartoons and films al-

though their greedy motivations have

been sanitized for young minds.

While Air Line Pilot is not in the busi-

ness of destroying legends, one fact is

clear. Mr. Hood was a thief, pure and

simple, even though those he relieved

of their gold might have been able to

afford the loss.

A modern-day Robin Hood has now

emerged. He told Northwest Airlines

his name was D. B. Cooper when he

boarded Flight 305 during the Thanks-

giving holidays. After takeoff, he com-

mandeered the 727, threatened to blow

it up, demanded and got $200,000 and

four parachutes and then bailed out

somewhere between Portland, Ore.,

and Reno, Nev.

When it turned out that Mr. Cooper ;

couldn't be promptly located, his name i

and dramatic deed caught the public

fancy. There were some citizens who

felt he had earned the $200,000 through

his act of bravery and daring. A song

was written about him; a Portland ven-

dor is reportedly doing well selling T-

It is certainly recognized that a

person experiencing an inadvertent

parachute opening while secured by

a safety belt would

suffer serious

g or possibly fatal injury. On the

i

other hand, we have evidence to

2

show that

accidents have been

3

caused by jump occupants who

4

were not wearing their safety belts.

The

Southern

5

Region récently

6

investigated two such accidents.

The pilot in each case was unable

to maintain control of the jump

& aircraft because the parachutists on

9 board were not wearing their safety

o belts.

What should

have been

! nothing more than two minor in-

2

through

noncompliance

with

Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR)

7:91.14.

It is our feeling that safety

7 would suffer far more by allowing

& parachutists to ignore this rule than

, would be the case of requiring them

to have their safety belts fastened

during takeoff and landing. The

• chances of a pilot having to abort

2

atakeoff run or make an emergency

? stop during landing will, I think,

4 be greater

than inadvertent para-

5 chute openings during takeoff and

5 landing.

3

FAR 91.14 applies only during

takeoff and landing. The rule does

9

not

prohibit unfastening safety

O belts after a takeoff has been com-

- pleted; however, I would sincerely

Zhope that jump aircraft pilots

3 would request that safety belts be

# kept fastened until an altitude has

§been attained which would at least

give the victim of an inadvertent

The Executive Borrd of the Assoc-

(Lec. 7-10; in Washington to register

"total opposition"-to FAR's proposal

te impose responsibility for medical

certification and surveiliance of flight

crew members upon the individual air

cci iers.

The Board directed the Aero-

ni tee "to take any and all steps it

adoption" of the proposal and instruct-

=c ve Asiociation's President to "pro-

viue the necesary support and resour-

ces," and including "if recessary" re-

c= ening the Executive Board for

consideratio: "of othe: appropriate

cúr ses of action."

The Board, after lengthy discussion

concerning the impact of the Aloha

¿"' ration award on ALPA's crew com-

plement policy, reaff med its "full

and vigorous support oi the crew com-

f. nent policy and of all existing

agreements and owards establishing the

same." The Board said that consistent

with the Nov. 23 arbitration award

(which it noted "applied and interpret-

ed the Association's policy as being

founded on safety as related to the

operating conditions and enviroment of

the carrier involved'") and consistent

with past practice, the Boeing 737

crew complement policy is interpreted

to require "with the concurrence of

the Executive Committee and the Pre-

sident" that the MEC on each airline

involved assess that airline's conditions-

and enviromental factors "and' reach a

determination as to the basis of imple-

mentation" of the crew complement

policy.

The Board ordered the Presi-

dent to "cause the Association to pro-

vide full support to such determina-

tions" and to conclude agreements

that give full effect to such determi-

nations.

Finally, the Board said the Pre-

sident and the Execut:ve Committee

should study and eva: ate "crew co-

ordination and operating techniques

on all airline jet aircraft."

Other actions taken by the Exe-

cutive Board include the following:

Supported the Ai.worthiress and

over the use of reduced-thrust tokeoff

procedures.

•'ROBIN

HOOD'

Despite some attempts to prove

otherwis: through opportunism and

commercialism, the person who labels

himself as "D. B. Cooper" is--if he is

still alive --no modern-day Robin Hiood.

He is a thief and a criminal of the

highest order. He demonstrated more

than passing knowledge of the air en-

vironment, especially parachuting.. it

is possible that "D. B. Cooper's" path

may have crossed that of airline per-

sonnel--and airline pilots--at some

time under another name. He is re-

ported to have a bitter hatred against

the airlines--he may have worked for

one.

For these reasons PILOT BULLETIN

is printing the specifications of the

criminal that extorted $200,000 from

Northwest Airlines on Nov. 24, 1971.

Two artist drawings of "Cooper" are

included in the hopes they may prod

the memories of ALPA members who

may have seen or known him in the

past.

tion describes the man as follows:

ALPA PRESSES FOR ACTION ON

MID-AIR COLLISIONS

•

Pointing to a "needless slaughter"

resulting from 70 mid-air collisions of

U.S. airliners in the past 25 years,

ALPA urged congressional action io

make collision-avoidance equipment a

mandatory requirement for all aircrot

operating in government-controlled

airspace.

In testimony before the Senate

Subcommittee on Aviation on Dec. 1,

the Association emphasized the in-

creasing hazards of mid-air accidents.

A study made by the Department of

Transportation, ALPA said, projected

that by 1980 there would be approx-

imotely 10 mid-air collisions occur-

ring each year. In 1971, there were

four such tragedies.

ALPA recommended two govem-

ment adtions that should be taken im-

mediately to reduce or eliminate the

mid-air collision hazard:

"The first of these requires an im-

mediate decision on the part of the U.

S. goverrment that the use of an ade-

quate collision avoidance system or

proximity worning indicator should be

made mondatory for every aircraft de

operated within controlled airspace.

"The other action requires that

the Federal Aviation Administration

take a more realistic and sophisticated

approach to inflight segregation of

military and general aviation aircraft

from airline and other high performance

civil oircraft."

In addition to these recommendo-

tions, ALPA asked for a live evaluo-

tion of the several collision avoidance

systems now available. Recognizing

that installation of these systems would

entail particular burdens for light

plane owner, ALPA called for devel-

opment of a plan to help them finance

this hardware.

Although ALPA does not endorse

any particular equipment now being

offered as solutions to the collision

problem, it supported the Sénate bill

under consideration (S. 2264), which

would facilitate the installation of

collision avoidance devices.

"The

establishment of definite compliance

dates, " ALPA said,

"will also empha-

size the urgency of the problem: and

ake it out of the 'stüdy categ
