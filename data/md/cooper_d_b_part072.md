In the presence of the reporting Agent,

these men examined said parachute, and announced that prior

to its having been released from its container by someone

pulling the rip cord, it was in operational condition and

could have been utilized for a parachute jump.

They advised

the canvas pack it was originally packed in. They also noted

that while the nylon chute itself was in good condition, two

of the 24 nylon lines attaching same to the canvas pack had

been cut and removed. They advised that this type of parachute

was generally used by sky jumpers inasmuch as the pilot chute

had been removed and removal was noted on the inspection card

contained in a pocket of the canvas pack.

This card identified

the parachute as a 24 foot Ripatock type; DA-58-53912 as the

serial number; manufactured in October 1959; owned by the

Dots of transcriplion November 30, 1971

S. LEWIS WALLICK, & Test Pilot employed by The

Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington, telephone 655-4031,

furnished the following

information:

He was the Chief Test Pilot on the Boeing 727

project and he conducted the flight testing of this aircraft.

On several occasions during this testing he

intentionally lowered the rear stairs under the tail of the

aircraft while in flight

• The effect of lowering these stairs

in flight was hardly noticeable on the controls and the only

positive indication he had that the stairs were lowered was

the lighting of an indicator light on the instrument panel.

The stairs were lowered at a speed of 150 knots.

While the

stairs were lowered the plane remained in the same attitude.

There was no yawing or pitching.

He furnished the following opinions in connection

with the question of whether or not a pilot would feel in his

controls a sudden loss of weight of approximately 180 pounds

from the tail of a 727. He advised that if the pilot were

flying the aircraft manually and if the air were calm, he would

feel a sudden loss of 180 pounds weight from the tail

aircraft.

He explained that the loss of this weight would move

the center of gravity toward the front of the airplane and while

this movement would be slight, it could be felt in the wheel by

the pilot.

He stated, however, that if the air were turbulent,

it is doubtful that the pilot would feel this sudden loss of

weight. He indicated also that if the plane were being flown

on auto-pilot the loss of this weight would not be felt by the

pilot.

He advised that if the rear stairs on a 727 is

lowered in flight at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet a

change in pressurization occurs and this could be felt by the

crew if the door leading into the cockpit is open. If the

cockpit door were closed, it is doubtful that the

crew would

experience the change in pressurization.

On November 27, 1971L

a man who is

faniliar with parachute clubs and jumpers in the southwestern

part of Washington and northern part of Oregon, advised that

a person jumping from a plane at about 7000 feet who had

experience could free fail and while doing so could count

to 25 seconds which would then place him at 3000 feet and

for this reason no altimeter would be needed. He pointed

out that if the subject could have seen the ground there would

be no problem in landing if he had experience as a jumper.

He further pointed out that his experience as a jumper

shows him that the subject would not have needed jump boots,

a helmet, jump suit, or any other special equipment for

he and other chutists jump in shorts, tennis shoes, and

other non-jumping equipment when weather conditions are

right. He also pointed out that the subject could land

within one mile of a pin point spot picked if he had

experience and knew when to jump.

Further, he stated the

subject would have travelled 1/2 to 3/4 of

a mile from the

drop line from the plane in a 30 mile per hour wind if he

opened his chute at 3000 feet.

lalso advised that

he could also state that if the subject had experience

he would know that the easiest place to put a container with

the money would be between his legs and this would not

cause any problems on landing or during descent. L

S, LEWIS WALLICK, a Test Pilot employed by The

He was the Chief Test pilot on the Boeing 727

project and he conducted the flight testing of this aircraft.

The effect of lowering these stairs

in flight was hardly noticeable on the controls and the only

positive indication he had that the stairs were lowered was

the lighting of an indicator light on the instrument panel.

The stairs were lowered at a speed of 150 knots.

While the

stairs were lowered the plane remained in the same attitude.

There was no yawing or pitching.

He furnished the following opinions in connection

with the question of whether or not a pilot would feel in his

controls a sudden loss of weight of approximately 180 pounds

from the tail of a 727. He advised that if the pilot were

flying the aircraft manually and if the air were calm, he would

feel a sudden loss of 180 pounds weight from the tail of the

aircraft.

He explained that the loss of this weight would move

the center of gravity toward the front of the airplane and while

this movement would be slight, it could be felt in the wheel by

the pilot.

He stated, however, that if the air were turbulent,

it is doubtful that the pilot would feel this sudden loss of

weight. He indicated also that if the plane were being flown

COSSEY advised that all chutes are identified to the

particular chute by a serial number placed thereon by the manu-

facturer.

In addition, a parachute must be repacked perio-

dically and the missing parachute was repacked by COSSEY and

the date as well as other identifying data placed on a card

which is then inserted in a pocket on the container.

COSSEY advised that his records do contain the serial

numbers of the various parachutes that he has made and/or in-

spected and that he would check his record for the serial num-

ber of the missing parachute.

COSSEy advised that the missing parachute is made

up of a surplus Navy harness and container and that he very

definitely would be able to identify the chute.

The missing chext chute was described as

Follows:

Main Chute

This is actually the only chute in the chest

pack as there is no pilot chute.

This chute is white

nylon with white shroud lines and was actually made up

by COSSEY from a parachute which had been scrapped. COSSEY

said he doubts if the serial number is still on the chute

because he cut the parachute in half and then sewed it

together. He did this in order to make the chute small

enough to fit into the container. COSSEY explained that

the chute was placed in a container and was used for

training purposes of students learning to parachute and

was not intended ever to be used as a real parachute.

He said the trainee was suspended approximately

three feet from the ground during part of his training

process and simulated operating the back pack as well as

the chest chute.

COSSEY advised that he very definitely would be

able to identify the chest pack whether or not there is a

serial number on it. However, if there is a serial number

on it, COSSEY said he would have made no record of it because

it was a scrapped chute.

COSSEY also explained that an experienced jumper

who inspected the dummied up chest chute probably would

be aware that it was not operable.

ALVIN CURIIS HARTLEY appeared at the Glenwood Springs

Resident Agency on the morning of July 11, 1973, and was

immediately furnished a "Waiver of Rights"

form which he read,

advised he understood but refused to sign.

HARTLEY again emphasized that he had nothing to do

with the hijacking of Northeast Airlines Flight #305, again

stating that at that time he had suffered a broken left wrist

and at this particular time was in a cast. It was pointed

out to HARTLEY that investigation withl

Las Vegas, Nevada, reflected that he had

had indicated he had changed the cast only on two occasions

while HARTLEY had previously mentioned that he had changed

the cast approximately four to five times. HARTLEY advised

he did not care what the records at the doctor's office showed

and that he had only gone to the one doctor and that he did have

at least four separate casts replaced on his broken arm. He

advised he kept the cast on through January and February of 1972.

HARTLEY advised that he had had back surgery the summer

of 1960 by

the Southern Nevada Hospital, Las Vegas, Nevada.

He stated he

is currently able to do fairly strenuous exercise but he

personally would not feel capable of jumping from an aircraft

and would feel he would seriously damage his back.

It was pointed out to HARILEY that the simplest procedure

for eliminating him as

a suspect in this

case was for him to

furnish elimination major case prints which he agreed to do.

HARTLEY was taken to the Ginwood Springs Police Department where

he was major case printed.

being sought on some

She realizes D. B. COOPER had a knowledge of

navigation and of parachuting and ROBERT is highly skilled

at both. She believed he received his commercial flying

Of JACK BRYANT COFFELT (now deceased), advised that photos

of BRYANT COFFELT as obtained by SA C. ROBERT STRANGER

of the Los Angeles Division of the FBI were similar in

appearance, but she did not think the individuals in the

photographs were identical to JACK COFFELT. She advised

that JACK COFFELT always wore horn-rimmed glasses as

compared to the regular frame glasses as displayed in

the one photograph; and in addition, JACK COFFELT did not

display the smoking mannerism of having his cigarette

dangling from his lips at center mouth as depicted in the

other photograph.

She further advised she still has one photo of

JACK COFFELT somewhere which she has displayed to the FBI

in Honolulu in the past, and she will make it available

again for comparative purposes.

She stated, however, she

will not allow the photograph to be reproduced.

A comparison of this

with that of the Bureau artist, Photograph of JACK COFFELT

two individuals are not identical.
