At 2:35 PM, today SRA THOMAS J. MANNING, Longview

RA, telephonically contacted the writer and furnished the

following information:

At approximately 2:20

Pil today SA MANNING received

an anonymous call at the Longview RA from an individual who

according to MANNING, spoke as an intelligent individual.

This person asked MANNING what the reward in the "D.B. COOPER"

case amounted to. MANNING related what the reward in this

case is, whereupon the caller stated, "That's not enough"

and hung up.

At approximately 2:23 PM, the same individual re-

contacted MANNING at the RA and stated that he has observed

the lower portion of a human body hanging from a parachute

stating that he can see this through binoculars from his

residence. SA MANNING encouraged the caller to give him

more information but the caller refused to say anything

more except that he would be into the Longview ri in about

an hour and a half with some physical evidence in the captioned

case.

I asked MANNING if he had any idea who the caller

might be and MANNING said his voice sounds familiar.

Further

that the caller stated he knows MANNING by sight and in fact

has been interviewed by MANNING in the RA.

SA MANNING was relating the above information to

me in the event this materializes and it is necessary to

saturate the area with Agent personnel for a search of the

Several times I have seen the "D.B. Cooper" segment on "In

Search Of", on TV. Each time I notice that the artist's sketch

of "D.B. Cooper" strongly resembles

a man I knew in 1955. He

was one of the USAF aviation cadets at Hondo Air Base, Texas.X

He displayed some unusual characteristics for a pilot candidate.

He was disorganized

and preoccupied. Though the academic schedule

was posted well in advance, he would study the wrong subjects,

and was a marginal student. In the flight phase of his training,

he soloed the PA-18 Cub without serious problems, but barely

made it in the more advanced T-6.

On the occasion of his first night cross-country flight, he

made all the required radio calls (engine start, taxi, takeoff.

and departure overhead on course). But he made no in-flight

position reports until he called for permission to enter the

traffic pattern. On questioning, he admitted he had not taken

off;- he had made the radio calls from his airplane while parked

on the ground at a remote part of the airfield.

soon afterward, his background check revealed that hel

had this information

been revealed in his statement of personal history.

as an enlisted man.

In 1971, he was approximately years old, - assuming he did

not falsify his age in 1954, when he entered the pre-flight

phase of Aviation Cadet training.

I have never mentioned this before, even though I have seen that

program several times. First, the similarity in appearance is

not too convincing, since it was an artist's drawing, not a

photograph, second, I didn't (and still don't) want to embarrass

him or cause any problems for him. Third, I always hoped that

"D.B. Cooper" would be identified. Fourth, if I had to bet on

it, I would bet it is not the same man, because the appear

ance of the artist's drawing is that of a quite common type of

face.

If you decide to bother with this, his name is

He has obtained fingerprints of this

with latent fingerprints which were located in the aircraft

following captioned hijacking. It should be noted that there

were some latent fingerprints as well as palm prints located in

the aircraft.

It has been explained to L

will be made and he will be advised of the results. He states,

however, that on advice of his attorney, he does not desire to

make these fingerprints available until

agreement with him that they will not prevent him from publishing

his book.

It has been explained that the FBI will in no way inter

marketing his book. Ile has stated, however, that because of his

HOW HE FOILED TBI

SUBJ

21-81-8318

Last November24th, a man Identifying himself as

" Cooper" parachuted from a Northwest Orient

itnes.727 jetliner between Seattle and Reno Nevada

with a parcel containing 10,000 twenty dollar bills which

was the ransom money that had been delivered to him

while he held the planes crew hostage at the Seattle-

Tacoma international airport.

The F.B.L, and other state and local law enforcement

agents assisted by compantes of G.L's from Fort Lewis

have futilly wasted many hours and thousands of tax-

payers dollars looking for cooper.

So lar Cooper has successfully eluded his following

in the same ingenious manner that he pulled off his

skyjack caper, cooly staying a safe distance away from

danger.

The F.B.I headquaters" in Seattle has vowed to scri

utinize every foot of land between the Sea-Tac airport

and Reno to turn up clues in the case.

Despite rewards of 5,000 dollars-by the Medias "

Fink on your Friends" programe the public has generally

wanted Cooper adoration and somewhat a hero status.

anonymous interviewer from the twice weekly

nunspaper the 'Seattle Flag' has produced a story from

a taped interview with D.B, Cooper which is validated

by the presentation of one of the recorded twenty dollar

bills included in the ransom money.'

This story was run in the 'Flag' because the inter-

viewer was unable to send it to the 'Post-Intellingener'

because they had the 5,000 dollar reward out for Coopers

head also television stations would have requested a lape

from which voice prints could possible be produced.

Therefore; running the story in the Flag was the only

solution,

Cooper said that the witnesses description were off

by about fifteen pounds and a couple of inches, Also that

the artist's impression were very poor. When asked why

He wis sull in Washington state he added that he felt

'It tias safer to hide where no one would imagine him to

be rather then to go to some place like Mexico or South

tomer ta where the autoritles would naturalivexpecthim

to ga

He said he started achul work on his skyjackdug plan:

last

June. The lina 1 of come to him white he was

it was a calculated risk that's why he jumped in bad

weather and at night, also he waited a little longer than

usual before pulling his ripcord.

Adding that his tree

fall was about 5,000 ol the total 7,000 feet. Which was very

risky doing at night.

He came down about a hundred miles away from S.W..

Washington contrary to the F.B.I, report that he touched

dorm near Vancouver Washington.

The first thing he did on landing was bury his chute,:

; he was within five miles of where he had intended in an

evergreen wooded terrain. He credited this.accuracy

to his projected calculations and his japanese watch.

He wouldn't say whether he had an accomplice on the.

four different layers. These layers consisted of an upper sand

layer, a post dredging sand layer, a clay lump (dredge) sand

layer,

and below that an older sand layer. The upper layer con-

sisted of six inches to eight inches of reworked beach sand

and is the sand which contained the fragments and bundles of

the recovered money. This sand also contained soda pop cans and

other debris, which were not severely damaged or rusted. The

post dredging sand contained older soda pop cans, rusted nails

and spikes, and other rusted artifacts, which were in a much more

deteriorated condition.

The clay lump

• (dredge) sand was a mix-

ture of course sand and fragments of organic clay material,

ranging from one inch to five inches in size. Based on U.S. Corps

of Engineering records which reflect that they dredged the Columbia

River at this

older sands, which were light in color and uniform in texture

He also made available the envelope containing

He stated that he received this letter several

he based this assumption on the fact that the writer

stated the skyjacking occurred in 1969, which is erroneous.

RE: D.D. Cooper

I had the pleasure, or should I say the opportunity of talking to D.D. Cooper

in Portland Oregon, in a night club, right after his celebrated Hijacking, in which

he parachuted out of an airplane, and into history.

actually a chance meeting, but he was talking to me in a low voice acout

how he didint need the money, only the prestigue of knowing that the E.B.I. could

be had, he stated to me that

the F.B.I. only respect a sharp. and wise criminal,

and that the sharper you are the lass crine that you do.

D.D. Cooper mentioned to me that the latest pictures of him in the paper were not

accwate, and that he was going to have Plastic Surgery, his words were Cosnetic Surgery.

D.D. Cooper was the coolest man that I had ever met, he seemed so professional;

• a big heist in las Vegas, and lived to tell acout it; I replied; D.D. That's lafia

money you're talking about, and he said yeah, I know, that's what keeeps me

notivated.

I'Ii say one thing for D.D. he loves Tatoos, he has them all over his arms, and legs.

He claims that he paid a fortune to have them did when he was in the army.

I could go on talking akout D.D. Cooper all day, but I must close now;

For D.D. Along with Former President Richard M. Nixon are like so many other

self-tortured souls no are vengeful of the E.B.I, for turning them down, when

they so desperately wanted to be a member of the F.B.I.

I thank you.

ARMED AND DANGEROUS

Synopsis:

To set lead for Special Projects Section to conduct

aging of original composites of

subject Cooper.

Enclosures: Enclosed for the Special Project Section are two

color copies of a composite sketch prepared by the Exhibits

Section, Administrative Division, dated 1/2/1973, one depicting

subject

in dark glasses.

Also enclosed is a synopsis of

captioned event to include subject's physical description and age

as of the date of the hijacking, 11/24/1971.

Details:

Above-referenced telcalls with SSA

Special Projects, has indicated that aging of

these photographs

should be possible.

A review of the case subfile concerning this

sketch has determined that the original

Sketches were maintained

by the Exhibits Sections under Bureau file number 164-2111.

These sketches, although not the first prepared by the Exhibits

Section for this case, were determined to be the best likeness of

subject Cooper.

DOJ and the Seattle U.S. Attorney's Office have

recently reaffirmed that the statute of limitations in this crime

is infinite due to hijacking being a capital offense in 1971.

Captioned matter remains the only unresolved hijacking in U.s.

history.

It is anticipated that the original sketch and aged

sketch will receive nationwide media attention as several

networks, including ABC and the Discovery Channel are apparently

planning to once again run presentations on this case.

ReBuairtel 1/2/78 to Seattle, Denver, and Minneapolis.

The color ssetch prepared of Unsuo in captioned case,

wilch is marked "I" and dated 1/3/79, is considered by shibite

Section at this date to be the best Ilkeness obtainable from descriptive

data avallable. The original artist's sketet, with and without sunglasces

and designated as "'A" sketch, was a blach and white rendering of Unsub

prepared iramediately following hijacking. Subsequently the color sketch,

with and without sunglasses, was developed and narked as "g" sketch.

Although a divergence of opinion regarding certain characteristics has

appeared in descriptions given by the varfous witnesses, the consensus

indicates that a good likeness of Unsun is shown by the artist's ketch

and that the "3"' sketch with the added dimension of color more accurately

shows the Unsub's age and overall likeness.

In view of the numerous contacts with the witnesses who

sappiled the descriptive data from which the sketch was prepared and

the lapse of time since they observed the hijaciser, it is felt no consirue-

tive purpose cas be served by further attempts at modificatton based on

contect with these same witnesses.

Enclosed for each agent receiving this memo

THE CRIME

A lone white male boarded Northwest Orient

Airlines Flight Number 305 at Portland, Oregon, on

November

24, 1971.

At approximately 3:22 p.m., while

the flight was en route to Seattle, Washington, he

indicated to a stewardess that his briefcase contained a

bomb which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

met.

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes

in exchange for the safety

of the 36 passengers

aboard the plane.

When the aircraft landed at Seatite,

Northwest Orient Airlines complied with his instructions.

After he received the parachutes and money, the hijacker

allowed all passengers and two of the airline stewardesses

to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members into

the first-class section of the aircraft and informed them

he desired to fly to Mexico City. The hijacker instructed

that the plane proceed in a southerly direction and fly at

a low altitude and slow speed which enabled the rear door

of the plane to be opened during the flight.

December.

He noted that the photograph appeared to be a

different one from that which has been circulated before and

wanted to know if he could run this as a story.

I told him I would contact him later about it.

I called SA L

Jat the Bureau and

advised him that the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin carried

an article on this case and that the photograph appeared to

be that one which we are currently trying to update, but so

far as I knew a final version of it had not been prepared at

the Bureau.

He advised that this was true and he didn't know why

the photograph was published.

I contacted I

were not making any additional comment on this, other than

that which appeared in the law enforcement bulletin.

In accordance with the request of the Seattle

Office 8/7/72, a color artist's conception was prepared

and forwarded

to the Seattle Office.

To date the Bureau

has received no evaluation of this color sketch. Seattle's

request for mats will not be further considered

until the

Bureau receives an evaluation by the witnesses of the

color sketch.

For the information of the Seattle Office,

commercial engravers charge $10 per 50 minutes plus

initial charge of $8 for a 4" x 5" plate. These mats will

only reproduce in black and white. Many publishers both

large and small presently use the offset printing process

which does not require a mat.

The Seattle Office should promptly coordinate

review of the Bureau's color sketch for the purpose of

evaluation. If it is deemed advisable that the mats

be prepared, resubmit your recommendation.

she could suggest nothing additional to make sketch a better likeness.

additional photos as resembling varlous features of Unsub. This plus the

comments and look-alike photos selected by stewardessesI

went into the preparation of composite drawing with sunglasses.

The sketch was modified to show the eyes when additional witnesses later

selected look-alike photos of the eyes.

The attempt to depict the apparent age of Unsub has proven

difficult from the beginning since witnesses did not describe age lines or

features that lend themselves to the aging process. Preparation of the

drawing in color may contribute to the aging factor as well as show the

complexion color. In view of

more recent comments, an

additional sketch in color and labeled "B" has been prepared by Exhibits

SUBJECT: NORJAK

RE: ARTIST'S CONCEPTION

Enclosed is a copy of photo KK5-1 in the Facial

Lines Section of the Facial Identification Catalogue, and

copy of the

artist's composite of UNSUB.

The following information is being submitted for

Bureau review, and the enclosed leads are being set forth

on an UACB basis:

Or. 12/2/71, a key witness,

insisted that the artist's conception was not a good likeness

of the hijacker.

She requested permission to examine the

Facial Identification Catalogue and innediately picked out

photograph KK5-1 in the Facial Lines

Section stating, "that

is him, except for the ears and hair."

She explained that the

person

depicted in that particular photograph resembled

the man; however, the ears of the hijacker did not protrude

as far from the head and she felt that the hair line should

be somewhat lower than that on the man depicted on photo

кK5-1.

She was very adamant in her insistence that the

artist's conception shown to her was not a good likeness

of the hijacker.

A comparison of the artist's composite of UNSUB

and photo KK5~1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man much

younger than the man depicted in photo KR5-1.

The man in

KK5-I appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite shows

the man in his late 20s or early 30s.

RE: ARTIST'S CONCEPTION

Such X

Enclosed is a copy of photo KK5-1 in the Facial

Lines Section of the Facial Identification Catalogue, and

a copy of the artist's composite of UNSUB.

The Bureau advised by teletype dated 12/17/71

as follows:

"It is expected the Seattle Office will continue

to give this matter close supervisory attention and insure

investigation is conducted promptly and thoroughly."

In view of this, the enclosed information is being

submitted in memorandum form, first for supervisor evaluation

and approval prior to being forwarded to the Bureau for

approval.

A key witness, C

was very

adamant in her insistence that the artist's

conception was

not a good likeness of the hijacker. In an FD-302 dated

12/2/71,

Istated that the coneption was not, in

her opinion, a good likeness of the hijacker.

She requested

permission to examine the Facial Identification Catalogue

and immediately picked out photo tKK5-1 in the Facial Lines

Section stating,

"that is him, except for the ears and hair."

She explained that the person depicted in that particular

photo closely resembled the man; however, the ears of the

hijacker did not protrude as far from the head and she felt

that the hair line should be somewhat lower than that on the

man depicted on photo KK5-1. She was very adamant in her

insistence that the artist's conception shown to her wag not

a good likeness of the hijacker.

164-81-344

744

A comparison of the artist's composite of UNSUß

and photo KK5-1 revealed the primary difference between the

two photos is UNSUB's composite appears to be a man much

younger than theman depicted in photo KK5-1. The man in

KK5-1 appears to be in his mid-40s while the composite shows

the man in his late 20s or early 30s.

He was advised that the pertinent

But the coalition government, intent on

land, and lower taxes, almost regained the

presidency via the ballot box. The govern-

law and a curfer-to prevent urban violence

QUITE SO MUCH. AS HE REMEMBERS IT, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE CURLY AND DE-

FINITELY SHORT. HE ALSO THINKS THE NOSE AND FACE SLIGHTLY TOO THIN,

ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH. FEELS ARTISI'S SKETCH MAKES HIM LOOK YOUNGER

WITNESS

SAID THE CHIN AND CHEEKBONE OF

COMPOSITE PHOTO ARE SIMILAR TO KH ONE DASH EIGHT AND FACIAL LINES •

SIMILAR TO KK SIX DASH THREE. THE NECK AND CHIN OF UNSUB APPEAR AS

IF HE HAD BEEN FAT AND LOST WEIGHI, LEAVING SOME FLABBY SKIN. EVERY-

THING FROM NOSE UP IS GOOD: MOUTH IS ALSO GOOD. OVERALL PIC-

TURE OF COMPOSITE MAKES UNSUB APPEAR YOUNGER THAN HE ACTUALLY IS.

was wearing dark glasses when L

saw him and he was

unable to furnish any particulars about

the hijacker's eyes.

J (contacted 11/29/71),

Seattle, was displayed an artist's conception of the

hijacker.

After studying the artist's sketch,

made the following comments.

He stated that the hijacker had an over-all

appearance which was in some ways similar to the artist's

sketch; however, he recalled that the hijacker had a broader

nose, wider forehead and face in general, than that depicted

in the sketch. He also noted that the hijacker's hairline

was somewhat lower than the sketch and the hijacker's glasses

had squarer corners than the round corners or cornered glasses

depicted in the sketch.
