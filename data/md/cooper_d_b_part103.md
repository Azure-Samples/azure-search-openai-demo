I have been struck by the resemolance between D. B. Cooper

the highjacker and John E. List of Westfield, New Jersey accused

of murdering his family.

I believe they are the same man.

The age seems right.

The contour of the head and hairline

seems right.

There is a pattern in the cleverness and coolness of the

way he carefully planned both crimes:

In reference to the recent hijacking committed by

(D. Cooper) I've been reading various news articles and I believe

I've discovered something of value. Consider the enclosed news-

paper clippings. There is a definite resemblance between the

photo of John E. List and the artist conception of D. Cooper.

It would seem that Mr. List has the type of grooming,

background and intelligence that has been desdribed by witnesses

in the hijacking incident. Also, Mr. 'List would have the motive

because if he were killed during the hijacking, he would have

nothing to lose since he had already murdered his family. It

"is suspected in both cases that each man has left the country.

He is an ex paratrooper with 99 jumps to his credit.

He has used both type parachutes, with static line and

free fall type. He has flown many times in all types of

planes.

Including jets and is very familar with pro-

I cegdures.

He is 43 yrs. old, 5'12" tall dark brown hair

usually worn short. Brown eyes, pronilment nose and has

a very nervous twitch in his chin when under pressure.

He carries a brown brief case when traveling:

RE: WILLIAM LATHAM

Mr. EMERY W. CHAPPLE, JR., Commissioner of Public

Safety, State of Alaska, Juneau, Alaska, advised that he had

received information from a source that WILLIAM LATHAM, who

reportedly resides in Tigard, Oregon, resembles the artist's

conception of the Unknown Subject in this case.

Mr. CHAPPLE

said that according to his source, LATHAM passed through

Juneau, Alaska during the summer of Lord and while there

of the

Breakwater Hotel, who in turn contacted Mr. CHAPPLE's source,

Who toOK LAThAM on a fishing trip.

LATHAM was described as

approximately 42 years of age, tall, slender,

gentlemanly,

a smooth talker with a nice voice who claimed to have been

a singer at one time. It was also believed that LATHAM

possibly sells mobile homes in the Tigard area and possibly

lobbied in the Oregon Legislature.

Mr. CHAPPLE said that his source has no further

information whatsoever regarding LATHAM but did make

available a photograph of him which was taken on this fishing

trip.

Washington.

Both witnesse advised

that there is no

similar physical resemblance between

subject of NORJAK hijacking.

Fort Lawton, Haahington,

advised on January 10,, 1972,

that when

Seattle, Washington, he

had in his possession two traveler's checks for $20 each,

and made no statement to the effect that he had $600 in '

traveler's checks in his room in Seattle, Hashington.

said he did'

not know where the story that

had $600 in $20 travelèr's

checks had originated, but-

stated that he knew nothing of such actually being correct.

In view of the fact that

has been eliminated

by two witnesses in Seattle, as being a suspect in NORJAK

hijacking, and that there is no other evidence to indicate

that

was connected with the NORJAK hijacking, it is

recomnended

that this sub file be closed as a NORJAK suspect.

letters which were sent to the WASHINGTON POST and several

The lab report says that this is the same style

of type and certain limited characteristics suggest the

that they may have been prepared on the same

For this reason they want us to check him

out today,

if possible, and advise the Bureau by telephone
