Dear FBI:

I've been receiving phone calls from

someone

"D.B. Cooper," the

1971 air hijacker.

Chances

are it's a hoax, but as a journalist I can't drop it without looking

into it.

Is this 11-year-old case still open with you? If so, I'll be

happy to tell you what I've got if you want to hear it.

Maybe you

can help me decide whether to write up my notes or throw them in the

wastebasket.

Cooper goes on

Ey DENISE MEYER

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) - It

Dan Cooper still is alive,

he's prob-

ably laughing at ali the hoopla that

some people are raising over his dra-

matic airplane hijacking 11 years ago!

Thanksgiving eve.

The hoopla has been expensive for

Richard Tosaw, a retired lawyer and

former FBI agent from Ceres, Calit.,

who estimates he has paid $25,000 in

the past year in efforts to find the

enigmatic folk hero.

"I intend to search until I find

him." Tosaw said Wednesday after a

fruitless 2½ hours spent dragging the

Colurabia River near here.

Nov. 24, 1971, a man calling him-

self-Dan Cooper hijacked a Northwest

Airlines jet and then parachuted dut

oTer Southwest Washington with,

$220,000 he extorted from the airline.

Nothing has been found of Cooper

since, except for $5,800 in soggy $20

bills that a boy found on the shore of

the Columbia in February 1980.

The incident is the only unsolved

jetliner hijacking in U.S. history.

Tosaw, 57, says he has spent $125]

¡ a day for most of the past two weeksi

for a diver to drag the Columbia near!

the spot where 1I-year-old Brian In-i

gram, now of San Bernadiao, Calif.,

found the extorted bills.

"The plane went right over here,"

Tosaw said as he gestured toward thei

Columbia Wednesday afternoon.

"If!

we're lucky, we'll snag something.

We feel a chute is very snaggable.

Tosaw says the money that Piani

fougd surfaced when the Army C.fps'

i of Engineers dredged the river aad'

deposited silt on the bank.

Although Tosaw claims to be seri-

ous about finding Cooper's parachute

or other belongings, his hired diver is

dragging the river at a painstakingly

slow pace with a large steel rake at-

tached to a rope.

Tosaw says he is willing to invest

another. $25,000 to find a trace of

Cooper. He says he has written 100 of

the projected 150 pages of a book on

Cooper. He's publishing it himseif and

says the $4.50 paperback should be

available in stores in eight weeks.

Is Cooper still alive?

"If he could have undone his para-

chute and untied the money bag, I

think he could have made it," Tosaw

says.

"The water is so cold, though. !

rink he had military training, but'

that water is too cold to last more

than about three minutes. And you

can't swim very far in three minutes."

Portland, Oregon

December 20, 1982

The FBI has been informed that during a dredging operation

of the Columbia River. items were located that could have been portions

of a parachute and a money bag. There is speculation by some sources

that these items could be the parachute and money bag of D. Cooper,

the Northwest Airlines hijacker of November 24, 1971..

These items have not been made available to the FBI for

examination; however, from a description of them published by the

uems media, they do not conform with

the known description of the

parachute and money container with which Cooper exited the airplane:

RENEWED HIS PUBLICITY EFFORTS, AND THAT A WIRE SERVICE STORY WAS

GOING OUT REPORTING FINDINGS OF PORTIONS OF A PARACHUTE AND MONEY

SACK, PROBABLY THAT OF COOPER'S. PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE FINDINGS WERE

FURNISHED BY THE SOURCE. THE "EVIDENCE" CONSISTED OF NYLON CORD

WAS NO MONEY SACK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASE.

PORTLAND HAS CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO NEITHER INTERFERE WITH

TOSAW'S RIGHT TO PUBLISH A BOOK AND DO RESEARCH ON COOPER, NOR

The spelling and grammar contained in the letter from

Gentlemen:

I was studying the July 3rd edition of Northwest

Magazine's composite picture of the famous D.B. Cooper and

saw a very close resemblance to a student from one of my

old yearbooks. The coincidence that the name is almost the

same is probably why it may not be the hi-jacker; but the

sure looks like an older version of the man in the

yearbook. Sorry about the quality of the zerox picture,

the yearbook original is of a much better quality.

The D.B. Cooper tale with a 'ho-ho-ho'

I "anyone out there sil cares about

more than the carnival aspects of

"The Legend of D.B. Cooper," Signum

Books Ltd. of Portland has published a

paperback titled "Ba-Ha-Ha" - by

none other than "D.B. Cooper."

Cooper, if anyone can forget, was

the now-near-mythical skyjacker who

bailed out of a jetliner over southwest-

ern Washington on Nov. 24, 1971, tak-

ing with him $200,000 in ransom

money and creating a mystery yet to

be solved.

The FBI, however, considers the

perennial phantom dead. On Feb. 12,

1980, 8-year-old Brian Ingram, playing

along the Columbia River nine miles

northwest of Vancouver, Wash., found

three bundles containing weather-

beaten $20 bills in 12 packets. The

bills were traced to Cooper's haul, pre-

sumably scattered when the man bei-

lied into the ground.

"Ha-Ha-Ha" publishers, however,

refuse to let Cooper quietly mold, and

have resurrected his nom de plume to

create another mystery: Who wrote

the book, allegedly a semi-fictional,

first-person account of the incident?

According to publicist Ivars Bezde-

chi, executive producer of BOSCOM

Media Creations, " 'D.K. Cooper' is the

pen name of an Oregon writer whose

identity will be revealed in due time."

• This, of course, creates another

mystery - How many times can left-

overs be reheated?

The gimmick in this public rela-

tions ploy is that the book contains

seven clues that can lead a reader to

the location of Cooper's "Big Score." A

certificate on the back of the book,

Signum's first, promises $200,000 to

the person uncovering the alleged

trove.

Northwest poet.

' In 1967 Hanson received a fellow-

ship in writing as part of a Rockefeller

Foundation Grant to Reed in humani-

ties. In 1972, he received a commission

frcm the Asia Society (New York) for

translations of the poems of T'ang Dy-

na:ty poet Han Yu; in 1973-'74 the

Amy Lowell Traveling Poetry Scholar-

ship; in 1976-77 a National Endow-

ment for the Arts grant for poetry; and

another NEA award in 1981-'82.

A native of Idaho, Hanson has had

work published in 14 anthologies, and •

his poems appear regularly in national

magazines.

Reed was the first western liberal

arts college to receive an endowment

from the William R. Kenan Jr. Chari-

table Trust, established in 1966. The

distinguished professorship is perpetu-

al, one of 54 such grants awarded

since the program began.

Designed to enhance the quality

and effectiveness of teaching and the

teacher-student relationship at the un-

dergraduate level, the grants are given

directly to privately supported schools

of high academic standing.

Hanson has been a major contribu-

tor to the development of freshman

and sophomore humanities at Reed,.

where he teaches poetry.

As the anniversary of. November 24th approaches,

call for information about captioned case,

and. it is also

a time when many publicity stunts concerning COOPER are

conducted to further some commercial enterprise.

Among those persons frequently making news

releases and seeking publicity is RICHARD T. TOSAW 2415

The attached tele-

type sent to FBIHQ on 12/23/82, describes TOSAW and the nature

of his activity.

being an FBI Agent at one time and uses that association

to promote a book that he has written about COOPER.

facts are that TOSAW was an FBI Agent from 3/19/51 to 12/16/55,

approximately 30 years ago, and 16 years before the. NORJAK

incident occurred.

On 11/20/85, SA

received a phone call

from a television station in Canada indicating that IOSAW

had reported to. the TV station that he was

"re-opening the

D. B. COOPER investigation based on new evidence that he

had found."

The television station was not aware that TOSAW

had not been an FBI Agent since 30 years ago.

The above information and the attached teletype,

which is self-explanatory, are provided to assist in the

answering of any impromptu questions concerning TOSAW and

his activities.

very year about this time it happens

and West Linn resident Ralph Himmelsbach is

getting accustomed to the phone calls and the

tips that often are dead ends for investigators.

But this year it was different. The certified

letter that arrived at his Marylhurst-area home

three weeks ago and the phone call the next

day from the letter writer all had the markings

of something more interesting than a routine

dead end.

After years of chasing the notorious sky-

jacker known to law enforcement agencies only

as "Dan Cooper," Himmelsbach might have a

real suspect in the case.

Although some of the information about the -

latest in what seemed like thousands of Dan

cooper suspects was a bit sketchy, flir

melsbach was obviously interested, A former

criminal investigator not given to false hopes

or empty encouragement, Himmelsbach said

last week that the most recent suspect had

some "very compelling" features that seemed

to match a profile of the skyjacking suspect.

"I don't know who D.B. Cooper was, but I

have had several very attractive suspects in

the past few years," Himmelsbach said.

In mid-November, almost 14 years to the day

of the skyjacking, a registered letter arrived at

Jimmelsbach's home outlining a suspect #ho,

; he said, seemed to fit many parts oi the

description of D.B. Cooper.

'I don't know who

D.B. Cooper was,

but l have had

some suspects in

the past few years'

The letter was followed by a telephone call

from the same person, saying that he or she

had a close relative who fit the D.B. Cooper

description, Himmelsbach said. The suspect

lives in the Portland area, but Himmelsbach

declined to identify either the suspect or the

person who brought the suspect to his attention.

Himmelsbach said he turned the information

over to the local FBI office, which investigates

each new lead to the case.

"It does look pretty good," Himmelsbach

said. "The person fits some very compelling

parts of the person we think was D.B. Cooper.

The tip was one of about 100 Himmelsbach

and the local FBI office receive every

November when the area media focus on the

infamous event. Nearly all the tips are in

vestigated, and people pointed to as suspects

usually are cleared by the FBI, Himmelsbach

said.

Dan Cooper dropped Into criminal

folklore Nov. 21, 1971, when be hijacked a Nor-

thwest Airlines' jet on a routine flight between

Portland and Seattle. Cooper said he had a

bomb in a briefcase that he would detonate if

he was not paid $200,000 in ransore.

(Himmelsbach speculated that the bomb was

actually highway flares wired to a 1.5-volt bat-

tery. The bob was never found.)

Cooper demanded that the ransom be paid in

$20 bills. A hundred bundles of the bills —

10,000 in all - were paid through a Seattle

bank that kept up to $240,000 on hand as a

humanitarian fund to pay kidnappers and other

extortionists.

After a quick 3l-minute flight to Seattle,

Cooper allowed three dozen passengers to get

off the plane and asked that it be refueled to fly

to Mexico City. Cooper also asked for four

parachutes and that the pilot leave a rear

"airstairs" door open during the plane's

takeoff from Seattle Tacoma Airport.

The pilot, Capt. William A. Scott, convinced

Cooper that the plane would not be able to take

off with the door open, so Cooper agreed to

open it after the plane was in flight. He ordered

Scott to fly the plane at 10,000 feet, no faster

than 170 knots (195 miles per hour) and with

the plane's flaps lowered by 15 degrees.

After takeoff at about 7:45 p.m. from Seattle,

the plane flew for about 28 minutes when

Cooper apparently parachuted into the cold and

rainy night over Washington with the bank bag

of $20 bilis strapped to his waist.

No trace of Cooper was ever found and he

has never been identified.

RALPH HIMMELSBACH

..:

ccording to Himmelsbach's proile,

Dan Cooper was & man of medium build,

described by airline employees as being in his

"mid-40s (probably 48),'

with slick black hair

and "sparkling, piercing, and very dark eyes.

He also was a man with a criminal background

who probably suffered a severe leg or lower-

body injury when he landed in the mountains of

southwestern Washington.

Because of the type of parachute he used,

and because Cooper did not have adequate

equipment to make a jump at night in minus-?

degree weather against winds of up to 200 miles

per hour, Himmelsbach said Cooper probably

hit the ground "going about 55 miles per hour."

'I don't have a shred

of admiration for

the hijacker. He

was not bold or

courageous

If that did not kill Cooper, Himmelsbach said it

more than likely injured him severely.

Although he calls his observations "just

speculation," Himmelsbach said the recent

suspect was 56 years old (D.B. Cooper would be

about 62 this year), had come into a large

amount of money in the early 1970s, had a

"serious injury contemporaneous with the hi-

jacking,

" and disappeared for a long period of

time in late 1971.

The suspect also had a long criminal histor

and was "a loner," Himmelsbach said, which

made him all the more attractive.

"I have felt for years that most likely we are

looking for an ex-con, maybe someone has been

involved with the law most of his life," Him-

melsbach said.

"There are some suspects who come your

way with only one fact that makes it appear

they should be a suspect. You have got to be

willing to look at anybody, but if you get a guy

who turns up with a limp, a lot of money, arc

he's been missing for a long time around (th

time of the hijacking), then it looks pretty

good."

Himmelsbach, 59, a retired Federal Bureau

of Investigation agent from the Portland field

office, spent the last nine years of his FBI

career chasing down leads to Dan Cooper.

He retired from the bureau in February 1980,

but Himmelsbach did not retire from the chase.

He has worked with Clackamas-area author

Tom Worcester on a 15-chapter, 190-page book

cy of Americans.

Himmelsbach's book should be published

next year, Worcester said. A draft of the bool

s being edited, and several püblisher's hav

een contacted, but no offers have been mad

he said.

"We may just have to publish it ourselves."

this September, Himmelsbach was an in

police agencies in the state.

Himmelsbach is a handsome and polite man

whose smooth voice booms with authority and

excitement as he recounts with stunning ac

curacy names, dates, physical features and

other attributes of suspects he has faced and

interesting tidbits of information on cases he

has investigated.

He is clearly a man who enjoyed his 28 years

and 10 months as an FBI agent and his four

years as an investigator for the state Justice

Department

He is also a man who is clearly annoyed at

the glamour given to D.B. Cooper's escapades

- the same glamour that produced a number

of books, magazine and newspaper articles,

and even a Hollywood movie, about the inci-

dent.

It's unfortunate, Himmeisbach said, but

because Americans tend to cheer for the under-

dog, Dan Cooper has become a symbol of an

air pirate who got away with $200,000 in ran-

som money and who has yet to be identified or

prosecuted for the crime.

It's that mystique that has people in the

Pacific Northwest marking the November an-

niversary of the Skyjacking each year with par

ties and speculation. It's also that mystique

that has made Himmelsbach famous for what

he called his "biggest failure."

"It's the only unsolved skyjacking case of its

kind in the world," Himmelsbach said. "Here's

a guy who reaches up and tweeks Uncle Sam's

nose and steals $200,000 and possibly gets away

with it. People are looking at it from the stand

point that nobody got injured. Everyone on that

plane escaped Whole, maybe some with some

psychological scars.

The statute of limitations on Cooper's crime

• has not run out because a federal Grand Jury

in Portland indicted Cooper in 1976 on two

counts of air piracy and violation of the Hobbs

Act, which deals with extortion and hindering

interstate commerce.

D.B. Cooper might not ever be captured,

however, because Himmelsbach does not

believe he survived the 10,000-foot plunge with

an Army parachute that could have failed dur-

"I didn't catch him, but I think he's still lying

close to where he fell because that's where he

Only two pieces of evidence have ever been

found in the case - a plastic sign explaining

Tosaw also offered a $10,000 reward to

anyone who could produce one of the ransom's

$20 bills. His 180-page book includes 56 pages of

serial numbers taken from photocopies of the

ransom money that the FBI keeps on file.

No one has claimed the reward money.

immelsbach said the search for Cooper

probably would go on, no matter what the

evidence pointed to. Last week, Mimmelsbach

received a telephone call from a reporter for

the "Star Magazine" in New York City who

said a man in jail in that state claimed to be

: D.B. Cooper.

The man's attorney, to whom Himmelsbach

, has spoken, said the suspect was in his 40s,

jet from which Cooper parachuted, and $5,800

in $20 billis (294 of therm) that was uncovered in

Feb. 10, 1980, on the bank of the Columbia -

River near Vancouver - and numerous sear-

ches of mountainous and wooded areas between

Portland and Ariel, Wash., about 30 miles north

of Portland where Cooper was believed to have

landed, have yielded few clues about the sky-

jacking.

Speciation about the case led author,

Max Gunther to write the book "D.B. Cooper:

What Really Happened," in which he said a

woman who identified herself only as "Clara"

told him that Cooper was actually a man nam-

ed Dan Laclair who died recently of a heart at-

tack.

Gunther's book, which was published this

fall, told the story of how Clara found

Cooper/Laclair injured in her tool shed in a

rural area of southwestern Washington and

nursed him back to health. Clara and Laclair

' then took the money to Nevada where they

"laundered" it by gambling in casinos, Gun

ther wrote.

In his book, Gunther also claired that

Laclair called him' on the telephone from New

York where he was living

"I do not believe that story," Himmeisbach

said..

When Himmelsbach met with Gunther two

years ago to discuss the proposed book, he

believed Clara's story was a hoax, and his opi-

nion has not changed.

"I do not accuse Max Gunther of perper-

trating a hoax, but I do think the story is false,

for a number of reasons," Himmelsbach said.

In another book, published in 1984, former

FBI agent Richard Tosaw claimed that

Cooper drowned after he plunged into the Col-

umbia River. Tosaw has spent several years

searching for Cooper's remains in or near the

тішат.

RE: MERLIN GENE COOPER, Subject Number 1002.

Re Portland teletype to FBIHQ, 4/26/88.

Referenced teletype advised MERLIN GENE COOPER has been

developed as a suspect by the Portland Division. Suspect

resided in Pendleton, Oregon, in 1970 through 1972.

He left

for two weeks during

the time of the hijacking on 11/24/71.

He returned injured; walking with a limp.

MERLIN GENE COOPER's description fits the general

physical description of

the unknown subject.

In 1972, he

gave a painting to a Pendleton resident signing the name

"D.B. Cooper". At least two individuals who knew him

personally through family associations thought he was D.B.

COOPER at the time the composite sketch came out in the

newspapers in 1971, but were reluctant to contact law

enforcement authorities:

The suspect has been assigned air

tratiic control duties in past military assignments.

autopsy at the time of death two years after the hijacking

showed suspect had a contusion below the knee from a prior

injury.

me that he had lots of money waiting for him on the out-

side. That statment in and of itself does not mean any-

from a tri-state area where Montana, Wyomina and South

Dakota come together. He was serving time l

On 5/2/88,

Madison Police Department (MPD)

Records, Madison,

Wisconsin,

reviewed MPD records for MERLIN GENE

COOPER

and advised that COOPER was arrested on 2/6/59 for

issuing worthless checks. At the time of his 2/4/61 arrest,

COOPER listed a permanent residence address of 13718 Graystone,

Norwalk, California.

Jadvised that the arrest reports for the above

offenses were microfilmed and the original reports destroyed.

The microfilm printer for the format in which these records were

copied was now broken and repair parts were no longer available.

The film was therefore sent to the University of Wisconsin

Media Laboratory for transfer to a more modern format.

Copies

of the actual reports were finally obtained on 5/19/88. A review

of these reports indicates COOPER, in addition to writing

worthless checks, was wanted for non-support in LaCrosse,

Wisconsin. No information is contained in the records identifying

any of COOPER'S relatives.

COOPER did serve one year at the

Wisconsin State Penitentiary at Waupun, Wisconsin.

On 5/19/88, a review of birth records at the Wisconsin

Bureau of Vital Statistics, Madison, Wisconsin, determined that

COOPER was born 7/8/34 to SILAS BYRON COOPER and ORPHA GRIFFIN

in the

"Well, for heaven's sake, look at this." MILLER advised

D.B. Cooper?

O The FBI is tracing the

path of a man who

disappeared at the same

time as the hijacking to see

if he committed the crime

By ROBERTA ULRICH

ol The Oregonian stall

The FBI is investigating the possibility

that a man recently arrested in the 1971

killing of his family is the elusive airline

hijacker known as D.B. Cooper.

The man, John E. List, vanished Nov/

1971, the day authorities believe his m

er, wife and three children were sh

death in the family's home at Wes

N.J. That was just 15 days before

hijacked a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727

at Portland International Airport and

parachuted into the dark and subzero tem•

peratures over Southwestern Washington

with $200,000 in cash.

No trace of Cooper was ever found, but

about $6,000 in tattered, water-soaked $20

bills from the hijack ransom turned up

along the Columbia River near Vancouver,

Wash., in 1980. The case remains the only

unsolved hijacking in U.S. history,

List "is no more of a suspect than any of

the other people who come up from time to

time," John Eyer, assistant agent in charge

of the FBI office in Seattle, said Thursday.

"We are investigating to see if he is a

viable suspect.*

List waived extradition and was flown

Thursday from Richmond, Va., to New Jer-

sey, where he was held in the Union Coun-

ty Jail at Elizabeth charged with five

counts of murder. Authorities there said

Friday they do not know where List was at

the time the Cooper hijacking occurred.

Eyer acknowledged that List had been

considered a possible suspect shortly after'

the hijacking because of the New Jersey

killings and the fact that he had disap-

"Our interest in him as a potentiali

suspect has been rekindled" as a result of

his arrest, Eyer said.

However, Ralph Himmelsbach, the

retired FBI agent from Portland who

sought Cooper from the night of the hijack-

in was he red in so, said friday it,

would say he's a major suspect or, at least,

I would consider him a major suspect.'

After first hearing about the new devel

opment Thursday, Himmelsbach said "He

definitely looks good to me. He fits the pro-

ile, the description. He's the kind of a guy

with nothing to lose. ... He does bear :

THE CRIME

On November 24, 1971, a lone white male

boarded Northwest Orient

Flight #305 at Portland.

Oregon. At approximately 3:22 P.M., while the flight

was en route to Seattle, Washington, he indicated to

the stewardess that his brief case contained a bomb

which would blow up the plane unless his demands were

The hijacker demanded $200,000 and four

parachutes in exchange for the safety of the 36

passengers aboard the plane. When the aircraft landed

After he received the

parachutes and the money, the hijacker allowed all

passengers and two airline stewardesses to deplane.

He then ordered the remaining crew members

into the first-class section of the, aircraft and

informed them he desired to fly to Mexico City. The

hijacker instructed that the plane proceed in a

southerly direction and fly at a low altitude and slow

speed which would enable the rear door of the plane

Speculative book on

D.B. Cooper identity

stirs court action

The Associated Press

SALT LAKE CITY - A judge

issued a temporary restraining.

order this week, prohibiting sale of a

book claiming a Utah man was the

legendary skyjacker D.B. Cooper.

But at an emergency Utah

Supreme Court hearing a few hours

later, an attorney for plaintift Karen

Burns McCoy withdrew the request

for the temporary restraining order.

In the book, "D.B. Cooper: The

Real McCoy," co-authors Russell

Calame and Bernie Rhodes say

Cooper was really the late Provo

skyjacker Richard Floyd McCoy.

The book was published in Septem-

ber by the University of Utah Press.

Those who investigated the Coop-

fer hijacking were skeptical of the

book's claim. The book stems from

an incident Nov. 24, 1971, in which a

man calling himself D.B. Cooper

hijacked a Boeing 727 during a flight

from Portland to Seattle. He

demanded $200,000 in $20 bills and

four parachutes.

After the plane landed in Seattle,

he released the 36 passengers and

some of the crew in exchange for the

ransom. Cooper ordered the crew to

fly to Reno, Nev. Over southwest

Washington, near the Oregon bor-

der, Cooper opened an exit door and

jumped. He has never been located

and his body was never found.

McCoy was convicted of a 1972

hijacking in which he bailed out

over Provo with $500,000. He escaped

from prison and was shot to death

by FBl agents.

McCoy's widow, Karen Burns

sought the court order claiming the

book is full of lies and violates her

night to privacy.

Burns filed a lawsuit in 3rd Dis-

trict Court on Jan. 3, asking for

unspecified damages and a jury

After a hearing Tuesday, David

Watkiss, attorney for the authors,

said he was outraged at 3rd District

Judge Homer Wilkinson's order.

Watkiss went immediately from

that court to the Utah Supreme

Court. He was granted an emergen-

cy hearing and after arguments,

McCoy's attorney, Michael Morh-

man, withdrew the request.

Watkiss said the order was vague!

and a clear violation of the First

Amendment.

I am mystified," Watkiss said

"There was no justification for it as

far I can tell. The book is out and it

will remain out. One wonders what

the point of an injunction against

the authors is when the book is out."

The book is in its second printing

and about 3,000 copies have been

sold to wholesalers and individuals,
