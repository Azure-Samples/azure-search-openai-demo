On 1/7/72, witness CORD SPRECKEL, 624 Yale Avenue

North, seattle, washington; telephone 623-2984 was displayed

a photograph of WILLIAM FRANCIS JOHNSTON, SR.

SPRECKEL

said that based on the photograph displayed him he could not

positively eliminate JOHNSTON as a possible suspect in this

matter.

SPRECKEL said that although JOHNSTON appears to be

too young to be the hijacker he declined to eliminate JOHNSTON

as SPRECKEL did not know how old the photograph of JOHNSTON

was.

he returned to his office and checked his records which

showed that an inaividual by the name of sessin

He felt that it was particularly peculiar that the hijacker

had used the name D. B. COOPER and felt that the similar

Pacific Northwest.

On 11-26-71, CWO W. A. YOAST, District Court Guard

Office, Seattle, advised that JAMES DWIGHT BOOTH, born on

12-1-27, Duluth, Minnesota, was issued Coast Guard Z: No.

At this time, BOOTH

had given an address of Box 1116 Cut Bank, Montana.

BOOTH's coast guard papers described him as qualified as

a Fireman, Water tender, Oiler, Mess man, General Engineer

and Deck Engineer.

In June, 1964, BOOTH was issued a Chief

Engineers license

in San Francisco and he renewed this license

in Seattle in June, 1969.

This license entitled BOOTH to

the rating of Chief Engineer

Social Security Account Number 473-22-5691.

Attached hereto is a xerox copy of a form used by

BOOTH when applying for his duplicate 7 Number on 4-17-57

an exceptionally good likeness. He further noted

strong similarities in the high cheekbones, the long nose,

and eyes as he remembered the hijacker.

He was unable to determine from the photograph

the complexion of CATALANO but again emphasized the hi-

jacker had a swarthy or Latin type complexion and it appeared

to him CATALANO might have such a complexion.

He would

prefer to see a color photograph and additional photographs
