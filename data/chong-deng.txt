My specialism is robotics and automation and I’ve been interested in this area since starting my engineering studies. It is rapidly-changing and the more recent addition of soft robotics and AI powered robots are massively increasing the scope of work possible.My research interests include soft robotics, artificial-intelligence-powered robots, and automation systems for agriculture and the food industry.The practical application of robotics into New Zealand companies has brought me many customer projects and despite what you see in the movies, not all robots are terminators…!BackAreas of expertiseRobotics and AutomationSoft RoboticsAI-powered RobotsEducationPhD, Mechatronics Engineering, University of Auckland, 2019Memberships and awardsIEEE MemberMechanical Engineering Group (MEG) MemberSelected publications"A smart grasping system for handling regular, naturally varying objects", Z.
