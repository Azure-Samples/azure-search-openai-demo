My expertise spans mechanical design, high pressure vessels, and hydrogen reactor design and build for scientific and commercial applications. I work on innovation and problem-solving for Clean and Green technologies that reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I am driven by the desire to contribute to advancements in technology, science, and society, ensuring a better future for the coming generations.My inspiration comes from Nicola Tesla, whose groundbreaking contributions to science and engineering have left an indelible mark on the world. One of my proudest achievements was my critical intervention at Philips Semiconductors Phil. Inc. Where I rescued a multi-million-dollar technological product line, SOD110, from the brink of closure, safeguarding the livelihoods of the department's personnel and reinforcing my belief in the power of determination and expertise to drive positive change.During my time at Callaghan Innovation, I have made scientific and technological innovations that significantly impact both industry and research institutions. Witnessing my ideas and research translate into practical and commercially viable solutions brings immense satisfaction, fusing scientific excellence with market success is a winning strategy.In my research, I have published on topics including the reduction of Titanomagnetite Ironsand in a Fluidized Bed Reactor and the development of experimental rigs for New Zealand Titanomagnetite Ironsand processing.BackAreas of expertiseConcept-Design-Build-Commissioning of Experimental Rigs and LabsHydrogen Reactors and High Pressure VesselsProcess developmentGood manufacturing practice (GMP)Semiconductor technology & manufactureInstrumentation and control engineeringMass & pressureMathematical modellingExperimental physics, Design, PrototypingRobotics and automation, Electrical, MechanicalEducationBachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering, University of Nueva Caceres, Naga City, 1988Memberships and awardsPhil.
