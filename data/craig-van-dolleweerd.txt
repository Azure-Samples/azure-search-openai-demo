As a molecular biologist, I have worked on bacterial, plant and mammalian recombinant protein expression systems. I have expertise in the engineering and expression of antibodies and novel antibody formats, with a particular interest in using plants as a biotechnology platform for recombinant protein production. This work has led me into the field of synthetic biology, which uses principles of modularity and reusability to construct novel biological systems.One of my significant contributions has been the delivery of a modular DNA assembly platform for synthetic biology (MIDAS) that offers a versatile and efficient method for constructing complex genetic circuits for the co-expression of multiple proteins, and the engineering of metabolic pathways for the production of high value secondary metabolites and commodity chemicals.My work continues to focus on developing novel synthetic biology tools for efficient assembly of biomolecular systems that have applications in metabolic pathway engineering, immunology and other multi-protein systems.By harnessing the power of synthetic biology, we can produce complex biological systems that have the potential to revolutionise the healthcare, agritech, energy and chemical industries and improve their sustainability and accessibility.BackAreas of expertiseSynthetic biologyModular DNA assemblyMultigene assemblyMetabolic pathway engineeringRecombinant protein expression and purificationAntibody engineering, expression and purificationImmunological techniques (ELISA, western blotting)EducationBSc (Biochemistry and Cellular & Molecular Biology), University of Auckland, NZ (1986)MSc (Plant Molecular Biology), University of Auckland, NZ (1989)PhD (Immunology) King's College London, UK (2002)Selected publicationsModular DNA Assembly System. van Dolleweerd CJ, Parker EJ, Nicholson MJ Patent (2019) PCTA WO2019064242.MIDAS: A Modular DNA Assembly System for Synthetic Biology. van Dolleweerd CJ, Kessans SA, Van de Bittner KC, Bustamante LY, Bundela R, Scott B, Nicholson MJ, Parker EJ.
