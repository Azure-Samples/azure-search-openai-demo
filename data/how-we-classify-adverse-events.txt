classify adverse eventsThe Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) classifies adverse events (which include natural disasters, severe weather, and biosecurity incursions) as either localised, medium-, or large-scale events.What is an adverse event?Adverse events may include:stormsdroughtsfloodssnow stormsvolcanic eruptionsearthquakesbiosecurity incursions.How MPI assesses eventsMPI assesses each adverse event based on the:options available for farmers to prepare for the event   magnitude of the event (likelihood and scale of the physical impact)capacity of the community to cope (economic and social impact).When an adverse event occurs, MPI consults with:regional policy agentsrural support trustsrelevant regional and district councilsregional civil defence emergency management groupsindustry organisationsother government agencies.Based on the information collected, MPI advises the Minister of Agriculture on the scale of the event, and the Government decides what support to provide. An adverse event may be declared a civil defence emergency by a local council.Find out what help is available for your type of adverse eventPrimary Sector Recovery Policy This policy sets out the Government's recovery assistance for farmers following an adverse event.
