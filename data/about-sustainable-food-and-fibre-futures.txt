It could be eligible for funding through Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures (SFF Futures). SFF Futures videoMake it happen – bring your ideas to life (2.14)Transcript - show/hideNarrator: "Every innovation, every leap forward, every new way of doing something, starts with an idea."Often that’s the easy part. The real challenge is bringing it to life."Now there’s a way to make that easier. A way to connect with others, to help explore and discover new perspectives, new opportunities, and new ways of doing things. A way to collaborate and take ideas from "it’s possible" to "we did it". A way to shift gear and meet our challenges head on and create a richer future for our mokopuna."A way to get behind those with big ideas… and even bigger aspirations. To give flight to truly transformative initiatives being developed for the benefit and prosperity of the collective good – for our sectors, our people, our environment and our country."SFF Futures is a new investment programme from the Ministry for Primary Industries designed to back new game-changing innovations across the food and fibre sectors. With an annual budget of $40 million and the scope to co-fund projects under $100,000 to over $5 million, SFF Futures offers investment opportunities for innovative initiatives at every level from small grassroots community projects to large-scale industry development."The food and fibre sectors need new ideas and we want to help bring them to life. We need to keep pace with the changing world around us, to improve sustainability, to deliver more value, and to position ourselves as global leaders in our sectors."If you have an idea – big or small – that you think New Zealand needs, talk with us now, and let's see how we can go about making it happen."SFF Futures. Make it happen."[End of transcript]Co-investment at every levelSFF Futures can provide support at any level on a co-investment basis.

Sense Partners completed the report in February 2024. The economists involved brought decades of experience in primary sector economic analyses and assessments of public projects’ value for money.The modelling estimated that the portfolio will produce $4.3 billion in net present-valued benefits over the next 30 years, a 9-times return on investment. Benefits could be as high as $6.1 billion after 30 years, a 13-times return on investment. Benefits from Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures funding (Sense Partners February 2024)  [PDF, 763 KB]How much funding is available through SFF Futures?Up to $75 million is available each year. There are 2 categories of funding – 'Partnerships' and 'Grants'. MPI's investment will be aligned to the length and complexity of your project. Although there are minimum co-investment requirements, there is no specific cap on government investment per project. If you're not sure which category your project falls into, MPI will work with you to find the best approach.When we need your business caseBusiness cases are required for partnership applicants that pass the first stage of assessment. We can give you advice on your business case but we expect you to fund its development yourself. We may consider providing funding assistance in exceptional circumstances.Your business case will be reviewed by the SFF Futures Independent Advisory Panel before MPI makes its final recommendation.MPI makes the final decision for all funding up to $1 million (of MPI contribution). The Minister of Agriculture makes decisions for all MPI funding of $1 million or over, informed by an MPI recommendation.SFF Futures Investment Advisory Panel and its membersWhen we need an outcome logic modelWhere MPI's contribution is $2 million or more, applicants that have passed the first stage of assessment must also complete an outcome logic model. Logic models are narrative or graphical depictions of a process, showing the activities that need to happen to achieve a specific result. Logic models link the problem (situation), the intervention (inputs and outputs), and the impact (outcome).Capital expenditure funding restrictionsFunding cannot be used for capital expenditure purchases that subsidise commercial operations. However, it can be used for pilot capital expenditure purchases like enabling new product development or making a prototype.If you think you’ll need funding for capital expenditure, email us to find out whether your project is eligible.Our email is sff.futures@mpi.govt.nzPast annual reviews of SFF Futures SFF Futures Annual Review Snapshot October 2018-May 2020  [PDF, 1.8 MB] SFF Futures Annual Review Snapshot June 2020-May 2021  [PDF, 6.2 MB] FeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
