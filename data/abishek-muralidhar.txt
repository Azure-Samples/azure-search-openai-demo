I am a trained molecular biologist, biochemist and microbiologist with experience in different aspects of commercial product development, going from conception to launch. I enjoy the challenge of working on varied projects with different requirements and seeing my team’s work make a real world impact.I have always been fascinated by the biochemical processes that help organisms survive and thrive in different habitats. My role enables me to apply this fundamental fascination and understanding of these processes to different projects as well as work with talented and inspiring people along the way. My previous research has focussed on recombinant protein bioprocess and assay development for point-of-care diagnostic devices for SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) and tuberculosis detection. Some of the other areas I have worked on include screening for high value enzymes from extremophilic organisms, understanding plant microbial interactions, and studying abiotic stresses in algae and plants.BackAreas of expertiseExtraction of nucleic acids and proteins from different substratesPurification and functional characterization, analysis of proteins and enzymesBioprocess developmentMolecular cloning and expression of proteins of interestPolymerase Chain Reaction, Quantitative PCR and RT-qPCR assay design and developmentIsolation and culturing of bacteria, archaea, fungi and algae from different habitatsGenomic and metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysisPlant-microbial interactions, study of plant growth promoting and pathogenic microbesAbiotic stress tolerance in algae and plantsEducationDoctor of Philosophy; Ecology; University of Canterbury, New Zealand; 2014Post Graduate Diploma; Biological Sciences; University of Auckland, New Zealand; 2010Master of Science; Applied Microbiology; VIT University, Vellore, India; 2009Bachelor of Science; Plant Biology and Biotechnology; University of Madras, Chennai, India; 2007Selected publicationsMuralidhar, A., Broady, P.A., MacIntyre, D.P., Wilcox, M.D., Garrill, A. and Novis, P.M (2014).
