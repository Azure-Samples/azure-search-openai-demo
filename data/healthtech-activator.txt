The session gave us a whole framework for market validation – how to schedule and conduct customer interviews to really test our assumptions and avoid the typical mistakes startups make."Ilya VenskyCEO, Helico"The HealthTech Activator has run amazing programmes and given us amazing access to grants, information, insights, programmes, referrals, and all their networks that they have so graciously pulled us into and shared with us. "HanieCOO, Alimetry"We've been really fortunate to be one of the first organisations to be able to work with the HealthTech Activator. So, for about two and a half years we've been involved with workshops, webinars, and it's been incredibly beneficial to our company. Something that was very helpful for us was a market validation workshop. It was led by a world-leading expert and other companies in the workshop were really inspiring. We were able to come away with plans that were useful to us right in that particular part of our journey.The HealthTech Activator helped us to navigate quite a complex landscape. They helped us to understand what we needed to do, when we needed to do it, and who we needed to speak to."Dr Elizabeth BerrymanCEO & founder, chnnlSuccess storiesPrevNext1 / 2Customer storyHeartLab: Getting a jump start to help fight heart disease                                                                                                            Heart disease is one of the world’s most preventable causes of death.
