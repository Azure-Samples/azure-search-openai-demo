My team brings clarity to Callaghan’s financial performance, better aligning our strategy to investment, and identifying areas where we should be investing more to deliver greater impact.My career started at KPMG, before moving into the telecommunications sector and spending nearly eight years working for Chorus NZ. I very intentionally moved from the private sector into the public sector, to bring my strategic and financial management skills towards supporting the effective use of public funding and, ultimately, support the achievement of greater impact from our public services. It was a move away from a sole focus on profit and continuous growth, and into a more important balancing of people and planet with profit.I take inspiration from people that are rethinking hard wired models of how things are currently run, turning things on their head, rethinking “value”, and how value needs to be generated for a sustainable future.BackAreas of expertiseFinancial managementCommercial management Business planningStrategic leadershipOrganisational culture and leadership Business transformationChange and continuous improvementSimplifying complexitySystems thinkingEducationBachelor of Business Studies, majoring in Accountancy, Massey University, 1996Memberships and awardsMember of Chartered Accountants Australia and New ZealandBreakthrough Leaders Programme, Global Women, 2019ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
