My Ph.D. is in construction materials research and my principal research interest is developing sustainable binders and enhancing the longevity of concrete structures.My professional drive stems from the desire to create a tangible impact on the construction industry by reducing the carbon footprint of construction projects. I firmly believe that through my work, I can make a positive contribution to society and help build a more sustainable future for our planet.I have successfully guided the development of innovative ideas and played a pivotal role in their commercialisation. From the initial concept to market implementation, I thrive in transforming groundbreaking research into practical solutions that address real-world challenges.Concrete, as the most widely used construction material globally, captures my attention. With nearly 25 billion tons used each year, there is huge potential to optimise its composition and properties to align with global sustainability goals. I am proud to have received recognition, including the Best Paper Award at the ICE Advances in Cement Research Prize and the Early Career Researcher Award from Science NZ. BackAreas of expertiseCement ChemistryConcrete DurabilityMaterials CharacterisationAlternate BindersCarbon Dioxide SequestrationEducationBachelors in Civil Engineering, S.V.NIT, Surat, India 2012Masters in Construction Engineering and Management, IIT Delhi, Delhi India, 2014PhD in Construction Materials, IIT Delhi, Delhi India, 2018Postgraduate Diploma in Environmental Management, Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand, 2022Memberships and awardsBest Paper Award, ICE Advances in Cement Research Prize, 2021Early Career Researcher Award, Science NZ, 2022KiwiNet Emerging Innovator, 2023Member, Concrete NZSelected publicationsShah V., Mackechnie J. and Scott A., “Determination of carbonation resistance of concrete through a combination of cement content and tortuosity”, Journal of Building Engineering, Vol. 60(15), 2022Shah V. and Scott A., “Pozzolanic characteristics of silica recovered from olivine”, Construction and Building Materials, Vol. 332, 2022Shah V. and Scott A., “Hydration and microstructure characteristics of MgO in the presence of metakaolin and silica fume”, Cement and Concrete Composites, Vol. 121, 2021Shah V., Parashar A., Mishra G., Medepalli S., Krishnan S. and Bishnoi S., "Influence of Cement Replacement by Limestone Calcined Clay Pozzolan on the Engineering Properties of Mortar and Concrete", Advances in Cement Research, Vol. 32(3), 2020Shah V., Scrivener K., Bhattacharjee B. and Bishnoi S., "Changes in microstructure characteristics of cement paste on carbonation", Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 109, 2018ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
