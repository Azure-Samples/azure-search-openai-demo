In 2016, I obtained our first licence from the Ministry of Health (MoH) when we began seeing early interest from the industry. With the support of internal funding, we have established expertise in decarboxylation, extraction, and downstream processing of hemp and cannabis materials to produce high cannabinoid-containing products. This has positioned us as the leading research provider in New Zealand for cannabis processing and product development, leading to numerous collaborations, commercial contracts, and international recognition.Part of my responsibilities include the regulatory compliance for Callaghan Innovation’s Ministry of Primary Industries approved food manufacturing programmes as well as the Ministry of Health approved License to Deal in Controlled Drugs.My dedication to innovation in biotechnology process engineering stems from my passion for sustainable and efficient utilisation of biological resources. Alongside my colleagues, we strive to develop novel solutions that optimise production processes, improve product quality, and adhere to regulatory standards.BackAreas of expertiseSupercritical fluid extractionHigh pressure processingNatural product extraction and fractionationCannabis processingFood technologyFood safetyFormulationEducationPhD ProcessEngineering, University of Valladolid (Spain), 2011Memberships and awardsMember of the Science Leadership Group of the Bioresource Processing Alliance (BPA) https://bioresourceprocessing.co.nz/Selected publicationsPost-extraction processes.
