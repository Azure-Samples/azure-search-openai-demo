They also meet International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC) guidelines.BackContactshttps://www.everedgeglobal.com/Paul Adams, CEOp.adams@everedgeglobal.com+64 21 393 673https://www.everedgeglobal.com/Dean Prebble, Director dean.prebble@everedgeglobal.com+64 21 839 424https://www.everedgeglobal.com/Richard Barnett, Senior Managerr.barnett@everedgeglobal.com+64 21 550 847Sector experienceFood and beverageManufacturingAgriTechDigitalSoftwareHealthEnergy and environmentTransport and logisticsBiotech, medtech, organic chemistry, and chemicalTelecommunication and ICTFinancial servicesConsumer productsCapital goods Commercial and professional services Data servicesElectronicsSector expertiseIntangible asset identification Intangible asset assessment Protection strategy Commercialisation strategy Valuation Unlocking valueM&A and corporate finance services  Working with us onBeyond IPRelated ProductsPrevNext1 / 1Beyond IPEnhance and protect the things that make your business unique, and give you a competitive advantage, with this 12-month coaching and strategy building programme.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
