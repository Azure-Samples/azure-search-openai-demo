My expertise is in the rapid design and development of smart electromechanical devices. As a research engineer, I provide design and prototyping services to innovative companies and contribute to internal research initiatives. My background is in Mechatronics and Bioengineering, particularly in stroke rehabilitation robotics. For me, the three Cs - Coffee, Coffee, and the ‘Challenge Of Forever Fetching Engineering Excellence’ - fuel my passion for work. I find great satisfaction in solving complex problems and am motivated by others who also pursue the process of learning, inventing, and creating. I achieved distinction in my Masters while also working for Callaghan Innovation part-time. This gave me invaluable industry knowledge and also allowed me the flexibility to balance work and study. It was a transformative experience.If you have an interest in mechatronics or are intrigued by its seemingly magical nature, I encourage you to explore the field further. A great starting point is to buy a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, and try simple projects like making an LED flash or printing a "hello world" message to the serial port. It is never too late or the wrong time to acquire new skills and expand your horizonsI am passionate about mechatronics and its potential to transform industries and improve lives. I see advancements daily which contribute to the progress of society.BackAreas of expertiseRapid prototyping (MVP)High level problem solvingResearch and investigative workFull system designEmbedded hardware / software developmentMicrocontroller ImplementationSensor fusion & smart sensing systemsElectrical design3D PrintingEducationM.Eng, Bioengineering, University of Canterbury, 2020B.Eng, Mechatronics, University of Canterbury, 2018Selected publicationsGnarometer Surfcam Live Inspector, S.
