I also work on collaborative robotics, which involves the seamless integration of human operators and robots to enhance productivity and safety in the workplace. My work creates robotics systems that complement human capabilities in collaborative manufacturing.Our sophisticated robotic simulation models envision and optimise robot behaviour in complex scenarios before implementing them in the real world. This significantly reduces risks and accelerates the development of advanced robotic systems.I contributed to the "Artful Quality Control" project which showcased innovative techniques in advanced manufacturing. Our team's research has been recognised in leading publications such as IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.BackAreas of expertiseCollaborative RoboticsRobotic SimulationMachine Vision and SensingAI Enabled RoboticsEducationBEng (Hons), Mechatronics, University of Auckland, 2015Selected publicationshttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9687240https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309174020308421?via%3DihubArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
