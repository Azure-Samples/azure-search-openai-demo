Whether you’re an established entrepreneur, or new to running a business, your chosen incubator will provide all of the support needed to eventually get your solution to market.Successful applicants get a minimum of $1 million in funding — $750,000 of which is a repayable grant — to help cover costs associated with commercialising their technology.Don’t just publish your research, or shelve your idea - commercialise it, flourish and have a positive impact on our world.What is "Deep Tech"?Deep Tech refers to advanced technologies that are based on significant and defensible scientific or engineering advances rather than incremental refinement or delivery of standardized technologies.  These technologies often require extensive research and development, high levels of expertise, and significant investment. They have the potential to transform industries and create new products and services that were not possible before.By the numbers$28Mof public funding granted since 2020$60Mof private investment committed since 202035Deep tech ventures created since 2020Benefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2Keep on innovatingThe support to keep on driving forward with your vital scientific and technical work.Fill 1 Copy 2Specialist fundingA grant that understands the scale of the challenges you’re trying to overcome.Fill 1 Copy 2Find your long-term support systemJoin an incubator with all of the specialist skills and business know-how to bring your product to life.Fill 1 Copy 2Repayments based on revenueRepayments of the grant only begin if and when you start driving revenue, however long that may take.Is this right for me?EligibilityTo qualify for full funding and Incubator support, you need to prove that you:Have a Deep Tech, novel and defensible IP proposal with significant scientific or technical advancement: there are many years of commercialisation ahead of you.Have a credible project plan, commercialisation plan and budget, and the Incubator must have allocated adequate resources to support the venture: you’ve plotted the future out with your partner Incubator.Are consistent with your chosen Incubator’s overall strategy and specialty area, or provide an acceptable rationale for any deviation from strategy: you’re with the right partner.Best suited toThere’s four things we’re looking for in a venture:Early-stage with a long commercialisation path: you’re still fresh and have a long road ahead of you.High-growth with global ambition: your innovation could be very successful and have a broad, positive impact around the world.Strong science or engineering links, with some technical validation to date.Ventures incorporated in New Zealand, that benefit New Zealand: you’re here in Aotearoa and your innovation will help your fellow Kiwis.Funding availableAs well as providing the right support to grow your venture, we want to ensure that a lack of funding isn’t blocking the route to future success.All successful applicants will have a minimum of $1,000,000 to start their commercialisation journey:A minimum of $250,000 privately funded - from the Incubator you’ve partnered with.$750,000 publicly funded - coming from Callaghan Innovation in the form of a repayable grant.You’ll only start making repayments - 3% of annual revenue - when your venture starts earning revenue, however long that may take.To qualify for full funding and Incubator support, you need to prove that you:Have a Deep Tech, novel and defensible IP proposal with significant scientific or technical advancement: there are many years of commercialisation ahead of you.Have a credible project plan, commercialisation plan and budget, and the Incubator must have allocated adequate resources to support the venture: you’ve plotted the future out with your partner Incubator.Are consistent with your chosen Incubator’s overall strategy and specialty area, or provide an acceptable rationale for any deviation from strategy: you’re with the right partner.There’s four things we’re looking for in a venture:Early-stage with a long commercialisation path: you’re still fresh and have a long road ahead of you.High-growth with global ambition: your innovation could be very successful and have a broad, positive impact around the world.Strong science or engineering links, with some technical validation to date.Ventures incorporated in New Zealand, that benefit New Zealand: you’re here in Aotearoa and your innovation will help your fellow Kiwis.As well as providing the right support to grow your venture, we want to ensure that a lack of funding isn’t blocking the route to future success.All successful applicants will have a minimum of $1,000,000 to start their commercialisation journey:A minimum of $250,000 privately funded - from the Incubator you’ve partnered with.$750,000 publicly funded - coming from Callaghan Innovation in the form of a repayable grant.You’ll only start making repayments - 3% of annual revenue - when your venture starts earning revenue, however long that may take."Callaghan Innovation and WNT Ventures started supporting us long before we had all the answers to bring Hairspace to life. Through the Deep Tech Incubator program, they have provided vital investment and business support to get us to where we are today. There’s more work ahead, but we know we have the experience and support of some exceptional people to keep us moving forward."Michael WoffindinCEO Hairspace"We’re building complicated technology, for which we think there’s enormous potential, but it costs money to get that going. WNT Ventures and Callaghan Innovation are enabling us to get this off the ground; without that support CarbonCrop wouldn’t exist, and landowners wouldn’t be creating the forest."Nick ButcherCEO, CarbonCrop"There are very few companies exploring lncRNA for oncology purposes so the process of getting the research to market is complex but the support the programme provides is crucial. It enables us to access a supportive network of like-minded people to help us as we create what has the potential to be a ground-breaking cancer therapy."Dr Sarah DiermeierFounder, Amaroq TherapeuticsWhat’s involvedFill 1 Copy 2Step 1First, get in touch for an initial chat and we can help gauge if the Deep Tech Incubator programme is the right fit for you.Fill 1 Copy 2Step 2Choose the Incubator that’s best suited (see below) and we’ll introduce you.

This programme is as much about helping early-stage ventures to find the right support and partners as it is about granting money.
