People very much sit at the heart of our organisation and guide all that we do. Our values are:Be humble: We believe in keeping our feet on the ground and our head out of the clouds. Success is shared, and we’d rather see you in the spotlight than we would ourselves.Be practical: We believe in rolling up our sleeves, getting our hands dirty, and walking the talk. Actions speak louder than words and visible results always trump words on a page.Be dependable: We always do what we say and stand by our word. We hold ourselves and each other accountable and can always be relied on to deliver.Lean Service Delivery Methodologies We believe a business must always stay focused on the value they bring to their customers. When this perspective is ignored, staff soon forget why the business even exists, creating uncertainty and a general lack of engagement. Each team member needs to understand how they fit in the process of delivering value to customers so they can tie their daily tasks directly to high-impact results.To that end, our team will work with you to deploy a customised suite of precise and proven Lean methodologies and tools to seek out the key leverage points for your business.You’ll benefit from our team’s 20-plus years of experience in successfully executing Lean projects all over the world.Our proven process: Initial project scoping Company benchmarking (pre-project) Lean Hub Development of: Project charterCompany vision (leadership team)Company values (all staff)Formation/refreshment of roles and responsibilities and leadership deliverables Competitive systems and practices national qualification offered to all staff Establishing metrics (KPIs/ dashboard) Introduction of 5S (techniques to become better organised) Problem solving and root cause analysis Use of various Lean tools as required (SMED, OEE, PDCAs) Company benchmarking (post-project) Next steps after year-one implementationBackContactshttps://theleanhub.co.nz/Steffan Kellyinfo@theleanhub.co.nz027 696 8516Areas of experienceLean project implementationSystem and process improvements Sustainable growth planning Waste-reduction planning Digital enablement and technology coaching Industry 4.0 guidance and implementation Visual management using technology to display real-time production results Culture improvement and increased staff engagementQuality management Governance and strategic planning Leadership coachingSector experienceFood manufacturing and processingGeneral manufacturingForestry/LoggingFisheries and seafood processing and exporting facilities Engineering Farming (livestock and cropping)Service/RetailSector expertiseWorking with us onLean CoachingPricingRates range from $1,600–$2,800 per day, depending on project requirements.Related ProductsPrevNext1 / 1Lean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
