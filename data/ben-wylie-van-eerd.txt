An intriguing aspect of my work involves exploring the diverse applications of ultrasound beyond pregnancy scans. Ultrasound has proven invaluable in imaging organs like hearts and livers, as well as examining structural concrete and transmission lines. Currently, we are actively researching developments using ultrasound not only for imaging but also for treating disease and medical conditions. I draw inspiration from Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist known for his exceptional ability to simplify complex scientific concepts and make them accessible to everyone. His dedication to teaching and explaining intricate theories in a relatable manner is something I work hard to emulate in my own work.Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of contributing to groundbreaking innovations. Notably, I am the inventor of the adaptive optic system, a vital component in modern extreme-ultraviolet lithography systems. This technology has significantly advanced the field of lithography, enabling the production of intricate and high-resolution microstructures.BackAreas of expertiseUltrasound transducersFinite element modellingPiezoelectric materialsAcoustic particle manipulationRaman spectroscopyThin film growth (pulsed laser deposition)Clean room proceduresLaser microscopyEducationPhD in Physics, Victoria University of Wellington 2013Selected publicationsControlling Piezoelectric Responses in Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 Films through Deposition Conditions and Nanosheet Buffer Layers on Glass.
