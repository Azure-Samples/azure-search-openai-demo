My projects span vision systems and language processing for custom-design systems. These capability research projects are one step on the journey to commercialising technologies for Callaghan Innovation’s customers. Although I sometimes describe myself as a jack-of-all-trades, I am also the master of some. These include computer and machine vision, AI and robotics.I was trained as a Mechatronics Engineer, which is a blend of Mechanical, Electronics, Computer and Software Engineering, and focused on Computer Vision during my PhD studies. An example project was developing image registration algorithms to automate the process of scanning images of Maori artefacts for the purpose of 3D reconstruction. In a recent project for Stylefit we developed a natural language processing model for school-aged children which analyses a piece of writing such as a story or report and provides feedback on the style of writing and how to improve it.Working with food manufacturer Pic’s Peanut Butter, we developed a contamination detection system using a machine learning algorithm to detect unwanted objects such as stones, glass or plastic in their product. These were detected with up to 95% accuracy.  BackAreas of expertiseComputer and machine visionAI, machine learning, deep learning, neural networksRoboticsControl systemsProgramming: C/C++,  Python, MATLAB,EducationBE (Mechatronics), University of Auckland, 2005BA (Statistics, Japanese),  University of Auckland, 2005PhD (Mechatronics Engineering),  University of Auckland, 2009ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
