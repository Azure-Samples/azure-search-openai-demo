They’ll work closely with you to identify and test the processes required to scale up your innovative product, as well as highlighting new technologies and machinery that could help take your idea to the next level. Plus, each of the hubs runs a number of courses and workshops each year, helping elevate the knowledge in your fledgling business.Working alongside the processing facilities are NZFIN’s Business Development Managers, who are on hand to guide you toward the most useful facilities, both within the NZFIN and wider food and beverage production industry, as well as offering advice and bespoke consultancy services.If you’ve cooked up something brand new, innovative and delicious, the New Zealand Food Innovation Network is here to help you get it onto the dining tables of millions.By the numbers250+Businesses use the services of NZFIN each yearBenefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2Scale up manufactureWork with experts to establish the processes that will scale up your manufacturing for the mass market.Fill 1 Copy 2Innovate furtherLearn about the large-scale technology available that can help you create even more innovative products.Fill 1 Copy 2Trusted and confidentialTrusted teams that will provide the support and guidance needed, whilst protecting your IP.Fill 1 Copy 2Ready to eat prototypesLeave with Food Safe prototypes, ready for market testing with your target customers.Is this right for me?Best suited toThe New Zealand Food Innovation Network, and its facilities, were initially founded to drive forward food innovation and support businesses that are developing new and exciting products.The businesses that we see getting the most from the NZFIN generally have a concept or idea that’s never been seen on supermarket shelves before and are in the early stages of development.
