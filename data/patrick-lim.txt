I specialise in the application of these technologies for the processing of natural products with inherent high variability. My 30 years of applied research experience is a track record of leading edge innovations through technology development, implementation and adoption in agriculture and horticulture industries.My inspiration is Thomas Edison who, although well known for inventing the electric light bulb, actually failed 2774 times before he came up with a working design. His tenacity inspires me to push on and get through the difficult times in the journey of technical discovery.I was science co-leader of the Ovine Automation Research Programme which was awarded the KiwiNet Commercialisation Collaboration Team award. It was established to transform the ovine processing industry. With $15.6m funding over 6 years, novel robotic technology was developed for the automation of high speed production operations with the aim to increase productivity, cost savings, hygiene and quality. In collaboration with a manufacturer, these products are moving towards commercialisation and adoption. BackAreas of expertiseAdvanced roboticsIndustrial automationProject managementProof of concept prototypingTechnology transferImpact / technical advisorR&D roadmappingEducationMEng, Advanced Control, University of Auckland, 1995BEng (Hons), Electrical & Electronics, University of Auckland, 1992Memberships and awardsIEEE Senior MemberNZ Robotics, Automation and Sensing (NZRAS) memberKiwiNet Commercialisation Collaboration Team Award, 2013Royal Society Medal Team Award, 1998Selected publicationsNon-invasive spectroscopic and imaging systems for prediction of beef quality in a meat processing pilot plant, Y.
