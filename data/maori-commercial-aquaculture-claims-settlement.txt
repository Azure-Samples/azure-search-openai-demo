settlementWe are responsible for delivering the Crown's Māori commercial aquaculture settlement obligations.Delivering the settlementThe Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004 (Settlement Act) provides for the full and final settlement of Māori commercial aquaculture claims since 21 September 1992. The Settlement Act requires the Crown to provide settlement assets to Te Ohu Kaimoana Trustee Limited (the Trustee) for distribution to Iwi Aquaculture Organisations (which are defined in section 33 of the Settlement Act).Assets provided under this settlement must be equivalent to 20% of aquaculture space. The settlement has been delivered in 3 parts:The pre-commencement space settlement related to marine farming space applied for between 21 September 1992 and 31 December 2004, and involved the Crown paying cash settlement for growth that had occurred before the Settlement was decided.Under an interim settlement phase from 2004 to 2011, iwi received a share of new aquaculture space within "aquaculture management areas" established by councils.Under the current "new space" settlement regime, the Crown must provide iwi with settlement assets equivalent to 20% of the value of all new marine farming space created after 1 October 2011. This phase requires the Crown to deliver assets on an ongoing basis, ahead of growth occurring. It uses a forecast of anticipated growth so that iwi receive assets up front as a more usable package, rather than incrementally as growth occurs over time.Regional agreementsThe Crown's settlement obligations are settled by region, based on regional council and unitary authority boundaries.Settlements are usually made under regional agreements between the Iwi Aquaculture Organisations that represent a region, the Crown and the Trustee. Regional agreements can deliver assets in a number of forms, including as authorisations to apply to use aquaculture space, the cash equivalent value of that space, or as another benefit agreed between the Crown, iwi and Trustee.Settlement assets can also be delivered through default provisions in the Settlement Act if a regional agreement cannot be reached. In this case, the assets are transferred to the Trustee without requiring iwi to reach a regional agreement.The Māori Commercial Aquaculture Settlement New Space PlanThe Settlement Act requires the Crown to prepare a plan in consultation with the Trustee and iwi that sets out how the Crown will deliver the aquaculture settlement. This "new space plan" sets out a forecast of where aquaculture growth is expected to happen up to 2035, and a methodology for valuing that space, to identify the Crown's settlement obligations to iwi in a particular region. Māori Commercial Aquaculture Settlement New Space Plan 2014  [PDF, 944 KB]The Settlement Act requires that the new space plan is periodically reviewed, and a review is underway. We will engage iwi aquaculture organisations and recognised iwi organisations on the draft review and implementation of the recommendations, before publishing an updated new space plan. To assist with this review, we commissioned an independent evaluation of the new space regime. Information about that evaluation follows.Independent evaluation of the new space regimeIn 2019 the Government’s Aquaculture Strategy committed to an independent evaluation of the benefits of the aquaculture settlement. This independent evaluation was undertaken assess whether improved mechanisms could better advance Crown and iwi aspirations. It was undertaken in 2020.The overarching objectives for the independent evaluation were:ascertain Crown and iwi intent and aspirations for the aquaculture settlementidentify the implementation outputs achieved to dateassess whether those outputs are aligned with the outcomes and aspirationsidentify the benefits and shortcomings of current mechanisms and outputsconsider whether improved mechanisms and outputs could better advance Crown and iwi outcomes and aspirations, taking into account expected new space aquaculture developments (including those in the Aquaculture Strategy)suggest recommendations for improvements to:advance Crown and iwi outcomes and aspirationsimprove outputsmaximise benefitsovercome barriers for future successful delivery of the new space settlement mechanisms.The recommendations align well with Fisheries New Zealand's and Te Ohu Kaimoana's thinking and will be addressed through the review of the new space plan.

An Agreement in Principle was signed on Monday 13 October 2008 by Ministers and iwi representatives at Parliament.The Deed was signed by Ministers and iwi representatives on 6 May 2009 at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Marae. It allowed for a one-off cash payment of $97 million in full and final settlement of the Crown's obligations for pre-commencement space granted after 21 September 1992 in the regions named.

This space (two offshore marine farms) was settled under the Deed, however, it was settled after completion of the Deed under provisions in the Deed that provided for “further payments” to be made.New space processToggle expandableNew space processNew space is space that is subject to the consent process under section 116A of the Resource Management Act 1991 in terms of aquaculture activities in the coastal marine area from 1 October 2011 onwards. It can be space that is actually consented after 1 October 2011 or space that is anticipated or forecast to be used for aquaculture activities in the future.The Crown must use its best endeavours to negotiate and enter into regional agreements to settle these new space obligations. The Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act sets out the statutory timeframes within which those regional agreements must be entered into – although these timeframes can be extended by the Minister.The Minister for Primary Industries’ New Space Plan is the framework for how the Crown will deliver on the settlement of new space under the Act.Notifying aquaculture space through Gazette noticesUnder the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act, powers have been given to the Minister to gazette space in the coastal marine area to create future settlement options.This power is being used to notify space for settlement purposes, mitigating the risk that private interests have first access to better aquaculture space while regional agreements are being negotiated.Purpose of Gazette noticesNotifying space under Gazette notices does not change current uses or rules. But it stops private interests from applying for resource consents to carry out aquaculture activities. It also prevents regional authorities from consenting other activities that might affect future aquaculture activities.All gazetted space is still subject to the resource consents process and any other regulatory requirements before it can be approved for aquaculture. Community participation is a core component of Resource Management Act 1991 processes.Gazette notices are not a replacement for negotiated regional settlements.Gazette notices issuedGazette notices have been issued for aquaculture settlement purposes for areas in:Northland, Waikato (east), and Marlborough where aquaculture development is expected (Gazette notice issued 29 September 2011)The Marlborough Sounds (10 May 2012)Akaroa Harbour (18 October 2012).The notices can be in read in the New Zealand Gazette on the Department of Internal Affairs website:29 September 2011 notices – refer to page 4211  [PDF, 442KB]10 May 2012 notices – refer to page 1459  [PDF 331KB]18 October 2012 – refer to page 3664  [PDF, 621KB]These Aquaculture Settlement Areas have been gazetted to allow the government to enter into meaningful negotiations with iwi. However, gazetting space doesn't confer any other rights or certainty the space will later become part of a regional agreement under the settlement.RegionSiteAreaDate NotifiedNorthlandTe Ngaire Bay10 ha29 September 2011NorthlandAhipara10 ha29 September 2011NorthlandHokianga Harbour12.5 ha29 September 2011NorthlandHerekino Harbour12.5 ha29 September 2011Waikato (east)Coromandel Marine Farm Zone60 ha29 September 2011Waikato (east)Coromandel Harbour10 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughPort Gore - South23 ha (initially notified for 7.5 ha)29 September 2011 and  extended 10 May 2012MarlboroughPort Underwood - Entrance20 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughCrosilles Harbour - Upper2 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughCrosilles Harbour - Oyster Bay3 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughTory Channel - Oyster Bay3 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughPort Underwood - Upper2 ha29 September 2011MarlboroughTawero Point North8 ha10 May 2012MarlboroughTawero Point South20 ha10 May 2012CanterburyLucas Bay20 ha18 October 2012ResourcesThese are background documents about the Māori commercial aquaculture claims settlement process.
