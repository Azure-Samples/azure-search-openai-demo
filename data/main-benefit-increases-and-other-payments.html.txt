if your main benefit goes upWhen your main benefit increases, this may affect some of your other payments like Temporary Additional Support or Accommodation Supplement. It may also change the amount you need to pay for public housing or emergency housing.Everyone’s situation is different so your payments could increase, decrease or stay the same. It will depend on things like your overall income, the type of payments you get, where you live and your other circumstances.This page gives general information on how your other payments may change when your main benefit increases.You can check your exact payments in MyMSD closer to the date your benefit increases.Temporary Additional Support and Special BenefitWhen your benefit goes up, your Temporary Additional Support or Special Benefit payments may then go down.This is because Temporary Additional Support or Special Benefit helps with the gap between your income and your essential living costs. If your income increases, the extra amount needed to meet your essential costs will be less.Not everyone will see a difference in their Temporary Additional Support or Special Benefit – it will depend on your individual situation, costs and overall income.Childcare AssistanceWhen your benefit goes up, it may reduce your Childcare Assistance if your overall income rises over a certain threshold.That’s because the amount of Childcare Assistance you get depends on your income, including your benefit, wages, Child Support or other payments from the child’s other parent.Not everyone will see a difference in their Childcare Assistance when benefit rates increase – it will depend on your overall income.OSCAR Subsidy income thresholds and ratesChildcare Subsidy income thresholds and ratesNote that from 1 July 2021, we won’t consider payments such as Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support and Disability Allowance as income when we’re assessing how much Childcare Assistance you can get.Accommodation SupplementIf your overall income rises over a certain threshold when your benefit goes up, it may reduce your Accommodation Supplement – but it will depend on your individual situation.That’s because how much Accommodation Supplement you get depends on several things including:your incomeyour assetsyour accommodation costsyour family circumstanceswhere you live. Rent for public housingIf you live in public housing and your benefit or other income goes up, the rent you pay may also increase – but not right away.That’s because the rent you pay in public housing is based on your income and the income of your partner or other signed tenants (if any). Your income-related rent is usually no more than 25% of your income.For example: if your income is $320 a week, your income-related rent may be $80 a week. If your income went up to $340 a week, your rent could go up to $85 a week.Any change will happen after we next review your income-related rent and let your landlord know about it. Your landlord will be in touch with you to confirm the new amount and the date your rent will change.Emergency housing contributionIf your benefit or other income goes up, your emergency housing contribution will also increase the next time you apply for an Special Needs Grant for emergency housing,That’s because you need to pay 25% of your weekly income towards your accommodation costs when you stay in emergency housing for more than 7 nights.For example: if your weekly income is $400, your emergency housing contribution would be $100 each week. If your income went up to $440 a week, your emergency housing contribution would go up to $110 a week.Disability AllowanceYour Disability Allowance will not be affected by the Annual General Adjustment changes.Child Disability AllowanceYour Child Disability Allowance will not be affected by the Annual General Adjustment changes.RelatedChanges to benefit rates from 1 April 2024Benefit ratesHow we can helpBenefits and paymentsWorkOn a benefitHousingOnline servicesCheck what you might getFind workApply onlineMyMSDHow to stay safe onlineAboutAbout Work and IncomeAbout this siteAccessibilityPrivacy, disclaimer and copyrightContact usPhone numbers                    Find a service centre                    Facebook                    Twitter                    Feedback                              Help in other languages        Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa /
