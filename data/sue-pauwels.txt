They are R&D intensive yet often lack an understanding of what it takes to bring a product to the global market.For over 20 years I have worked in the New Zealand science system assisting companies develop new products. A key aspect of my work is to develop sound pathways for both technical and market validation while also providing an understanding of the complex regulatory frameworks necessary for global success.New Zealand clinicians and founders continue to inspire me. Their dedication to better the lives of their patients by developing new, novel and smart devices help patients get well again. During my work I was at the start of a journey with two 20-year old entrepreneurs whose vision was to build a revision tool for High School students. After 8 years working together the company grew to be valued at over $50M and is now valued at over $350m.BackAreas of expertiseHealthTech Medical DevicesDigital SectorAgritech, AquacultureI have an interest in Construction SectorHTA suite of products and workshops including, Capital Education,Regulatory Pathways, Clinical Validation, Know your Customer/Know your ProductBeyond IPProduct market fit/ tech validationEvent facilitation Product 360EducationNursing qualification. MBA from Massey ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
