Within the Executive Leadership Team, I lead a dynamic function responsible for driving the operational excellence that underpins our strategic vision. My responsibilities span critical areas such as Digital (including Data, Architecture, and Cybersecurity), Health and Safety, Risk and Audit, Sustainability, People and Culture, Business Support and Legal.I believe that our enablement efforts ensure our operational gears run seamlessly, allowing our customer-facing teams to excel. Witnessing how Callaghan Innovation contributes to shaping the trajectories of early-stage ventures is deeply gratifying along with the knowledge that some will go on to make a positive impact on the lives of New Zealanders.My work here gives me the opportunity to share my experiences and empower capable individuals to embrace their potential. I get fulfilment by guiding them to discover their strength to achieve great feats for the first time. Being a female role model in tech is another aspect I cherish, having led the launch of eBay in the UK and transforming it into Europe's largest e-commerce platform in just under two years. My career, including two start-ups and diverse tech industry exposure, allows me to genuinely connect as a role model.After a tenure at Amazon that involved selling a fair amount of plastic, my desire to give back to society has found a home at Callaghan Innovation. I relish our role in fostering innovation in New Zealand, a mission that can be challenging in a smaller ecosystem.BackAreas of expertiseDigital - Data, Architecture and CybersecurityHealth and SafetyRisk and AuditSustainabilityPeople and CultureLegalCustomer outcomesFinance PerspectiveEQEducationBachelor of Commerce, Auckland University, 1991MBA, International Institute for Management Development (IMD), 2002TOGAF9 (Enterprise tech and business architecture), 2020Memberships and awardsRan a marathon when I was 13 and won a prize for that…!ArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
