Shortlisted finalists have now been notified.The Ārohia Evidence Grant remains open.Getting that ground-breaking idea out of the lab or workshop and successfully into the hands of customers is hard work. We know even the brightest innovators struggle with this challenging step.The  Ārohia Trailblazer Grant was created to support the very best innovative businesses at the “getting ready to go to market” stage of their innovation’s journey. They’ve done most of the tricky research and development for their game-changing creation, but they need that critical funding to finally bring their new product or service to market.The grant actively seeks projects that are the best of the best of those at this stage and is specifically looking to support those businesses with four clear attributes (below), and the ability to demonstrate them. Unlike other grants, you’re competing against other businesses and innovators, with only the very best receiving funding.Most important of the four attributes is how these game-changers approach creating opportunities for the other innovators around them, as well as the wider innovation ecosystem in Aotearoa. We know one ingenious creation today can spillover to create many, many more for the future.So, if you’re doing something ground-breaking, need a helping hand to get to market, and your work is a positive force for other innovators, get in touch.If you’re the best of the best, you could become an Ārohia Trailblazer.By the numbers10maximum finalists per round$4mmaximum co-funding$21.4mgranted to date$15.1mavailable in the next round"We are very appreciative of Callaghan Innovation’s support through the Ārohia Trailblazer Grant to help us commercialise our technology, moving from pilot plant technical data to an engineering package that our customer can use to build a large industrial chemical manufacturing plant, using waste as a feedstock."Mike OliverCEO, Avertana"We are thrilled to be recognised as an Ārohia Innovation Trailblazer.

Diagnosis often takes a number of years, prolonging patient suffering and resulting in wasted resources and inefficiencies in the healthcare system. With the help of the Ārohia Trailblazer Innovation Grant, Alimetry Care, the organisation’s latest device and service, is set to become the world’s first accurate monitoring wearable for home use, providing remote care for people suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms.

Avertana’s proprietary technology refines industrial waste streams from steelmaking into valuable mineral and chemical products with less cost and CO2 emissions, using innovative chemistry and novel process design. With the help of the Ārohia Trailblazer Innovation Grant, Avertana is working to create more sustainable, resilient supply chains by lowering the cost and environmental impact of essential raw materials used to make everyday products.

However, as market demand for lithium-ion batteries skyrockets driven by the electrification economy, so too does the environmental cost. Ārohia Trailblazer Grant recipient’s CarbonScape are the first company in the world to pioneer technology for creating sustainable, carbon negative biographite for the battery sector, using renewable forestry waste such as woodchips.

Dawn Aerospace, recipients of the Ārohia Innovation Trailblazer grant, wants to enable the next generation of space users by providing more sustainable and scalable ways to access and move around in orbit. They believe this access, in the form of their transportation network, will fundamentally change what’s possible from space.

Ārohia Trailblazer Neocrete are using Roman innovation and nanotechnology to replace cement in concrete with activated volcanic ash, with no loss in workability or strength.
