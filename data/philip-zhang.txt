We’re helping companies using my applied maths skills in the areas of Machine Learning and Finite Element Modelling, and have developed several cutting-edge models in Image Processing and Natural Language Processing.Working for the compliance and risk management SaaS business Totum, I managed the project, and our team delivered a DIY workshop upskilling their software developers with cutting-edge models in NLP. Their team was really satisfied with our team’s services and gave us a perfect score (10/10) on our overall performance in the post-workshop survey conducted by Callaghan Innovation.When developing and building models you may not know that in the 'eyes' of Language Models, all ideas are literally ‘equal’: they are just some vectors in a Latent Vector Space.BackAreas of expertiseNatural Language ProcessingComputer Image ProcessingFinite Element ModellingEducationPhD in Applied Mathematics, Massey University, 2008Memberships and awardsOne of the key members of the Data Vision team as we won the Team Award in Science New Zealand 2020.Selected publicationsW.
