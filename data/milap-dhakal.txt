My past experience includes research into alternative cementing materials such as MgO-SiO2 cements and geopolymers. And I also maintain research interests around the structural application of concrete-based materials and sustainability in construction materials.Working with Callaghan Innovation customers, I led the development of a clay-based MgO and Geopolymer cement system. This was developed to produce concrete mixes for structurally sound concrete elements. You may not know that concrete, the second-most used construction commodity after water, is the cleanest construction material in market. Cement scientists like me are working hard to reduce its associated carbon footprint. I enjoy working through seemingly challenging problems and finding ways to make things work with simpler and cheaper processes. That’s applied technology in action.BackAreas of expertiseCement formulationFresh properties of cement and concreteMicro-structuresPerformance-based concrete design optimizationMaterial testingConcrete durability indicesStructural analysis of RC elementsDesigned experimentsConcrete 3D printingEducationPhD.
