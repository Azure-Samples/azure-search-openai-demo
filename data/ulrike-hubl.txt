Since then I have become an integral part of Integrated Biotechnologies, which has now evolved into the Biotechnology group at Callaghan Innovation and continue to work as a Senior Research Scientist in the area of Protein Biochemistry.Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working alongside remarkable individuals; one person who stands out for me is Soerge Kelm. During my PhD, I had the privilege of collaborating with him and was consistently amazed by his ability to bridge different aspects of glycobiology. His profound knowledge and its application in research continue to inspire me.One of my proudest accomplishments was implementing an effective method for analysing multiple whey proteins in a single chromatographic step. This achievement contributed significantly to the biochemistry and purification of milk proteins. A crucial insight from my research is the profound impact that even the smallest variation in carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces can have on your health and disease susceptibility.What invigorates me each day is the possibility of discovering something new and establishing connections between different systems.BackAreas of expertiseProtein biochemistry, characterization and purificationEnzyme technologyBiotransformationOligosaccharide analysisPolysaccharide analysisGlycoproteins and glycopeptidesGlycoconjugatesGlycolipidsELISAHPLC/UPLCEducationDiploma in Chemistry (equivalent to Masters), Christian Albrechts University in Kiel, 1992Doctorate in Natural Sciences (Biochemistry), Christian Albrechts University in Kiel 1996Selected publications'Comparison of conditions for the hydrolytic release of N-acetylneuraminic acid from bovine glycomacropeptide.'
