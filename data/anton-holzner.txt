My customers leverage my skills to discover new people, programmes and resources which will help them make progress.Day to day my work includes talking about innovations, business roadblock issues and the aspirations of young inventors and mature businesses. These inspire me because many of these projects and innovations will have an impact on the coming generations who will witness change to a greater extent than we can. Many sustainable businesses plant the seeds of growth now in order to make a change in the future.A self-professed “total tree hugger”, I recommend you use a keep cup for coffee when you're meeting me. I often volunteer in telling people how to reuse or recycle correctly, and I love it when you ask me about my dog, Archie.Smart people who use their brain power for a purpose that’s bigger than the quick dollar are a strong motivator for me. Projects which have the potential to impact future generations in Aotearoa like green energy, waste reduction and recycling, native tree forestation and wildlife protection make me feel positive about the future.BackAreas of expertisemarketingbrandingecommercepassion for sustainable conceptsagilescrumbusiness efficiencycommercialisationEducationGerman post graduate diploma in Strategic Branding [University, year of graduation MISSINGSCRUM masterBusiness Coach and TrainerArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
