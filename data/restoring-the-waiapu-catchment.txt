reviewed: 16.11.20Restoring the Waiapu CatchmentRestoring the Waiapu River catchment in the Gisborne district is a collaborative programme between MPI, Te Runanganui O Ngāti Porou (TRONPnui), and the Gisborne District Council (GDC). The programme aims to treat erosion, stop greater physical damage to the catchment, and bring social and economic gains to iwi and landowners.Action plan to kick off 100-year programmeRestoring the Waiapu River catchment will take time and the effects of erosion will take decades to remediate. The timeframe for this programme is 100 years, evolving over 4 phases with an initial focus on the first 10 years.To get started, the programme partners developed an 11-month action plan, which began in October 2013, to:draw together the expertise and information within GDC, MPI, and TRONPNuiaccelerate land remediation by targeting the priority blocks causing the greatest damage to the catchmentremove barriers to East Coast Forestry Project (ECFP) grantsassist owners of land in Māori title with land use, planning and management, and accessing financepresent landowners with a wider range of treatment and land-use optionsencourage sustainable land-use practices and build innovative and profitable businesses.Find out more about the ECFPProgramme visionKo te mana ko te hauora o te whenua, ko te hauora o ngā awa, ko te hauora o te iwi– Healthy land, healthy rivers, healthy people.Programme will support the local economy and societyThe Waiapu catchment has the highest suspended sediment yield of any river in New Zealand and one of the highest in the world.If erosion remains untreated in key areas, models suggest there is the potential for current erosion and sedimentation to double by 2050. The catchment would experience even greater physical damage, the area's agricultural production would decline, and social deprivation would worsen.The desired outcomes of restoring the catchment are:environmental restorationeconomic profitabilitycultural revitalisationsocial prosperity.While the programme focuses on the Waiapu catchment, it also provides the impetus to improve the ECFP and GDC's Sustainable Hill Country Programme across the district, for the benefit of all the district's iwi and landowners.Memorandum of understanding signedThe Waiapu catchment restoration programme partners – MPI, TRONPNui, and the GDC – have signed a memorandum of understanding, committing to 100 years of working collaboratively with landowners to improve the health of the Waiapu River catchment.Find out more Memorandum of Understanding  [PDF, 3.5 MB] Restoring the Waiapu Catchment brochure  [PDF, 1.1 MB] Waiapu River Catchment Study Report – Executive Summary  [PDF, 164 KB] Final Report for the 2012 Waiapu Catchment Study  [PDF, 5 MB] Review of MAF Afforestation Schemes: Permanent Forest Sink Initiative, Afforestation Grant Scheme, East Coast Forestry Project, Sustainable Land Management (Hill Country Erosion) Programme  [PDF, 400 KB]Read about the Sustainable Hill Country Project on the GDC website Visit the TRONPNui website  Climate Change and Community Resilience in the Waiapu Catchment  [PDF, 2 MB]FeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
