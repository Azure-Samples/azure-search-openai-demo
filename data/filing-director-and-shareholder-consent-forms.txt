Signing consent formsDirectorsEach director must sign a consent form and, in doing so, certify they aren't disqualified from being appointed or holding office.Sometimes we might request additional information to confirm the identity or personal information of a proposed director.ShareholdersShareholder consent forms should be signed by the shareholder themselves. In some circumstances, an agent or solicitor may need to sign a form on a shareholder's behalf.If a shareholder holds shares in more than 1 share allocation they may need to sign multiple consent forms. The shareholder must sign and return each consent form they receive.Sometimes we request additional information to confirm the identity or personal information of a proposed shareholder. Where the shareholder is a company with an overseas address, we may request additional proof of identity from a director or other senior representative of the company.Where an agent is signingAn agent must provide written confirmation of their authorisation to sign on behalf of a shareholder.A copy of that authorisation must be submitted along with the consent form. The following example shows the authorisation wording we generally consider acceptable.
