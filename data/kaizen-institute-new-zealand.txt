The New Zealand business unit was registered in 1988 when Masaaki Imai and Taiichi Ohno (the mastermind behind the Toyota Production System) visited Fisher & Paykel. During June 2021 Masaaki Imai published his third book on KAIZEN™ at the age of 90! Sensei Imai peacefully passed away during June 2023 at the age of 92, leaving a profound legacy for our consultants and clients in more than 60 countries.Kaizen Institute New Zealand collaborates globally with more than 500 KAIZEN™ consultants, continuously improving our own products, processes, people, and purpose to benefit our clients. Our team is involved in developing and reviewing the global KAIZEN™ methodology, which we implement in your workplace based on your unique requirements. We don’t ‘copy and paste’ Lean tools; we offer comprehensive consulting and coaching to support you to transform yourself to achieve a true and lasting KAIZEN™ culture where work becomes easier for everyone, everywhere, every day (in Mr Imai’s words). We regard respect for people as a critical foundation for business excellence and practise it ourselves when working with you. Our team has decades of experience in applying KAIZEN™ and through owning our own businesses.Lean Service Delivery Methodologies We first determine your business’ needs with owners, senior leaders, and/or key influencers in your team using the proven KAIZEN™ methods and tools. A system to manage the programme and the deliverables is set up with your senior leadership team. Training and coaching of KAIZEN™ leaders at all levels enables the culture of excellence that will sustain your ongoing improvements. Frontline staff are engaged in the application of the relevant KAIZEN™ tools to ensure new, improved behaviours are embedded at all levels.Value Stream Analysis is done during planning workshops, leading to strategy improvements through prioritised breakthrough projects (also in job-shops), targeting improvements in people (motivation),and processes (quality, lead times, and cost). Waste in the business is identified and systematically reduced through the application of KAIZEN™ methods, tools, and techniques. Data-driven decision-making (quantitative) is incorporated in the KAIZEN™ methodology. It is also a qualitative approach (focusing on analysing and establishing behaviours, attitudes, and mindsets).BackContactshttps://kaizen.com/Peet Wiidpwiid@kaizen.com021 897 832Areas of experienceHolistic KAIZEN™ improvement: product, process, people, purpose (strategy)Culture transformation through changing thinking and behaviouralKAIZEN™ leadership development to sustain LeanKAIZEN™ principles implementation to underpin Lean methodsEnabling any type of organisation to implement the KAIZEN™ methodology, tools, and techniquesFrontline staff engagement and developmentPractical implementation with your teams.Sector experienceConstructionFood processingAgricultureRetailManufacturing: continuous processingManufacturing: job-shop environment EducationHealthcare (services and manufacturing) Logistics and warehousing.Sector expertiseWorking with us onLean CoachingPricingRates are $2,000 – $2,500 per full day, or $1,000 - $1,250 per half-day.Related ProductsPrevNext1 / 1Lean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
