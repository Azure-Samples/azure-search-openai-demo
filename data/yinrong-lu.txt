With over 15 years of experience, I have deep skill analysing diverse chemicals, ranging from small synthetic molecules to large natural proteins, using Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (QTof) instruments equipped with various ion sources (ESI, APCI, APPI).My background in natural product isolation and structural characterisation has equipped me to specialise in LCMS techniques for the analysis of targeted or untargeted metabolites in complex mixtures. I have successfully analysed degradation products of pharmaceuticals, lipids in various milks, and bioactives in fruits and plants.Hyphenated LCMS techniques include ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with QTof. These enable me to conduct a wide range of qualitative and quantitative applications. Tandem MS and mass accuracy further enhance my ability to confidently identify and characterise structures. My LCMS service is mainly devoted to making essential contributions to research teams’ scientific achievements within Callaghan Innovation, the Ferrier Research Institute of Victoria University, and BDG Synthesis. We also provide our LCMS service directly to clients such as Fonterra, Synlait, Daisylab and Douglas Pharmaceuticals. Through my work, I strive to uncover valuable insights and contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of mass spectrometry.BackAreas of expertiseHigh resolution Mass spectrometry of diverse chemicals from small synthetic molecules to large natural proteins (>15 years) on Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (QTof) instruments equipped with various ion sources (ESI, APCI, APPI). The hyphenated LCMS (ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with QTof) analyses, in particular, for a wide range of qualitative and quantitative applications .Tandem MS in addition to mass accuracy for confident structural identificationsStrong background in natural products isolation and structural characterisation.EducationPhD  Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Heidelberg University, Germany, 1989Dipl.
