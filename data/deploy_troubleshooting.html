<h1 id="rag-chat-troubleshooting-deployment">RAG chat: Troubleshooting
deployment</h1>
<p>If you are experiencing an error when deploying the RAG chat solution
using the <a href="../README.md#deploying">deployment steps</a>, this
guide will help you troubleshoot common issues.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You’re attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for
Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model
you’re trying to use isn’t enabled. See <a
href="https://aka.ms/oai/models">this matrix of model
availability</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per
region. See <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/quotas">this article on quotas
and limits</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re getting “same resource name not allowed” conflicts. That’s
likely because you’ve run the sample multiple times and deleted the
resources you’ve been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge
them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft
delete. See <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/manage-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource">this
article on purging resources</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You see <code>CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED</code> when the
<code>prepdocs.py</code> script runs. That’s typically due to incorrect
SSL certificates setup on your machine. Try the suggestions in this <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35569042/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-with-python3/43855394#43855394">StackOverflow
answer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>After running <code>azd up</code> and visiting the website, you
see a ‘404 Not Found’ in the browser. Wait 10 minutes and try again, as
it might be still starting up. Then try running <code>azd deploy</code>
and wait again. If you still encounter errors with the deployed app and
are deploying to App Service, consult the <a
href="/docs/appservice.md">guide on debugging App Service
deployments</a>. Please file an issue if the logs don’t help you resolve
the error.</p></li>
