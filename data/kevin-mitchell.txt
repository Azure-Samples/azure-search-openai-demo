My work revolves around utilising analytical techniques such as LCMS and SFCMS for the quantification, isolation, and structural elucidation of natural product compounds. This research is focused on industrial-scale process development and the exploration of secondary metabolites and lipids from plants.One of the best parts of my job is the ever-changing nature of my work. Each day brings new challenges and problems to solve, allowing me to constantly expand my knowledge, skills and expertise.I am currently developing advanced analytical supercritical chromatography capabilities within our team, specifically for chiral and achiral separations. This will enhance our ability to analyse and separate complex mixtures, opening up new opportunities for research and discovery.Natural products have a rich history since antiquity. Some of the earliest recorded natural products used for medical purposes? were oils from Cupressus sempervirens (Cypress) and Commiphora species (myrrh), as recorded in cuneiform scriptson ancient clay tablets originating in  Mesopotamia from around 2600 B.C.E. These natural products are still used today to treat coughs, colds and inflammation.Biotechnologies continue to advance and we contribute to developing many innovative solutions that our customers need. That’s both validating and motivating.BackAreas of expertiseNatural products isolation and characterisation.Bioassay guided fractionation and identification of bioactive natural products.Assay method development for quantification of natural product compounds and routine quantification services as required.General LCMS and SFCMS analyses including chiral chromatography separations.Lipidomics analysis by LCMS and SFCMS and use of statistical machine learning techniques for analysis of large datasets.Enzymatic glucuronidation and isolation of glucuronide conjugates of xenobiotics.EducationPhD, Botany, Victoria University, 2007MSc, Chemistry, University of Canterbury. 1993BSc (Hons.), Chemistry, University of Canterbury, 1992 Memberships and awardsMember NZICMember ANZSMSSelected publicationsAnti-gastrointestinal cancer activity of cyclodextrin-encapsulated propolis.
