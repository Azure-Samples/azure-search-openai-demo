           This message is to inform you that the Government has decided to close the in-year payment temporary loan scheme under the Research and Development Tax Incentive.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           There will be no further new loan requests under the temporary scheme. MBIE and TMNZ will continue to manage existing loans initiated under the temporary scheme, and the most recent round of loan requests (which closed on 15 January 2024) will continue to be processed and paid out to eligible businesses.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           We understand this decision will be disappointing to some businesses and we want to thank all businesses who engaged with the temporary in-year payment loan scheme. Please note, this decision only affects the in-year payments loan function of the Research and Development Tax Incentive.
          </span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           Businesses will still be able to access the Research and Development Tax Incentive. The set-up of a permanent in-year payment scheme will be determined in coming months and further announcements will be made.

               What are RDTI in-year payments?
              </h3>
              <div class="typography">
               <p>
                RDTI in-year payments offer you the option of an interest-free government loan that can provide regular cash payments towards your R&amp;D costs, starting in the same year as you conduct your R&amp;D.
               </p>
               <p>
                This will enable you to get support closer to when R&amp;D costs are incurred, rather than waiting for your RDTI tax credit to be issued (which can only happen after you’ve submitted your income tax return, and your RDTI Supplementary Return has been finalised by Inland Revenue).
               </p>
               <p>
                You can request up to 80% of the value of your expected tax credit for a particular income year.
               </p>
               <p>
                Generally, the loan won’t need to be repaid until after your RDTI Supplementary Return has been finalised.
               </p>

              <div class="typography">
               <p>
                Any business that has applied for the RDTI can apply for RDTI in-year payments. However, they are mainly designed for businesses that have no - or only partial - access to the other method of ‘in-year’ support offered by the RDTI.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you’re a profitable business, you already have the option of using up to 100% of your anticipated RDTI tax credit for a given income year, to offset your provisional tax payments for that year.
               </p>
               <p>
                This option isn’t available, or can’t be fully utilised, by the following businesses, who will benefit the most from RDTI in-year payments:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 businesses with no provisional tax to pay, such as start-ups and those operating at a loss
                </li>
                <li>
                 profitable businesses whose RDTI tax credit exceeds any provisional tax due
                </li>

                 It will only be necessary to apply for the loan once per income year, but you will be able to request payments at up to 3 regular intervals.

               <p>

               <p>

                 The loan will generally become due for repayment after your RDTI Supplementary Return has been finalised by Inland Revenue, although

              Benefit of using the anticipated RDTI tax credit to offset provisional tax
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Note that in example 2, the total benefit to the business is $41,000 (made up of the provisional tax offset of $25,000, plus the RDTI in-year payment of $16,000).
            </p>
            <p>
             This compares to a total benefit to the business of $36,000 in example 1.
            </p>
            <p>
             The difference reflects the benefit, if possible, of using the anticipated RDTI tax credit to offset provisional tax, given 100% of the credit can be offset this way, versus accessing 80% of the anticipated credit via RDTI in-year payments alone.

                 <ul>
                  <li>

                 <p>
                  This is because regardless of how you receive your RDTI tax credit, your RDTI in-year payments loan will become due for repayment on the applicable due date.

               Any RDTI tax credit that can’t be offset by tax due can be refunded in cash, up to a cap equal to the amount of labour-related taxes you pay, including:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                PAYE

                employee superannuation contribution taxes (ESCT).
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Any remaining tax credit will be carried forward to a future income year.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you are relying on a cash refund to repay an RDTI in-year payments loan, we suggest you calculate what your anticipated refund might be in advance. This may help you determine what is an affordable amount for you to borrow.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember, it will be your responsibility to ensure you are in a position to repay the loan.

                </p>
                <p>
                 This is because no RDTI tax credit can be issued if you miss the RDTI Supplementary Return deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                 RDTI Supplementary Returns are due within 30 days after the due date of your income tax return.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Filing your RDTI Supplementary Return on time will help avoid you being in a position where you have an RDTI in-year payments loan, but potentially no RDTI tax credit to offset the loan.
