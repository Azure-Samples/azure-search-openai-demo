This includes information that is about to be included on the register.Completing your applicationTo request the suppression of your residential address, you’ll need to submit a written application to the Companies Office.If your registered office address or address for service is your residential address, you’ll need to provide the Companies Office with an alternative address for this purpose, and we’ll update your company’s registered office address or address for service details on the register for you. These addresses must be a physical address in New Zealand – they can’t be a PO Box, Private Bag or Document Exchange address.If your online services account lists your residential address, you’ll need to change this online. This is because the address displayed in your account will show to the public on the Companies Register when you file documents online.                                                                                 How to update your personal user                                            information                                We don’t suppress NZBN addresses for office, delivery, postal and invoices, as these are optional to provide.Identifying where your address is publicWhen you apply, you must identify all the places where the residential address you wish to have suppressed is publicly viewable on the Companies Register. Only the details you identify on the application form will be suppressed on the register.If you are a director or a shareholder of multiple companies, you must identify all the companies where your residential address is public and all the documents where your address appears.To view your company’s public documents:Search for your company on the Companies Register website.Select your company from the search results.From the ‘Companies Details’ screen, select the 'Documents' tab.Contact us if you need further help identifying where the residential address is currently public on the register.You may also want to check other registers administered by the Companies Office.All registersDisclaimer        The Companies Office has no control over the use of information obtained from our registers by third parties, such as our bulk data customers. Details suppressed on our registers may be displayed or made publicly available elsewhere without our knowledge especially where the suppressed information has been publicly viewable for some time. In such cases, you can approach the third party directly to request that they be removed.    How to request that your details be suppressed1. Complete the application formThe application to have your details suppressed on the Companies Register must be in writing. Please complete and sign the application form, which can be downloaded below. The declaration must be signed by the person to whom the protection order has been granted.

What happens nextWe’ll approve your application if we’re satisfied that the protection order is in force, and that the suppression will not unduly compromise the public register.You’ll be notified of our decision in writing within 10 working days of the application having been received. We’ll also notify the Family Court that issued the protection order.If your application is approvedWhile the suppression is in force we will not make your details available to the public on the Companies Register (although the suppressed information is still deemed to be ‘included’ on the public register).If you move, you are required by law to update your address on the Companies Register and apply for your new address to be suppressed.Where the order is final        The direction expires 5 years after the date it was made, unless revoked before then, or discharged. Your address will be made public once the direction expires.    If your application is declinedIf your application is declined, you have the right to make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner.If your circumstances or details changeThe suppression of your address details applies only to information included, or about to be included, on the public register when the direction is made. Therefore, if you change your residential address, you'll need to make a new application to have the new details suppressed.If the suppression is no longer required or if the protection order is discharged, please advise us in writing that your address can be made public on the register.Contact us at our email addressfamilyviolence@companiesoffice.govt.nzShareFacebook, opens in a new windowX (formerly Twitter), opens in a new windowLinkedIn, opens in a new windowPrint this page                 Email this page Email this pageHome ›Help centre ›Getting support to use the Companies Register ›Current: Suppressing a residential address on the registerEmail address to send this page link toThis information will not be stored by the Companies Office.Your nameYour name will be shared with the person you're sending this page link to.Any comments you'd like to addYour comments will be shared with the person you're sending this page link to.This form is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.SendAll help topics                            Before you start a company                    5 guidesGet an overview of how companies are structured, find out about the company records you need to keep, and what's involved when you incorporate with and report to the Companies Office.
