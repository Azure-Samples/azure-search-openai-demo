The Lean Group believes Lean sustainability comes from training people at all levels of the organisation, achieving shop-floor improvements while improving office processes and breaking down barriers between departments. Leadership training is a specialty of the company’s approach, generating the skills sets required for long-term success.The Lean Group has worked in many environments – from manufacturing, to agriculture, to web design, to the justice system.Lean Service Delivery Methodologies A typical implementation starts with the analysis phase, which involves two to five days on site to identify the potential opportunities, meet the team and develop an implementation plan. The plan can last for three to 12 months depending on the size of the business, number of staff and training requirements.During the implementation phase organisations can expect to see their challenges resolved, improving customer quality, cost and delivery. Activities include 5S workplace organisation implementation, creation of a measurement and problem-solving framework, value stream mapping activities, and advanced tools such as TPM and SMED if required. All staff complete the famous Lego Lean Simulation. A recent Lean Group customer has seen a 260% productivity increase, and a reduction in lead times from 14 to three days, freeing up two staff to work on other projects. A manufacturing customer has reduced its quality issues by 95%, and gained greater staff engagement. And a local agribusiness customer improved delivery performance from 81% to 100% through better problem solving and staff engagement.BackContactshttps://leangroup.co.nz/Ian Linesi.lines@leangroup.co.nz027 690 0922Areas of experienceFull Lean implementation and change managementProblem solving, root cause analysisLean tools, 5S, value stream mapping Quality improvement Measurement frameworksAdvanced tools, SMED, TPMTransition specialists Sector experienceManufacturingAgricultureServiceConstruction, fabrication and buildingFMCGSector expertiseWorking with us onLean CoachingPricingRates range from $1,200–$2,000 per day, depending on the type and length of commission.Related ProductsPrevNext1 / 1Lean CoachingMinimise waste, maximise efficiency and make continual improvements to your processes, by learning the methods and philosophy that transformed the modern manufacturing industry.Read moreArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
