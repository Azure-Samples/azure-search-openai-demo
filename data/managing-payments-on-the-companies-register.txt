If there's a fee, we let you know how much it is and offer several payment options. You're responsible for the payment of all fees charged to your online services account, no matter who uses it.Schedule of feesOur schedule of fees shows which online services require payment of a fee.                                                                                 Schedule of                                            fees                                Where an online service has a fee attached, a message appears showing the fee and giving you the option to Pay Now, or Exit without completing the transaction.Selecting a payment methodThe most practical payment method for you, or an organisation you're acting for, can depend on:how frequently you use the Companies Register, andhow many people are linked to, and completing transactions on an online services account.We offer the following payment methods.Direct debit — useful if you use our services regularly and want to receive an invoice, and pay your account each month.Credit card or debit card — practical if you use our services from time to time and want to pay as you go.Internet banking — suitable if you only use our services occasionally and don't want to set up a direct debit or use a credit or debit card. Show all                Paying by direct debit        When you create an individual or an organisational online services account, you're invited to set up a direct debit payment option to pay your online transaction fees. You can also do this at a later time.Important        If you want to use the online services of another Companies Office register, for example, the Limited Partnerships register, you need to:set up a separate direct debit payment option on that register, orchoose another method of payment to pay the fee, for example, credit or debit card.    How direct debit worksOur direct debit payment option allows you to complete transactions online and charge them to your online services account. You then receive an invoice at the end of each month. The amount of that invoice is deducted from your nominated bank account on the 20th of the following month. If the 20th falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the payment is processed the next business day.The direct debit payment option can be added to an individual or organisation online services account.Where your individual online services account is linked to an organisation's account — for example, as an employee — you'll be asked to confirm whether you're performing the transaction on behalf of that organisation, or yourself. If you select:'for my employer' (the organisation) fees will be added to the organisation's account.'for myself', fees must be paid at the time using a credit card or debit card or internet banking.What information you need to provideTo set up the direct debit payment option you need to provide:details for the bank account from which funds will be deducted each monthan email address, so we can send a Direct Debit Authority Form for you to sign and returnan email address where we can send your monthly invoices.Note        We may perform a credit check on your company — or you, if you're applying for the direct debit option for your own user account — through a credit reference agency.

Until then, you can still use your online services account, but must pay any fees by credit or debit card.                Your payment details                    Pay by credit or debit card        If you use our online services less frequently, credit or debit card payment is a practical payment option.We accept the following credit and debit cards.VisaMastercardAmerican ExpressDiners.We offer secure credit and debit card transaction facilities and your payment, if successful, is confirmed immediately on screen and by email.Card security code required        You must provide the 3 digit Card Security Code (CSC) on the back of your card when completing an online transaction. For American Express cards, it's the 4 digit code on the front of your card.                    Pay using internet banking        If you haven't set up a direct debit payment option, and don't have a credit or debit card, you can pay your online services account fees using internet banking. We use the Windcave payment gateway.                     Windcave        If you choose this method of payment, you'll be asked to log in to your bank account via a secure Windcave webpage.There are situations where you can't use internet banking        For security reasons, payments that need to be authorised by more than 1 bank signatory for a company can't be made using internet banking.
