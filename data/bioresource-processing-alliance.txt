We’re rightly proud of the produce that comes from our shores.For every organic product that makes it to the store shelves, a range of by-products are created: waste produced from growing, harvest and processing, or goods that fall short of standards.Finding new ways of squeezing value from these by-products is critically important to the hard-working producers, not only to make every acre profitable, but also to protect and enhance our environment for many generations to come.The Bioresource Processing Alliance (BPA) was formed with the explicit purpose of finding value in New Zealand’s biological by-products. Made up of four leading research agencies and organisations — including Callaghan Innovation — the alliance offers the primary industries access to world-renowned scientists and engineers. We’re proud to add our extensive experience in food science and technology to the alliance’s offering.The alliance offers an open invitation to curious, eager and outside-of-the-box thinking businesses to bring forward their by-product challenges and work with one of the four research groups. Research is co-funded, helping to not only accelerate innovation, but also de-risk commercialisation.The aim is to provide unique and exciting solutions that make a substantial difference to the environment, the profits of producers, and the products ending up on our shelves.We’re proud to be sharing in these challenges with three other exceptional research organisations.Benefits to your businessFill 1 Copy 2Find new valueTurn your by-products and waste into valuable products and goods.Fill 1 Copy 2Reduce your impactContribute to a circular economy and minimise your impact on the environment.Fill 1 Copy 2De-risk new opportunitiesMarket, technical and economic feasibility as part of the research.Fill 1 Copy 2Access leading experts from four agenciesLeverage the leading minds from four leading research agencies to find the best possible outcomes.Is this right for me?Best suited toBusinesses in the forestry, marine, agriculture, horticulture, dairy, wool and meat processing sectors, based in New Zealand, can apply to the BPA for research.Applications need to be submitted by one of the Alliance Partners or a University.
