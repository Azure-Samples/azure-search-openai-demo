By embracing new technologies and innovation in Residential Construction, Vertical construction and Horizontal Construction, the country can build more sustainable, efficient, and resilient infrastructure for the future.Callaghan Innovation is working alongside industry sector partners to build a more collaborative, productive, innovative, and sustainable construction industry. The Construction Innovation Mission’s Vision is for Aotearoa New Zealand to be a leader in Construction Innovation within the Small Advanced Economies group and within the OECD.If your business could play a part in creating a more advanced, innovative and exciting Construction sector, we want to hear from you.Areas of focusThe term Construction innovation broadly refers to the introduction of new or improved technologies, materials, processes, and methods in the construction industry that increase efficiency, productivity, safety, and sustainability.Areas of construction innovation that we have experience in, and are looking to enhance for Aotearoa New Zealand, include:Fill 1 Copy 2Digital ConstructionBuilding Information Modelling, Digital Twins, AR, VR, AI, machine learning, IoT sensors, photogrammetry / 3D scanning.Fill 1 Copy 2Sustainable ConstructionSmart materials like bioplastics, smart composites, renewable energy, thermal efficiency, acoustics materials, low-carbon cement, low-carbon steel, natural fibre insulation materials, construction and demolition waste-to-value, etc.Fill 1 Copy 2OSM (Off-Site Manufacturing) ConstructionPrefabrication, Advanced Manufacturing / Industry 4.0, 3D printing.Fill 1 Copy 2Business Model InnovationMarket validation, commercialisation strategy, investment-readiness, innovation road-mapping, business strategy, joint ventures, partnerships, prototyping, new product development support, etc.Enhancing the sectorBetween 2021 and 2022, we’ve grown the number of Construction businesses that we’ve supported from 186 to 374.145 businesses have received funding and advisory support through our products and the Whare.
