My training is in microbiology and I work manipulating microorganisms, including bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeasts, at both molecular and flask/agar plate scales. My expertise lies in the production of microbial biomass, metabolites, recombinant proteins/enzymes, as well as the testing of antimicrobial activities of bioactive materials.One of my biggest inspirations comes from the diversity of ideas brought forward by our clients. I love the unique perspectives and concepts they present, which I had never considered or heard of before. Collaborating with our clients provides me with real opportunities to learn and explore novel concepts within the laboratory setting.One of my notable contributions at Callaghan Innovation is assisting clients in developing prototype products. The successful commercialisation of these products including new patents, establishment of manufacturing facilities, and mass production showcases the tangible impact of my work.I am a proud member of the New Zealand Microbiological Society and the Royal Society of New Zealand (MRSNZ). I am driven by the excitement of embracing new challenges and the opportunity to make a positive impact. Every day, I focus on guiding, collaborating, and advancing the field of biotechnologies. Together, my team explores new possibilities, pushes the boundaries of scientific discovery, and drives innovation in bioprocessing and fermentation.BackAreas of expertiseIsolation, purification and identification of environmental microorganismsMicrobial culturing and optimisation at lab scale for scale up (bacteria, fungi and yeast)Genome-wide microbial genetic analysisMicrobial genetic modification (bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeast)Construction of expression systems for recombinant proteins, enzymes and bioactive metabolitesMicrobial inhibition analysis of bioactive materialsEducationPhD, Microbiology, The University of Adelaide, 2001MSc, Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1995BSc, Microbiology, Sichuan University, 1992Memberships and awardsMember of New Zealand Microbiological SocietyMember of the Royal Society of New Zealand (MRSNZ)Selected publicationsChapter 2: Fundamentals of Fermentation Media, Allikian, K.; Edgar, R.; Syed, R.; Zhang, S., In: Berenjian, A.
