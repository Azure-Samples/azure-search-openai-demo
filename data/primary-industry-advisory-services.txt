The video has been launched by Agriculture and Investment Services, in collaboration with the Opportunity Grows Here campaign.The video tells the story of farm adviser Ash Phillips. It provides insight into the diverse role of a farm adviser while showing how further study in the agricultural sector can lead to greater career opportunities.Farm Adviser – Ash Phillips – YouTube Strategy to replace certification scheme for advisersThe National Certification Scheme for farm environment plan advisers set up under this programme in 2020 has been wound down. The scheme was superseded by the Ministry for the Environment's work on requirements for Freshwater Farm Plan certifiers and auditors. While mandatory freshwater farm plans will start to be introduced in 2023, they will be phased in throughout New Zealand over time. This will require numbers of certifiers and auditors to be appointed by regional councils. The Ministry for the Environment is supporting regional councils with the process to identify and train suitable people.The Ministry for Primary Industries is working with the Ministry for the Environment on advisory workforce planning. MPI is also investigating the potential for a wider workforce development strategy aimed at lifting capability across the wide range of advisory careers in the primary sectors. This work looks at the settings for the structure of the workforce, including oversight and governance, qualifications and skills, and education and training systems.More information about how MPI is helping to strengthen the rural advisory sector is available on 'Towards a certified Freshwater Farm Plan system'Regional educationMPI provides regional seminars and events where advisers can get together and learn about important issues in the primary sector. We'll post upcoming events here.Email us if you have questionsinfo@mpi.govt.nzFeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
