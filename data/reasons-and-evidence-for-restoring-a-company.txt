When you apply, you must select the reason that best applies to the situation your company was in when it was removed from the register:The company was carrying on business at the time it was removed and there is a proper reason for it to continue in existence.The company was a party to legal proceedings when it was removed.The company was in receivership, liquidation or both when it was removed.The grounds for removal didn’t exist at the time the company was removed.
