Reference Group (BERG)The report provides a summary of the opportunities to reduce biological greenhouse gas emissions from New Zealand agriculture and the costs and benefits of these opportunities and any barriers to their use. The research covers these themes:Climate change, and farmer decision making.Potential for mitigating emissions.Estimating biological emissions from agriculture.Possible implications of changing land use.The costs and barriers of potential policy options.Find out moreMedia release Download the report  [PDF, 9 MB]Finding ways to reduce emissionsThe Biological Emissions Reference Group (BERG) was established in June 2016. Group members included representatives from agricultural sector organisations and government agencies.The aim was to build a portfolio of evidence covering:opportunities to reduce biological greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) from New Zealand agriculturethe costs and benefits of these opportunities and any barriers to their use.Objectives of the groupThe BERG’s objectives were to:increase industry, government, and public understanding of the current and future sources and drivers of biological emissions, and the potential to reduce their impactbuild an agreed and robust understanding of what can be done to reduce biological emissions, and the costs and opportunities involvedbuild trust and confidence between New Zealand’s primary industries and government agencies.What was not in scope?The BERG did not have the mandate to develop policy or to make recommendations about policy. However, as part of building a portfolio of evidence, the group commissioned analysis to estimate the costs and barriers of hypothetical policy options.The BERG did not commission any analysis that considered different ways of accounting for methane as a short-lived greenhouse gas. Group membership and terms of referenceThe members of the BERG were:Ministry for Primary IndustriesMinistry for the EnvironmentBeef + Lamb New ZealandDairy NZ LimitedDeer Industry New ZealandFederated Farmers of New ZealandThe Fertiliser Association of New ZealandFonterra Cooperative Group LimitedHorticulture New Zealand Download the group's terms of reference  [PDF, 1.2 MB]Background research reports grouped by themeClimate change, and farmer decision making Literature review and analysis of farmer decision making with regard to climate change and biological gas emissions  [PDF, 2.4 MB]Potential for mitigating emissions On-farm options to reduce agricultural GHG emissions in New Zealand  [PDF, 1.5 MB] Future options to reduce biological GHG emissions on-farm: critical assumptions and national-scale impact  [PDF, 3.5 MB]Estimating biological emissions from agriculture Review of the suitability of Overseer® nutrient budgets model for farm-scale greenhouse gas reporting  [PDF, 1013 KB] Carbon Sequestration potential of non-ETS land on farms  [PDF, 1.6 MB]  Possible implications of changing land use Land Use Change as a Mitigation for Climate Change  [PDF, 2.3 MB] Assessing the Nationwide Economic Impacts of Farm Level Biological GHG Emission Mitigation Options  [PDF, 1.6 MB] Appendix 1  [PDF, 549 KB] Appendix 2  [PDF, 405 KB]The costs and barriers of potential policy options Assessment of the administration costs and barriers of scenarios to mitigate biological emissions from agriculture  [PDF, 1 MB] Appendix 1  [PDF, 515 KB]FeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
