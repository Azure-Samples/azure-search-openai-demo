Over my career I have immersed myself in innovation and research and development (R&D). My journey has taken me from the private sector, where I worked with a tech start-up, into research institutes and government organisations.As a communicator with a multidisciplinary approach, I excel at bridging the gap between technology, strategy, futures, communities and industry. I have a knack for identifying opportunities that arise when these different fields intersect. Dr. Paul Wood, an expert in emotional intelligence, has been a source of inspiration for me in this regard. Futures thinking is effective. In a Danish study, companies that were more future-prepared outperformed the average profitability by 33% and 200% higher market capitalization growth.One of my most memorable experiences at Callaghan Innovation was performing the Callaghan Innovation haka alongside customers and colleagues at the NZ High Tech Awards. This powerful cultural performance was our way of celebrating the winners of the inaugural Māori Hi Tech Award and showcase our unity and absolute pride.I relish having the opportunity to contribute to solving significant challenges that have a lasting impact on our future in Aotearoa. Being able to make a difference and tackle these big problems head-on is immensely rewarding. And spending quality time with my children brings me deep joy and serves as a reminder of what truly matters in life.BackAreas of expertiseCommunity EngagementRegional Business PartnershipsFuture InsightsTechnology commercialisationDesign sprint facilitationBusiness DevelopmentStakeholder managementTechnology communicationArtboardProducts and servicesUpskillConnectFundSolveGrowFeatured contentFounder WellbeingIn Focus: Industry 4.0In Focus: Startup SupportAbout usAbout usSir Paul Callaghan (1947-2012)Supporting Pakihi MāoriFrontier Ventures2024 © Callaghan Innovation.
