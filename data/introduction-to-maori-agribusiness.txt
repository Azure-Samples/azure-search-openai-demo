Supporting Māori to make the most of their primary sector assets will assist whānau to meet their needs and aspirations through their whenua. Learn how we're making a difference together.Māori primary sector planManatū Ahua Matua (Ministry for Primary Industries), in partnership with Ngā Pouwhiro Taimatua (the Māori Primary Sector Forum) released a detailed plan to support the Māori food and fibre sector. Māori primary sector plan – Rautaki mo te Taurikura – Embracing change for prosperity  [PDF, 2.8 MB]About the Māori agribusiness teamThe Ministry for Primary Industries' (MPI's) Māori agribusiness team is dedicated to helping Māori landowners and agribusinesses achieve their goals.What we doWe support Māori landowners and agribusinesses across the motu to:build skills and knowledgehighlight opportunities to make whenua more productiveaccess fundingcreate jobsimprove land management practices. Māori Agribusiness – Fact sheet  [PDF, 2.3 MB]How we can helpMāori face a unique set of challenges when developing their whenua. Our network of regional kaimahi can help Māori landowners and agribusinesses to achieve their aspirations through the sustainable development of their primary sector assets. We have 4 programmes.  They are:Māori Agribusiness Pathway to Increased Productivity (MAPIP) programmeMāori Agribusiness Extension (MABx) programmeMāori Agribusiness Workforce programmeMāori Agribusiness Innovation FundSix steps to make improvements to your whenuaWe have identified 6 steps whānau can take to make improvements to their whenua:Establish a project groupDevelop a strategic planComplete a feasibility studyGet owners on boardSet up a governance structureDecide on an operational set-upWe explain the steps in more detail in our pamphlet and video. Increasing the value of Māori land – pamphlet  [PDF, 2.1 MB]Video: The six steps explained (7.35)Transcript - show/hide[This video is narrated off-screen, while the concepts are illustrated in real-time on a white drawing board.]Narrator: Whatungarongaro te tangata toitū te whenua – As man disappears from sight, the land remains.It's important for Māori that the land is retained throughout generations – that's whakapapa; that the important relationship Māori have with the land is recognised – that's whanaungatanga; and that Māori can act as guardians of the land's natural and physical resources – that's kaitiakitanga.Māori will want these values observed when dealing with the estimated ten point 6 billion dollars in primary sector assets that Māori hold.MPI partners with Māori to grow and protect these assets. This helps to further grow the New Zealand economy.MPI has worked with a number of Māori land owners to help them achieve their aspirations on their terms, bringing together smaller land blocks to build economic scale for the benefit of their mokopuna.So how does this happen?For Whaea Tui, and most Māori for that matter, land or whenua is taonga tuku iho – a treasure that has been passed down through generations.Whaea Tui remembers stories of a time when her whānau farmed and lived off their land. Over time whānau has ceased to control the use of their land. Now she wonders what could happen if the land in her area came together. Could this build the assets of the whānau, so that they can manage their land themselves, make decisions on its use and provide for the benefit of her mokopuna?Whaea Tui is determined and driven, which is a great start! But what's got her stumped is figuring out all the different pieces of the puzzle.This is where MPI can help, with staff on the ground across the country working with Māori who have asked the exact same question as Whaea Tui.From these interactions MPI has identified six key steps that have resulted in Māori successfully bringing together smaller land blocks, and are on hand to help Whaea Tui explore her options.Step 1: Establish a project group ("1000 cups of tea")Firstly Whaea Tui needs to go out and talk to people on the surrounding land blocks. Typically they'll be whānau leaders, trustees of land owning groups or key influencers in the groups. Many call this the thousand cups of tea stage.She'll need to sit with the group and discuss what opportunities might be available. These considerations will be everything from discussing the current state of the land to how to best govern that land. If Whaea Tui needs help getting the right people involved, or figuring out the ins-and-outs of what needs to be considered, she can give MPI a call. When some or all of the group are ready, they can move forward.Step 2: Strategic PlanningBack around the table, the next step for Whaea Tui and the Whānau Leaders Group is to develop a plan. This fleshes out the aspirations and objectives of the group and all parties they represent.Development of the plan would identify what the group wants to achieve. Goals like developing the land and establishing a good business, creating education and employment opportunities for whānau, controlling the development of their land, or simply wanting to leave something behind for the next generation.While MPI can help with strategic planning and bringing this process together, figuring out their aspirations is what Whaea Tui and the Whānau Leaders Group need to flesh out on their own.Step 3: Feasibility studyOnce the plan reflects the group's aspirations for their land, it's time to put the land to the test. A feasibility study will determine the best use of the land, and provide enough information for the group to discuss the next best steps forward. It also helps to make the proposed options more real if the group visits the land and gets to visualise in person what is being discussed.MPI knows some great farm consultants who can help kick off this feasibility study, and MPI can also put Whaea Tui in touch with Māori who've taken the same journey and are more than happy to share their knowledge. It's worth a mention that after all this advice and consideration, Whaea Tui and the group may decide not to go ahead.Step 4: Get owners on boardIf Whaea Tui and the group want to continue with one or more of the options, the next step is to explain the opportunity to the wider group, and it's likely you'll be drinking more tea.It can be challenging to get others to understand the benefits of building economic scale, and still be comfortable with the risks that are involved. This is where MPI can help Whaea Tui to explain the benefits and risks, and bring into the loop Māori who have taken the same journey to share their experiences.Step 5: Governance Structure Set-upSo Whaea Tui's got everyone to agree to move forward with an option for their land. Great! Believe it or not that's a lot of the hard work done and dusted. The next step is to put the right people into the right positions to make sure this venture runs as smoothly and successfully as possible.Here is a great opportunity to position whānau alongside the knowledge holders in key positions, so they can learn the tricks of the trade as the venture progresses. What's most important here is adopting a governance structure that ensures all parties retain ownership to the whenua that is important to them. This is where MPI can put Whaea Tui in touch with experts who can make sure this happens.Step 6: Operational Set-upOnce Whaea Tui has her ducks in a row, the rest will fall out of the planning. Whatever option the group has decided to go with will now require set-up and infrastructure, whether it be in:mānuka plantationssheep and beef farmingwheat and barley croppingtimber harvesting, ordairy farming.MPI has networks right across the primary industries who will be able to help Whaea Tui every step of the way.So there it is, 6 key steps that MPI can help you with, to bring smaller land blocks together and build economic scale, for the benefit of your mokopuna:Establish a project groupStrategic planningCompleting a feasibility studyGetting owners on boardSetting up a governance structureSetting up operationsIf you want to explore what options might be possible for your whenua, on your terms, don't hesitate to get in touch.[Logo: Ministry for Primary Industries. www.mpi.govt.nz][End of transcript]Resources on Māori agribusinessTe Ōhanga Māori (The Māori Economy Report 2018) – Reserve Bank of NZ Te Matapaeroa 2019 – Te Puni Kokiri Māori in horticulture (2020 research report) – Te Puni Kokiri An indigenous approach to the living standards framework (2019) – Te Puni Kokiri MPI reports Growing the productive base of Māori freehold land (2013)  [PDF, 1.4 MB] Mid-north (Northland) multiple Māori land blocks  [PDF, 11 MB] Māori agribusiness prototype projects: Final evaluation (2014)  [PDF, 1.6 MB] Growing the productive base of Māori freehold land: Partial national cost-benefit analysis  [PDF, 367 KB] Growing the productive base of Māori freehold land: further evidence and analysis  [PDF, 3.5 MB] Economic analysis of prototype interventions to lift Māori agribusiness productivity (2014)  [PDF, 481 KB]Other MPI resources for Māori Sustainable Food and Fibre FuturesHow MPI and Māori are managing kaimoanaFood safety resources for the maraeCustomary Fisheries Research FundFoot-and-mouth disease preparednessOther resources for MāoriTupu.nz Vision Mātauranga – MBIE Office for Māori Crown Relations – Te Arawhiti Te Puni Kōkiri (TPK) Federation of Māori Authorities Te Tumu Paeroa Who to contactTo find out more or have a kōrero with our regional kaimahi, email maoriagribusiness@mpi.govt.nzFeedbackContact usSubscribe to MPIScienceLegalResources and formsMPI website disclaimerSitemapCopyrightPrivacy and securityMPI business unitsMPI uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
