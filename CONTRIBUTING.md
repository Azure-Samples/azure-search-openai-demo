## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

- Search the repository (<https://github.com/[organization-name>]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed PR
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
- Make your changes in a new git fork
- Follow [Code style conventions](#code-style)
- [Run the tests](#running-unit-tests) (and write new ones, if needed)
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- Push your fork to GitHub
- In GitHub, create a pull request to the `main` branch of the repository
- Ask a maintainer to review your PR and address any comments they might have

## Setting up the development environment

Install the development dependencies:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Install the pre-commit hooks:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Compile the JavaScript:

```shell
( cd ./app/frontend ; npm install ; npm run build )
```

## Running unit tests

Run the tests:

```shell
python -m pytest
```

Check the coverage report to make sure your changes are covered.

```shell
python -m pytest --cov
```

## Running E2E tests

Install Playwright browser dependencies:

```shell
playwright install --with-deps
```

Run the tests:

```shell
python -m pytest tests/e2e.py --tracing=retain-on-failure
```

When a failure happens, the trace zip will be saved in the test-results folder.
You can view that using the Playwright CLI:

```shell
playwright show-trace test-results/<trace-zip>
```

You can also use the online trace viewer at <https://trace.playwright.dev/>

## Code style

This codebase includes several languages: TypeScript, Python, Bicep, Powershell, and Bash.
Code should follow the standard conventions of each language.

For Python, you can enforce the conventions using `ruff` and `black`.

Install the development dependencies:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run `ruff` to lint a file:

```shell
python -m ruff <path-to-file>
```

Run `black` to format a file:

```shell
python -m black <path-to-file>
```

If you followed the steps above to install the pre-commit hooks, then you can just wait for those hooks to run `ruff` and `black` for you.

## Adding new azd environment variables

When adding new azd environment variables, please remember to update:

1. App Service's [azure.yaml](./azure.yaml)
1. [ADO pipeline](.azdo/pipelines/azure-dev.yml).
1. [Github workflows](.github/workflows/azure-dev.yml)

## Adding new UI strings

When adding new UI strings, please remember to update all translations.
For any translations that you generate with an AI tool,
please indicate in the PR description which language's strings were AI-generated.

Here are community contributors that can review translations:
