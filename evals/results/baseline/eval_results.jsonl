When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=10:  When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\".

Out-of-Network Providers Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider. Exceptions Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=3:  In-Network Costs: If you use an in-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs will be lower than if you use an out-of-network provider. This is because Northwind Health has negotiated discounted rates with in-network providers. Out-of-Network Costs: If you use an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for paying the full cost of the services you receive. Additionally, you may have to pay a higher deductible and coinsurance. Prescription Drug Costs: Prescription drug costs are also taken into consideration with Northwind Health Plus. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on the tier of the medication you are prescribed. Generally, brand-name and non-preferred generic medications will have higher out-of-pocket costs than preferred generic and generic medications.
