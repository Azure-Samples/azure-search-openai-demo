In summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services.

Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed. Out-Of-Pocket Maximum IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum Employees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket maximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain covered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket maximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family.Employees should be aware that certain services may not be subject to the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8:  Generally, out-of-network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher.

This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus. In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available.
