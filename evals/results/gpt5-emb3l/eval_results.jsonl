Depending on the type of service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the secondary payer may pay nothing.For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200.

Coordinating benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination helps to ensure that you don't pay more than you should for your health care. When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its allowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference between what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services. The way in which you coordinate benefits will depend on the type of coverage you have. Coordinating Benefits with Medicare If you have Medicare, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=75:  When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember that each health plan is different.

Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services.
