Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement under Northwind Health Plus. This means that after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount. For example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of $80.Coinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=13:  Coinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. Forexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=14:  When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs.

It's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.

When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=10:  When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be. Out-of-Network Providers Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider. Exceptions Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8:  Generally, out-of-network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher. It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus. In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider.
