While there may be some coverage for out-of-network providers, it is often more expensive than using in-network providers. Additionally, services from out-of-network providers may not count towards your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, meaning you could be liable for the full cost minus any applicable discounts. Balance billing may also occur, where the provider bills you for the difference between their charges and what Northwind pays [Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=10][Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8].", "context": "Northwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=10:  When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be. Out-of-Network Providers Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider. Exceptions Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8: Or Non-Contracted Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan.\n\nNorthwind_Health_Plus_Benefits_Details.pdf#page=8:  Generally, out-of-network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher. It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus. In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider.
