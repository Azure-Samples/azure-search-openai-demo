This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.\nWhat is balance billing?\nBalance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance billing when visiting in-network providers.\nWhat is an in-network provider?\nIn-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan's payment terms. Visiting an in-network provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website.\nWhat if I visit an out-of-network provider?",

A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service. The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.\nIn-Network Copays:\nFor in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a copayment of around $50.",

Once this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.\nFor Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of- network services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than in-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that applies.\nExceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible.

This means that after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.\nFor example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100).

However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.\nUnder Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.\nIn-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate.

It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services.\nIt's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost.\nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.\nFinally, it's important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of- pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services.",

With Northwind Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping you to receive the best possible care.\nContinuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won't need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you've already had done.\nThere are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your insurance plan.

This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your provider's policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front.

Coordination of Benefits is a process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plansavailable. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket for care.\nWhen Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first), any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.\nThe amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service.

Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.\nWhen it comes to subrogation and reimbursement, it is important to note that Northwind Health Plus reserves the right to subrogate and reimburse any payments made for medical services.
