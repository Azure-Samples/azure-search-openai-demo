## Adding new data

New files should be added to the `data` folder, and then either run scripts/prepdocs.sh or scripts/prepdocs.ps1 to ingest the data.

## Adding a new azd environment variable

An azd environment variable is stored by the azd CLI for each environment. It is passed to the "azd up" command and can configure both provisioning options and application settings.
When adding new azd environment variables, update:

1. infra/main.parameters.json : Add the new parameter with a Bicep-friendly variable name and map to the new environment variable
1. infra/main.bicep: Add the new Bicep parameter at the top, and add it to the `appEnvVariables` object
1. .azdo/pipelines/azure-dev.yml: Add the new environment variable under `env` section
1. .github/workflows/azure-dev.yml: Add the new environment variable under `env` section

You may also need to update:

1. app/backend/prepdocs.py: If the variable is used in the ingestion script, retrieve it from environment variables here. Not always needed.
1. app/backend/app.py: If the variable is used in the backend application, retrieve it from environment variables in setup_clients() function. Not always needed.

## Adding a new setting to "Developer Settings" in RAG app

When adding a new developer setting, update:

* frontend:
  * app/frontend/src/api/models.ts : Add to ChatAppRequestOverrides
  * app/frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx : Add a UI element for the setting
  * app/frontend/src/locales/*/translations.json: Add a translation for the setting label/tooltip for all languages
  * app/frontend/src/pages/chat/Chat.tsx: Add the setting to the component, pass it to Settings

* backend:
  * app/backend/approaches/chatreadretrieveread.py :  Retrieve from overrides parameter
  * app/backend/app.py: Some settings may need to be sent down in the /config route.

## When adding tests for a new feature

All tests are in the `tests` folder and use the pytest framework.
There are three styles of tests:

* e2e tests: These use playwright to run the app in a browser and test the UI end-to-end. They are in e2e.py and they mock the backend using the snapshots from the app tests. (Before running e2e tests, make sure to run `npm run build` in app/frontend first to build the frontend code.)
* app integration tests: Mostly in test_app.py, these test the app's API endpoints and use mocks for services like Azure OpenAI and Azure Search.
* unit tests: The rest of the tests are unit tests that test individual functions and methods. They are in test_*.py files.

When adding a new feature, add tests for it in the appropriate file.
If the feature is a UI element, add an e2e test for it.
If it is an API endpoint, add an app integration test for it.
If it is a function or method, add a unit test for it.
Use mocks from tests/conftest.py to mock external services. Prefer mocking at the HTTP/requests level when possible.

When you're running tests, make sure you activate the .venv virtual environment first:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To check for coverage, run the following command:

```shell
pytest --cov --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate
```

Open the cov_annotate directory to view the annotated source code. There will be one file per source file. If a file has 100% source coverage, it means all lines are covered by tests, so you do not need to open the file.

For each file that has less than 100% test coverage, find the matching file in cov_annotate and review the file.

If a line starts with a ! (exclamation mark), it means that the line is not covered by tests. Add tests to cover the missing lines.

## Sending pull requests

When sending pull requests, make sure to follow the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md format.

## Upgrading dependencies

To upgrade a particular package in the backend, use the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to upgrade:

```shell
cd app/backend && uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --python-version 3.10 --upgrade-package package-name
```

## Checking Python type hints

To check Python type hints, use the following command:

```shell
ty check
```

Note that we do not currently enforce type hints in the tests folder, as it would require adding a lot of `# type: ignore` comments to the existing tests.
We only enforce type hints in the main application code and scripts.

## Python code style

Do not use single underscores in front of "private" methods or variables in Python code. We do not follow that convention in this codebase, since this is an application and not a library.

## Deploying the application

To deploy the application, use the `azd` CLI tool. Make sure you have the latest version of the `azd` CLI installed. Then, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```shell
azd up
```

That command will BOTH provision the Azure resources AND deploy the application code.

If you only changed the Bicep templates and want to re-provision the Azure resources, run:

```shell
azd provision
```

If you only changed the application code and want to re-deploy the code, run:

```shell
azd deploy
```

If you are using cloud ingestion and only want to deploy individual functions, run the necessary deploy commands, for example:

```shell
azd deploy document-extractor
azd deploy figure-processor
azd deploy text-processor
```
