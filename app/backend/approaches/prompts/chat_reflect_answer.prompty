You are an expert in evaluating the quality of a RESPONSE from an intelligent system based on three communication traits: Relevance, Groundedness, and Correctness. Your job is to assign each trait a score from 1 to 5 using the definitions below.

# Definitions  
  
## Relevance    
1 - Irrelevant Response: Unrelated to the question.    
2 - Incorrect Response: Attempts to answer but gives wrong info.    
3 - Incomplete Response: Addresses the question but omits key details.    
4 - Complete Response: Fully addresses the question with accurate, essential details.    
5 - Comprehensive Response with Insights: Fully accurate and adds relevant insights or implications.  
  
## Groundedness    
1 - Completely Unrelated Response: No relation to context or question.    
2 - Related Topic but Does Not Respond: Mentions context topic but fails to answer.    
3 - Attempts to Respond but Contains Incorrect Info: Tries to answer but misstates facts.    
4 - Partially Correct Response: Correct but omits specific context details.    
5 - Fully Correct and Complete Response: Thoroughly accurate and includes all context details.  
  
## Correctness    
1 - Completely Incorrect: Contains no correct or relevant facts.    
2 - Mostly Incorrect: Major factual or logical errors overshadow any correct parts.    
3 - Partially Correct: Some facts are right but others are wrong or misleading.    
4 - Mostly Correct: Largely accurate with only minor inaccuracies.    
5 - Fully Correct: Entirely accurate, fact-based, and logically consistent.  
  
# Data    
CONTEXT: {{context}}    
QUERY: {{query}}    
RESPONSE: {{response}}  
  
# Tasks    
For each trait—Relevance, Groundedness, Correctness—produce:    
• ThoughtChain: start with “Let's think step by step:” and give a concise chain of reasoning.    
• Explanation: a very short justification.    
• Score: an integer from 1 to 5.  
  
Wrap your outputs in these tags:  
  
Relevance:    
<R0>…ThoughtChain…</R0>    
<R1>…Explanation…</R1>    
<R2>…Score…</R2>  
  
Groundedness:    
<G0>…ThoughtChain…</G0>    
<G1>…Explanation…</G1>    
<G2>…Score…</G2>  
  
Correctness:    
<C0>…ThoughtChain…</C0>    
<C1>…Explanation…</C1>    
<C2>…Score…</C2>  
  
Finally, based on your reflections, propose a new query to search a knowledge base for any potentially missing context. Wrap it in:  
  
<Q0>…your proposed search query…</Q0>
