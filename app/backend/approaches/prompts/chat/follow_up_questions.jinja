Generate 3 very brief follow-up questions that the user would likely ask next.
Enclose the follow-up questions in double angle brackets. Example:
<<Are there exclusions for prescriptions?>>
<<Which pharmacies can be ordered from?>>
<<What is the limit for over-the-counter medication?>>
Do not repeat questions that have already been asked.
Make sure the last question ends with ">>".
