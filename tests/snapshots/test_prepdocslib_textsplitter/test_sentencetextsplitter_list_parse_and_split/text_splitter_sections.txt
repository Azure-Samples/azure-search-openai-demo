For example, preventive care services, such as \nimmunizations and annual physic als, are covered at 100% with no deductible.

    " The Northwind Standard plan has a large \nnetwork of in -network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are \nnot paying more than you have to for services.  \nThird, consider using a health savings account (H SA). An HSA is a tax -advantaged savings \naccount that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are \ntax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical \ncosts.  \nFinally, take advantage of an y discount programs that may be available.

Coinsurance is often a percentage  of the cost of the service you receive. For example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the \nservice you ",
    " For example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the \nservice you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.  \nUnder Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set a t 20% for in -network services, with some \nexceptions. For in -network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%.

This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what \nis allowed by the pl an, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the \nactual cost.  \nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard \nwill allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need \nservices but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.  \nFinally, it\u2019s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out -of-pocket \nmaximum.
