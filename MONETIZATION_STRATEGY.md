   • Make.com was too slow (5 sec per action)
   • No one automated browser workflows properly

2/ So we built it ourselves. Now it does:
   ✅ <100ms automation (50x faster)
   ✅ $29/month (not $600)
   ✅ Full browser automation
   ✅ Your own AI search engine

3/ We're launching to 100 beta users tomorrow.
   Free Pro tier for first month.

4/ Comparison:
   You: <100ms, $29, unlimited browser automation
   Zapier: 1-5s, $600, limited
   Make.com: 1-3s, $300, limited
