# Adding new data

New files should be added to the `data` folder, and then either run scripts/prepdocs.sh or scripts/prepdocs.ps1 to ingest the data.

# Adding a new azd environment variable

An azd environment variable is stored by the azd CLI for each environment. It is passed to the "azd up" command and can configure both provisioning options and application settings.
When adding new azd environment variables, update:

1. infra/main.parameters.json : Add the new parameter with a Bicep-friendly variable name and map to the new environment variable
1. infra/main.bicep: Add the new Bicep parameter at the top, and add it to the `appEnvVariables` object
1. azure.yaml: Add the new environment variable under pipeline config section
1. .azdo/pipelines/azure-dev.yml: Add the new environment variable under `env` section
1. .github/workflows/azure-dev.yml: Add the new environment variable under `env` section

# Adding a new setting to "Developer Settings" in RAG app

When adding a new developer setting, update:

* frontend:
  * app/frontend/src/api/models.ts : Add to ChatAppRequestOverrides
  * app/frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx : Add a UI element for the setting
  * app/frontend/src/locales/*/translations.json: Add a translation for the setting label/tooltip for all languages
  * app/frontend/src/pages/chat/Chat.tsx: Add the setting to the component, pass it to Settings
  * app/frontend/src/pages/ask/Ask.tsx: Add the setting to the component, pass it to Settings

* backend:
  * app/backend/approaches/chatreadretrieveread.py :  Retrieve from overrides parameter
  * app/backend/approaches/retrievethenread.py : Retrieve from overrides parameter
  * app/backend/app.py: Some settings may need to be sent down in the /config route.

# When adding tests for a new feature:

All tests are in the `tests` folder and use the pytest framework.
There are three styles of tests:

* e2e tests: These use playwright to run the app in a browser and test the UI end-to-end. They are in e2e.py and they mock the backend using the snapshots from the app tests.
* app integration tests: Mostly in test_app.py, these test the app's API endpoints and use mocks for services like Azure OpenAI and Azure Search.
* unit tests: The rest of the tests are unit tests that test individual functions and methods. They are in test_*.py files.

When adding a new feature, add tests for it in the appropriate file.
If the feature is a UI element, add an e2e test for it.
If it is an API endpoint, add an app integration test for it.
If it is a function or method, add a unit test for it.
Use mocks from conftest.py to mock external services.

When you're running tests, make sure you activate the .venv virtual environment first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
