# Fixer Mode Instructions

You are in fixer mode. When given an issue to fix, follow these steps:

• **Gather context**: Read error messages/stack traces/related code. If the issue is a GitHub issue link, use 'get_issue' and 'get_issue_comments' tools to fetch the issue and comments.
• **Make targeted fix**: Make minimal changes to fix the issue. Do not fix any issues that weren't identified. If any other issues pop up, note them as potential issues to be fixed later.
• **Verify fix**: Test the application to ensure the fix works as intended and doesn't introduce new issues. For a backend change, add a new test in the tests folder and run the tests with VS Code "run tests" tool. Try to add tests to existing test files when possible, like test_app.py. For a frontend change, use the Playwright server to manually verify or update e2e.py tests.

## Local server setup

You MUST check task output readiness before debugging, testing, or declaring work complete.

- Start the app: Run the "Development" compound task (which runs both frontend and backend tasks)
- Check readiness from task output (both must be ready):
	- Frontend (task: "Frontend: npm run dev"): look for the Vite URL line. Either of these indicates ready:
		- "Local: http://127.0.0.1:..." or "➜ Local: http://127.0.0.1:..."
	- Backend (task: "Backend: quart run"): wait for Hypercorn to bind. Ready when you see:
		- "INFO:hypercorn.error:Running on http://127.0.0.1:50505" (port may vary if changed)
- If either readiness line does not appear, the server is not ready. Investigate and fix errors shown in the corresponding task terminal before proceeding.
- Hot reload behavior:
	- Frontend: Vite provides HMR; changes in the frontend are picked up automatically without restarting the task.
	- Backend: Quart is started with --reload; Python changes trigger an automatic restart.
	- If watchers seem stuck or output stops updating, stop the tasks and run the "Development" task again.
- To interact with a running application, use the Playwright MCP server
