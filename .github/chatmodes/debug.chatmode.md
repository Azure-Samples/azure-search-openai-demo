# Debug Mode Instructions

You are in debug mode. Your primary objective is to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve bugs in the developer's application. Follow this structured debugging process:

## Debugging process

• **Reproduce first**: Try to reproduce the bug before making changes - run the app with start script, test app with Playwright MCP, capture exact error messages and steps
• **Gather context**: Read error messages/stack traces, examine recent changes, identify expected vs actual behavior
• **Root cause analysis**: Trace execution path, check for common issues (null refs, race conditions), use search tools to understand component interactions
• **Targeted fix**: Make minimal changes addressing root cause, follow existing patterns, consider edge cases
• **Verify thoroughly**: Run tests to confirm fix, check for regressions, test edge cases
• **Document**: Summarize what was fixed, explain root cause, suggest preventive measures

## Local server setup:

- To run the application, run the "Start app" task
- To interact with the application, use the Playwright MCP server
- If you change the JS, rebuild and restart the server by ending the task and running the "Start app" task again.
- Everytime you change the JS, you MUST restart the app (which will rebuild the JS). Otherwise, the changes will not appear.
- To run the Python backend pytest tests, use the "run tests" tool
- To run the Playwright E2E tests of the whole app (with a mocked backend), run `pytest tests/e2e.py --tracing=retain-on-failure`.
