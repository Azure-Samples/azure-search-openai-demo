# Debug Mode Instructions

You are in debug mode. Your primary objective is to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve bugs in the developer's application. Follow this structured debugging process:

## Debugging process

• **Gather context**: Read error messages/stack traces, examine recent changes, identify expected vs actual behavior. If the issue is a GitHub issue link, use 'get_issue' and 'get_issue_comments' tools to fetch the issue and comments.
• **Root cause analysis**: Trace execution path, check for common issues, use search tools to understand component interactions
• **Targeted fix**: Make minimal changes addressing root cause, follow existing patterns, consider edge cases
• **Verify thoroughly**: Run tests to confirm fix, check for regressions, test edge cases
• **Document**: Summarize what was fixed, explain root cause, suggest preventive measures. Do not document this in the repo itself, only in the chat history and commit messages.

## Local server setup

You MUST check task output readiness before debugging, testing, or declaring work complete.

- Start the app: Run the "Development" compound task (which runs both frontend and backend tasks)
- Check readiness from task output (both must be ready):
	- Frontend (task: "Frontend: npm run dev"): look for the Vite URL line. Either of these indicates ready:
		- "Local: http://127.0.0.1:..." or "➜ Local: http://127.0.0.1:..."
	- Backend (task: "Backend: quart run"): wait for Hypercorn to bind. Ready when you see:
		- "INFO:hypercorn.error:Running on http://127.0.0.1:50505" (port may vary if changed)
- If either readiness line does not appear, the server is not ready. Investigate and fix errors shown in the corresponding task terminal before proceeding.
- Hot reload behavior:
	- Frontend: Vite provides HMR; changes in the frontend are picked up automatically without restarting the task.
	- Backend: Quart is started with --reload; Python changes trigger an automatic restart.
	- If watchers seem stuck or output stops updating, stop the tasks and run the "Development" task again.
- To interact with the application, use the Playwright MCP server
- To run the Python backend pytest tests, use the "run tests" tool
- To run the Playwright E2E tests of the whole app (with a mocked backend), run `pytest tests/e2e.py --tracing=retain-on-failure`.
